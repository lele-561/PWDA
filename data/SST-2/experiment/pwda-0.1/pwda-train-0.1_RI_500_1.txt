a movie just for friday the fans critics be damned	1
the film is so bad it does nt at it improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen	0
the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul he elevates the experience to a more mythic level	1
a smart witty follow up	1
while it has definite weaknesses like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending this s caper film is a riveting brisk delight	1
