brims with passion for words for its eccentric accident of characters and for the stories that keep it going in this crazy world	1
too much of it anyway	0

made me feel like i was famous as the queasy stomached critic who ran from the theater and blacked out in the lobby	0
the overall effect is awe and affection and a strange urge to get on a board and uh shred dude	1
the idea of watching blobby old school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to make me smile	1
a grittily beautiful film that doesnt feel like a film at all and feels more like an extended open ended poem than a traditionally structured story	1

a thoroughly engaging surprisingly touching piece of comedy	1
my favorite big fat greek romance that breaks down stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor	1
