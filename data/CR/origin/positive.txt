i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
just a little overview powershot g is the flagship of canon is powershot series and its an slr like camera its megapixel and full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance	1
whether you are a novice or an expert its ease of use and functionality goes together	1
overall i m happy with my toy	1
in a word awesome is how i would describe this camera	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
with the automatic settings i really have nt taken a bad picture yet	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality	1
the g is loaded with many useful features and unlike many smaller digital cameras it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful	1
the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
x zoom is nice	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it is class	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
the prints are beautiful	1
although canon is batteries are proprietary they last a really long time recharge fairly quickly in the camera plus if you want more power you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon	1
this is a great camera for you	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
i love having the option to manually control the f stop shutter speed and even focus	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority aperture priority or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
you feel like you are holding something of substance not some cheap plastic toy	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
this is my first digital camera and i am very pleased with it	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
but at the same time it takes wonderful pictures very easily in auto mode so that even an average joe like me can use it	1
four megapixels is great	1
it is a very amazing product	1
i highly recommend it	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
takes excellent photos	1
night mode is clear as day	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
the picture quality are so great it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging how could one eat rice one grain at a time	1
i love this camera	1
took hundreds of pictures and they were great	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
has x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
the camera was a marvel	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g hardware	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
manual functionality is excellent downloading pictures is quick and a breeze and the quality is astounding	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
having used it for more than a month i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility	1
battery life is over hours compared to about hours for the g or the hours for most nikons	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the shape of this device is a little squarer without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right	1
perhaps inspired by the canon is factory white correction settings the g has much sharper white offsets	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
this is quite simply the best you can ask for	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
the powershot g is a great camera	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
megapixels is plenty for all but pros and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
they look fantastic	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
with canon you get pictures that appear to be photos not still camcorder shots	1
i love the eos based controls and easy menus	1
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires and also used it at the iguazu falls and could not have asked for more perfect performance	1
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera	1
i ve only had it a week but so far everything about this camera is making me happy	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
the optical zoom is awesome and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom	1
the best megapixel x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use	1
because this camera is beautiful	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
it is very simple to import via iphoto and then move them to photoshop	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep	1
yes i recommend it over the competition	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
first and foremost it will take better pic is than most film camera is	1
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
in general it is easy to use and well laid out	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
the g has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out	1
learning how to use it will not take very long	1
the image quality is excellent	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
in terms of the shots taken this camera is insanely great	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow car boat and wind	1
the camera is a work of art science that is understood	1
it takes great pictures operates quickly and feels solid	1
everything else about the camera is great	1
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder i highly recommend the camera	1
and so far i ve been very pleased	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
very comfortable camera easy to use and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
all in all i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon and is better than anything else i ve seen	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
definetely a great camera	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
feels solid in hand	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
i really liked the size so i researched what to buy and this was it	1
this computer has an excellent screen size and quality lrb for a netbook rrb	1
the full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color	1
that is surface stuff but the speed and memory is very good	1
this really is a laptop in a small form	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
overall a sweet machine	1
it is very light weight which is why i use this more than my alienware	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
i really love this netbook	1
i ve had this monitor for over a year and i absolutely love it	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
this netbook is exactly what i want for my kids	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
great replacement at great price for an older bulky and heavy monitor	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
seems like a good product	1
excellent monitor	1
clear and crispy image	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
i m not a person well read in technology but this is just an absolutely wonderful computer	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1

our purchase of an acer monitor was just as we expected	1
easy to hook up	1
great picture	1
i am very happy with this monitor	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
then i would say that this lcd monitor have many feature in one piece	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
it costs me about so you should be gratefull that the pricess in the states much lower	1
i m glad i went with it it actually exceeds my viewsonic for color brightness and pixel quality	1
though it does nt have quite the screen real estate it is an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of x	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
the colors are clear also	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
i really enjoy this product	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
i seem to be getting to hours on the battery which is sufficient for my needs	1
this netbook is very light but still powerful	1
screen brightness is really good	1
this netbook is closer to the notebook powers but still very cheap	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
i love this monitor	1

fits perfectly in the corner of my small desk	1
the images are vivid and crisp the text and fonts are very clear	1
absolutely love it and cant beat the price	1
this monitor works great	1
easy to set up no bad pixels great price for lcd monitor	1
both are absolutely great items	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
compared to the dell monitor this replaced it is far brighter and weighs much less	1
very easy to set up	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
this sleek looking monitor is absolutely awesome	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i have nt really need any since the display have proven to be very intelligent when resizing different screen res is and i can use the ati drivers to adjust things like color temp and gamma	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
battery last longer too	1
purchased this item because of reviews and price	1
excellent very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good i recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to venezuela	1
fits nicely on the small desk we use in our computer room	1

its definately an outstanding laptop	1
it is far from expensive for the specifications but there is a lot more than in there i like it so much its nicely designed for the portable user and i like the ferrari design on it	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
sharp crisp images	1
delivery was prompt	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	1

this is a very nice monitor matte black and built in speakers	1
sharp image	1
relatively small desktop footprint too	1
very fast delivery	1
ca nt beat it for the price	1
this led monitor is fantastic	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
i was a little skeptical because of how cheap it was	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
the colors and everything are great	1
i exchanged this from an lg that i bought for nearly twice as much and the colors on the lg were not at all as nice as this	1
i thot my original monitor had a good image but the s hl has a much brighter display	1
this monitor is much much better but still not great	1
the colors and viewing angle are about average but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
the clarity and contrast are exactly what i was looking for in a monitor and spec for spec it is a bargain compared to other brands	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
however the view angle on this thing is so big that you will see very clearly on any desk viewing situation you normally run across	1
i have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that i ve heard about with other acer models	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i am very happy with the acer inch flat screen monitor which i received for christmas	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
i m very satisfied with it especially for he price	1
good monitor for the price	1
the colors are bright beautiful and clear	1
i am in the business and have seen many lcd monitors that sell for much much more and aside from monitors with a higher resolution lrb ie x rrb there is no noticable difference at all	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
very smooth	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
so far i am super happy with this small yet powerful enough laptop	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
this x monitor fits my space very well	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
the screen is a very pleasing matte and the colors are great	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
it has good color and price was great	1
fantastic display do nt understand why this model is nt available anymore	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
the idea of this device is great it picks up a day weather forecast from accuweather and displays the key elements on its screen	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
these monitors are great for the price	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
no dead pixels on mine	1
the price is very good	1
however i now have it running nicely and it produces a nice picture	1
the monitors were both good	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
apple is wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini	1
the memory is not really hard to upgrade	1
this is an excellent value	1
not that apple computers break down often but this is cheap insurance for years	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
overall it is an impressive display	1
im a more happier person after discovering the i p button	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
it practically plays almost everything you give it	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
it is very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout and it has a great feature set	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
it plays alternate video formats very well	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
it sure does	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
at double speed it still plays mp s with sound they are pitch corrected and smooth but twice as fast	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
i took it to my father is house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
i liked this one enough to buy another	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
great quality picture and features	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i bought mine in december of and have had no real problems with it	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
nothing has broken on it and it plays all the dvds i have	1
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
well it was nice while it lasted	1
this dvd player plays raw mpeg and mpeg videos jpeg wma cdr cdrw dvdr dvdrw and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff progressive scan feature	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
the cool thing about the ad it plays alot of different file like mp wma cds jpeg and kodak picture cds dvd is dvd r is	1
it is not a listed feature but the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
it is low profile space saving design looks nice	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
loved the slim design	1
audio is excellent	1
i am very pleased with the apex ad it plays just about anything you put in the drawer	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
simple to use and hook up	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player	1
and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey	1
finally amazon is free shipping is really getting good it took only working days for the player to reach me	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
we are overall pleased with product	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
output through component connections looks very good on my non hd tv	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
i like the auto fit feature you can stretch widescreen dvd is to normal	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
this thing plays everything i feed it	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
easy to use small form factor and looks good to boot	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
so much packed in a small case and very affordable	1
it is a compact attractive machine and was easy to set up	1
basic usage is easy but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used	1
so far we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
it works well enough for me to be satisfied with it and it is possible that i m missing something	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
there are a lot of things i like about it	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display	1
it works great	1
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good but my feeling at this time is two thumbs up	1
it seems to be working fine but we ve not used it all that much	1
the player looked good right out of the box offering lots of features and good styling	1
amazon is awaesome	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it is nice to know that there re there	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
besides the one problem this machine is amazing	1
it plays everything even vcd is	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
owner is manual has substandard troubleshooting guide	1
the dvd player is fine	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough	1
there were a few attractive features such as the small size and the layout of the remote	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
ability to play most discs i tried dvd vcd dvd r audio cd and it played all	1
good looks	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
also very light and portable	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far	1
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp s and jpegs	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
good quality video	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture zoom etc	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
noiseless lightweight and oh yeah	1
works great	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
it plays just about any format	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
no matter the format	1
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
comes with a mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit included is fast and small	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results	1
the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
the battery life is very good i got about minutes with the lcd turned on all the time the first time around and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then and have yet needed to recharge it	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
this camera is ideal for people who want more power but do nt want to spend s dollars on a camera	1
with nikon although picture qualities are as good as any other mp cameras i ve had the following headaches	1
but overall this is a good camera with a really good picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability	1
otherwise it takes very good pictures shutter delay is nt so bad either	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the movie mode is also working great	1
the comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win without problem battery charger usb and video cable	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
even at the normal setting a x print shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a digital	1
the battery life is ok but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
i love all of the features and presets as well	1
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning and the evening	1
the software you get with this camera is perfect	1
touchups redeye and so on are very easy to alter and correct	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
great camera great investment	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use if you read the manual	1
downloads are a snap and quick	1
controls easy yo use and easy to get to	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
really happy with this little camera	1
it is nt big and offensive though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes	1
settings for just about everything beautiful pics and beautiful prints	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
still at least from my perspective a great camera for the money and i m a happy camper	1
this is a wonderful camera	1
mp gives you room for the future gaining experience cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera x optical and the fact that it carries nikon is quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price	1
one neat thing i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms no problem for the camera rooms looked like they had ample lighting	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over of all photos taken by a beginner	1
just point and shoot and the photos were great	1
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla	1
if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one	1
great camera i have been using this for several months and got excellent results simple friendly usage in many scenes indoor outdoor snow close up macro etc	1
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
battery life is ok	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
the quality is superb	1
the small size is perfect for my little hands but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping	1
they take excellent macro shots as well	1
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access and it takes silent movies	1
i compared this to a lot of other cameras believe me it is value for money	1
the picturers are amazing	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
i particularly like the txt file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories as always	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken	1
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
great camera	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
it takes great pictures	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down	1
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all	1
i have not been disappointed with my purchase	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
i am extremely satisfied with this camera	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
seriously i love it	1
but this camera is great	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
it is light weight enough to take with you everywhere but powerful enough to get outstanding pix	1
i love the continuous shot mode which allows you to take up to pix in rapid succession great for action shots	1
i m amazed at the photo quality prints are indistinguishable from mm prints	1
it has all the features an amatuer photo enthusiast would want	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they re still easy to use	1
the nikon coolpix line is a well established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model	1
picture quality is excellent	1
battery life is excellent	1
x built in optical zoom is a lot for this price range	1
great price for all the features	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the auto mode is good enough for most shots but the also boasts versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have nt played with it too much on manual	1
it is size also makes it ideal for travel	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
the same mp chip from the camera plus a x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders great closeup mode long lasting rechargable battery etc etc	1
in my opinion it is the best camera for the money if you re looking for something that is easy to use small good for travel and provides excellent sharp images	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
my favorite features although there are many are the speaker phone the radio and the infrared	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
in all fairness customer reps are very nice and they try hard to answer your questions	1
t mobile is trying very hard and again they do have pretty good csr is	1
i m staying with sprint and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as t mobile is the clarity of their reception is exceptional	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
no other color phone has the combination of features that the offers	1
from the speakerphone that can be used up to feet away with clarity to the downloadable poly graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned	1
it has a nice color screen	1
it is small	1
t mobile was a pretty good server	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone unlike the nokia and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make	1
this phone is a winner	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
as said before this works perfectly	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone is radio should work perfectly	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception	1
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone the is sold in almost everywhere in the world	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket	1
the battery life on this phone is surreal	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
overall i highly recommend this phone	1
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
nice little phone light compact	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
light compact design	1
solid high quality construction	1
well backlit keypad	1
outstanding signal reception	1
excellent sound quality	1
bright visible screen	1

the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception	1
the loud speaker function on the is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk	1
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets	1
overall this is a slightly better than average phone	1
this is the best phone i have seen	1
the phones are awesome	1
we hardly ever have to charge them get great reception and the customization and applications are awesome	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
the phone is sound quality is great i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1

for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1

first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
the battery life is amazing	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
i highly recommend this phone to anyone	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
i simply love this feature	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport	1

nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1

this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range or like me do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones	1
month no problems great phone i m very pleased with my phone	1
yes the features are numerous	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better	1
the radio feature has superb sound quality	1
it has a classic design yet looks hip	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
battery life is good for a phone of this size	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
great screen and great sound	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
the voice quality is very good and it gets great reception	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
other than that this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips	1
the nokia is a relatively new phone and what a great phone it is	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear piece which is included	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
the phone also sports an image gallery a calendar organizer alarm clock with snooze fm radio games java applications and gprs high speed internet connection	1
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved	1
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
nokia makes a great phone that is clear	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
it is crystal clear	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
affordable price reliable item and excellent customer service	1
i did have problem connecting my laptop to the internet but there customer service representative was very helpful and patient in walking me through all the steps	1
i am above average with technical knowledge but it is easy enough for the beginner to set up	1
our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
have nt setup any advanced features but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what i had with old router	1
it works good customer service lrb so far rrb stars	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
from the belkin my reception increased over	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
with the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch	1
setup was very easy	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
the model is also very clean and nice and the software is very user friendly	1
these were only my first week impressions but until now i strongly recommend this product and i m very satisfied with it	1
the d link has a ton of features including usb printer sharing two wireless networks lrb one not connected to the lan rrb and a really comprehensive settings menu	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
piece of cake to set up	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the set up went fairly smooth with netgears online knowledge base	1
i verified the signal strengths with a laptop and there was no problem there	1
the set up was pretty simple basically a matter of hooking everything up and rebooting your system at which time you re taken to the d link website to finalize how your setup will be	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
as of this review i am using the router and it is working very nicely	1
as a final comment i am happy with the d link dir so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether i m using my asus netbook or apple ipad	1
installation was easy as advertised	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
amazing speed and easy to set up	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
the set up for this product was a breeze	1
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
my xboxs ipod iphone ipad are all catching a nice strong signal	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
set up was smooth and both wired and wireless devices worked very well on it	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
no problems with any of those connections	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
i am a novice at this stuff but it was extremely easy to set the router up	1
so far the router has worked well	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
you should use the firmware on the dd wrt website instead	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
i thought it might possibly be the modem or isp until i hooked the old trusty linksys back up to it and it worked fine	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
worked fine after that	1
i have very high praise for the tech support people	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
i tried setting the router up with the laptop and it connected easily and hooked me up to the internet in under minutes	1
when i then moved the wire to the desktop and used the laptop wirelessly the internet connection was just fine	1
this is an outstanding product one that lives up to the pr	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
worked fine	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
however the setup was easy and the results excellent	1
i have been dealing with wireless routers and access points for a long time lrb most recently with cisco linksys rrb and this was the easiest most efficient setup i ve ever experienced	1
and it works great too	1
this device solves the problem nicely	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
this router works fine and i am able to stream video in all rooms of the house at the same time	1
this router works very well right out of the box	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
this router is phenomenal	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the router has port gig ethernet switch and wireless access point ap rrb n working flawlessly	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
it was nice to have the faster internal network speeds while we tested this router lrb which was for all of about hours while trying to get everything to work properly rrb	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
the dir was so easy to setup it was almost too easy	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
we still have our other network which i use with my ipod however i will change it soon because the cisco valet is much better and faster	1
i m delighted with this product	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
easy set up	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
great coverage	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
this is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
reliable highly available and ease of administration and forget about me lrb do nt bother anymore rrb equipment	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
set up went pretty well and things seemed good	1
it is a wonderful little router	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
setup was easy lrb windows xp wired windows professional wifi rrb	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
i m very happy with this router and would recommend it	1
update i ve been using this router for months and it is still working very well wifi remains strong and consistant	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
this is a good product	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
good range speed	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
it came well packaged	1
it is a really nice looking device and can be positioned horizontally or vertically	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
and it is sleek and sexy looking as well	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
i didnt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and im glad i purchased these speakers	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
sound quality is good	1
tuner quality is good	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
yes the buttons are a bit small and close but they are functional	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
i took them to a different room and tested them with my mp player where they worked fine and sounded pretty good	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
thats pretty much it the speakers rock the control station and remote are nifty and the sub is powerful	1
great speakers overall	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
these a great speakers full of sound	1
the bass is solid and can be quite impressive if turned up	1
the speakers look nice and are easy to use	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
if you re okay with removing the skin each time you want to use the speaker system then by all means purchase these speakers as they are great	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
the comparable product in quality is the old style shelf speaker popular in the is called the brick but this unit does not have the weight of that product	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
an excellent product with excellent and typically superb logitech production values	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the sound quality is really good	1
the size is small	1
the way i have to put in my i pod was a little tricky but when it was done the speakers sound really good	1
the satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean	1
the speaker arived in excellent condition	1
the build quality is top notch	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
the sound was crisp clear and no distortion	1
the speaker bar response was spot on	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
for those of you looking for excellent sound reproduction expecially during a raging decepticon battle look no further	1
this pinnacle speaker bar is well worth the money	1
it also has a year warranty which is just icing on the cake	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
sound quality is great bass quality is beyond good	1
build quality is great	1
still for the price you ca nt find better for the cost	1
this audio bar has a great sound even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
they were easy to install and ended up using feet of cable	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
i highly recomend theese speakers	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
assembly of the stands is very straightforward and well detailed in the instructions	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
i have no problem at all recommending these stands	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
good quality for a small portable speaker	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
its tiny and has really decent sound for something so small	1
the rechargeable battery is a great feature	1
very good value for the money	1
i love this little speaker	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
there are no incompatibility problems and they work fine	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
this portable speaker is easy to use powerful enough for everyday use and available at a pretty decent price	1
the battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good lrb not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer rrb	1
awesome sound system	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
it was easy to install all of the components and directions were easy to understand even for an old guy like me	1
this set is not my preferred to use in my car lrb i use the jbl on tour great sound for a small compact speaker rrb but i was very impressed with the phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house	1
for the price the sound is great and their portability lrb pack down to a large egg shape rrb is quite good	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
the soft orange glow at the base is a nice nightlight	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
it is loud and the quality is good	1
a product and very well built for apple users in mind oh yeah theres a usb port in the back for you droid people	1
the sound is great not as good as my each klipsch r s but come on for the size and price you will not beat these units	1
well i can not complain about the volume bass or mounting abilities of the system	1
these insten folding speakers are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
here are my observations pros folding these have a very clever design that allows them to fold in to a small cube for easy transporting good sound produces fairly good sound at all but the highest volume levels lrb see cons below rrb at least to my untrained ear universal connector the unit uses a standard mini connector so this can be used with all of mp players power options comes with a usb power cable or it can use x aaa batteries	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
i was looking for an inexpensive room suited ipod speaker and this is what i got	1
it works fine without the dock but it is shaky and unstable	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
easy set up and the picture was crystal clear	1
love this speaker	1
sounds awesome	1
works super easy	1
looks great	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
i have found this little device to be quite fun to use	1
the range seems quite good even through walls	1
i mainly use it with my apple ipad and it really sounds quite good for it diminutive size	1
the range is great i can list to my radio anywhere in the house	1
logitech is n speaker lapdesk wins in the area of comfort	1
the padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience	1
the speakers themselves sound really good	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
the speakers are pretty small so they wo nt take up a lot of space but they play as loud as you want them to and they have great quality	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
this product is amazing	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
if you are concerned about looks get these	1
best ht upgrade i ve made in over years	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
dialogue is very noticeably clearer	1
sound effects really sound more authentic	1
the second set is working just fine	1
you can fill a small room with sound pretty good but do nt think it rivals a home theater system	1
music sounds great but having surround sound in game is nice and a big difference from headphones	1
these speakers are a greatg value i use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
in addition the price point is spectacular	1
these are the only computer speakers i ve ever bought so i have no comparison to anything else	1
this system is very powerful	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
this is the best sound system i have ever heard	1
the woofer is much larger	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
pros great sound for a speaker at mid to higher levels	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
input and headphone on right jack is super handy	1
power volume and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy	1
if you want loud boomy bass this does the job very well for a computer speaker lrb no these are nt going to hit as hard as larger power guzzling woofers but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers i ve heard rrb	1
this is a preference but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels i d be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less redolent of a teenager is car system	1
sub woofer is large	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
i love this speakers	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
this tiny speakers produce really big sound	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
i set it up in my living room and the sound was superb	1
this is a superb system and highly recommended	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
however because this dock plays about any mp player and is of good quality and low price it should sell very well	1
these are good looking durable speaker stands	1
overall they are great stands and look good	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the ihome however has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
obviously one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
the highs and lows sound great and personally i think the bass is at a perfect level lrb at rrb definitely not boomy	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
i believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your desktop computer or laptop i try this at bestbuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker now when i got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok i have a mac and i wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it is a nightmare to find a fully compatible pci card i found a great plug in for mac i tunes srs iwow after installing the demo i was totally impress by the quality of sound just a great alternative for mac users	1
my brother and i were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is	1
the sound became instantly clear again	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
this is the best speaker mount i had so far	1
this speaker mount is suitable for small speaker	1
volume level is ok	1
jbl s ii is truly amazing	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the center channel is jbl s center ii this unit is very powerful and produces crystal clear dialogues and it is a way speaker system	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
p i am very happy about my investment and the quality service of amazon and j r store	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
i highly recommend this device	1
far surpasses anything i ve heard to date for their superior sound	1
apart from being very easy to install and the excellent music quality what i really find fascinating is discovering new artists with internet radio stations or music providers	1
they sound wonderful the only issue is where to put them when i move around	1
these speakers are great	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
the satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
tiny	1
portable	1
great sound	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
pros great sound sleek cool look compact comes with rca adapter speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted cons mainly for pc only lrb but works fairly well with tv is rrb wattage is nt all that high no immediate line in lrb so you ca nt hook your mp player up and get srs right out of the box rrb i ve heard a bunch of people say that the cord is for the rear speakers are nt long enough	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
the audio cube is great	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
it works great for this purpose	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
this setup worked perfectly the first shot at it	1
i did not even have to hit the auto tune button it just worked instantly	1
if you want background music better than your tv sound for movies speakers around the house for parties outside get togethers this is about as good as you can expect for the price	1
works great	1
easy to pair	1
great sound	1
good battery life	1
life is good	1
good price	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
i absolutely love these speakers	1
lrb all that being said the speakers have good sound quality	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
once i turn up the volume a touch they sound really good	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger now blue backlit screen which is infinitely better	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it	1
the software is great	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
even the battery life is great it advertises hours it is actually a little less but still good	1
they player is interface itself is also very easy to use	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
i ve had it for a week now do nt regret the purchase one bit and i never leave home without it	1
software is easy to use	1
much cheaper than i pod good looking player if you ve read about the player some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on but this is good because the face does nt get damaged scratched fast transfer rate	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
the battery is replaceable and there is a leather case	1
so far the software for the pc works easily	1
by the way it looks nice also	1
it is worth it	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
the included leather pouch is a big plus it actually protects the unit well something a lot of carrying cases fail to do with other audio devices	1
other plusses changable battery loads of presets for environments decent construction still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
the music is easy to get to and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
it is a very intuitive program	1
i had no problems following their installation instructions	1
the menus are very easy to navigate	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
it has several play options one of the best is an option to shuffle based on all or a certain playlist	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
when it came down to it the price on this player is hard to beat	1
other than that this thing is great	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
for some this might be a problem but for the price of a gig ipod you can get a gb nomad the ipod simply pales in comparison	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
the free carrying case is really protective and to me its the only accessory you need	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking by artist song title genre etc	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
very sleek stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has	1
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
the sound quality is also nice after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
another plus in my book no file limits	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player	1
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
getting files onto it is quick and painless	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems	1
the battery is nice	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
sound quality was the same between the two but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features	1
i love this player	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
i still have over gb left and already have over cd is on it	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
ripping transferring tunes is basic and pretty fast	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
the setup and transfer process was cake for me	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
all in all though i m very happy with my new mp player	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable	1
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra it is that good	1
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior	1
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight	1
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use playback quality and value for the price	1
just bought one i ve enjoyed it to date	1
nice palm sized unit somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you re not going to try jog with it or something	1
all reviews i ve seen seem to indicate that the creative mp jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these nd generation jukeboxed	1
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
best in class sound	1
large easy readable screen	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i love it	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
it is great sounding even with the supplied earbuds	1
i must have differing preferences than others here as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony is that i thought sounded good on other players	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
the player is software is very easy to use and very good	1
compared to musicmatch the software has a better filing system and easier to use	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
this thing seriously is a good player though	1
overall i like the unit	1
price gb of storage	1
storage capacity	1
user replaceable battery	1
overall i like it	1
the storage capacity is great	1
the price compared to the ipod is great	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
i ve had no problems with the software	1
i found it intuitive to use	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the nomad is not ugly it is not that big it comfortably fits in my pocket or heavy and the controls are not hard to get used to	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
i just bought this player today and i already love it	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
overall this player is awesome and i definately recommend it	1
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
compared to other leading hdd mp players the value per gb is the tops	1
sound quality excellent everything you would expect from this company	1
the unit is easy to use and intuitive	1
uploading music is quick and easy	1
although the supplied software can be annoying at times on whole it is excellent	1
the unit itself its well structured with just the buttons you need and none you do nt	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
also the nomad is hours of battery life versus is handy	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player	1
i have the software working fine now and the mp player is fantastic	1
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp player is worth the money it cost	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod however it compromises a bit of the unit is size in doing so	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
the signal to noise ratio is nice and high at decibles and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
lastly the price is fantastic	1
i uploaded the drivers and new software in minutes no crashes or problems	1
usb very fast	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
the scroll button seems ok i have no problems with it	1
i am very pleased so far	1
very simple to use	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
overall i feel that it is a decent buy and am happy that i own it	1
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows k machine	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
i have nt messed with the firmware at all the player worked perfect for me right out of the box	1
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
many people have written about the software being its one downfall personally i have nt had a single problem with the software i m running windows me	1
the cd ripping to mp is so easy and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp player so it wo nt take up space on your pc hard drive	1
the software runs smooth it is nice to look at it is very organized easy to follow and makes things very simple	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
the player is fast and sounds great it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music or making it sound like you re hearing the music in a huge auditorium	1
the battery lasts very long when playing music but writing files to the player drains the battery fast so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
the software could nt be better and the mp player works like a dream i could nt give this anything but a i wish there was a	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket	1
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp player	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
it hasnt gone below the second notch so the battery life seems fine	1
oh and file transfers are fast easy	1
it is easy	1
the buttons are easy to use and its easy to navigate	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
its really cool	1
sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse but its really good	1
you can also slow a song down speed it up which is cool too	1
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product	1
a lot of people complain about the creative software but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources you can t do this on the ipod	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player	1
third creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player	1
it also lets you remove songs from the play order	1
if you bring up an album but absolutely hate some of the tracks the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly	1
extremely convenient	1
great price	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
i m really happy with this purchase	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and ive heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything	1
ive seen em all the archos dell ipods everything good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion	1
price and capacity	1
slick looking design and improved interface	1
removable battery	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
file transfers are fast nearly a song per second via usb	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs my entire collection of cd is will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
it is really a shame because otherwise creative mp players are very good and have the best sound quality of any players on the market	1
after some consideration i chose the gb nomad zen xtra from creative and i have not been disappointed	1
first the battery is replacable by the user because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could nt be easier to use	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
i thought i d have to buy a set of headphones to use with it but the included earbuds work quite well	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more	1
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation a slightly audible click if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do nt even notice the click	1
m u files are used by most mp players like musicmatch and winamp but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists it does nt care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray	1
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
the memory is staggering	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
screen was good easy to read	1
sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great	1
i decided to save the and opted for the zen xtra and i was not disappointed	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it is easy to use and effective	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
the price performance looked just right	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
great sound and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
the player works well with my sony srs a powered speakers	1
the player user interface is intuitive to use and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection	1
the nomad explorer works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player	1
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by rd party programs like notmad	1
usb means fast data transfers	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about feet from my desk as well as have played it outdoors in fahrenheit weather and it has continued to work fine	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
wake up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
big storage my entire cd collection in one small device	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
also love waking up to music with attached speakers	1
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i m not too keen on www ipodsdirtysecret com	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
i loved this product when i first got it great sound easy to use and held enough songs to suit any mood	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
sound quality on this is amazing as with all creative products	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
the menu allows you to search for files by artist genre and album quite easily	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
my first impression was positive	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
sure this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
i bought the player this week and i like it by far	1
removable and cheap battery a li battery usually works properly for years	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
the appearance is okayed	1
the size is small	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
the display is awesome you can see everything you want and read it clearly	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
if you use software correctly put in all the id tags you will get an awesome database collection from which you can easily access your songs	1
i dont know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
battery recharge is an awesome thing because it recharges in only like hours	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
there is an alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
there is a clock and date which can get helpful	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
the music plays awesome never skips even if u run for a bit so you can listen to music without interruption	1
and also it is priced very affordably	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair is notmad software because of some advanced features i wanted	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
accessing files by artist and album is easy and intuitive	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
since batteries do run out on everything this will also be a big money saver since ipods irivers rca dell all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician	1
try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
price	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod is as well in that you do nt risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you re there	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
interface practically seamless	1
yet after ensuring that all the id tags are in order it actually turns out to be really handy	1
playlists can be generated on the fly or by using the software and there are a bevy of eq options	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
it is easy to transfer preview and organize files	1
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
it was no problem for me to use their software	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
honestly i love this player	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the sound quality is very good	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
