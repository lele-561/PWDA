main dial is not backlit	0
lens visible in optical viewfinder	0
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle but since i use the lcd most of the time this is not really much of a bother to me	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
not very ergonomical you ll find even for a point and shoot lens	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens	0
the lens cover is surely loose i already accidently finger printed the len a few times and au lens tigt and cause potential damage	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
it was too expensive for the shots that i got	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust	0
the grain was terrible	0
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash	0
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr the internal flash on the g produces harsh flat images with ugly hot spots	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
what the g raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical	0
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
got way too many blurry pictures	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
it feels slow to focus and unbearably slow to shoot	0
unfortunately this digital moment capturing device called the g sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted	0
the included lens cap is very loose on the camera	0
the body construction buttons casing etc are too plastic	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder but does not detract from the image at all	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
there is no tiff format	0
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
the included memory card is too small	0
it is made of plastic	0
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot	0
while light it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets	0
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews yes the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0
when you look through the viewfinder the bottom left corner of the picture is blocked by the lens	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
display glitches and flashes also occurred	0
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
the only reason i did nt give it stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak but that is really to be expected is nt it	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
my comments are as follow does nt have direct elictrical connectivity lrb you need adapter which is comming with the package rrb it is really very difficult to connect the the power cable the regular lrb vga rrb pc connection	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
this means that the vga connection will not work with my computers	0
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
do nt buy this monitor	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
i felt the system was slow so i purchased a gb ram from crucell and replaced the standard gb that came with the system	0
someday your going to need support and acer is technical support department is the next to worthless	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
third gripe these monitors can suffer from the lcd equivalent of screen burn image persistence if you like	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
i find it too bright	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
weeks later the monitor start having other issues only half screen turns on or it become a full green screen and doesnt change you need to turn it off and on again until it works	0
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
it is flimsy plastic and the monitor bounces around while you type	0
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
there is one very annoying problem with this model though the keyboard is sticky meaning despite this tablet is brand new and just arrived when i press and release a key on the keyboard it acts as if i kept it pressed continuing to type the same character again and again	0
the stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor	0
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
maybe some of you do nt have this problem but i know of over cases of buzzing from this monitor	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
you guys need to hire new repair technicians because the ones that are in the repair center obviously have no idea what they are doing	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
however when you unplug the computer it beeps	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
the only negative thing about this was the instructions for adjusting the display were not very clear and it took a little time to figure out how to do it	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
i would not recommend this or any acer product to anyone except perhaps my ex	0
expensive but for us well worth it	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
this product did not work at all	0
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
for my work this panel is unusable	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the problems came from my video card	0
their products are super expensive especially to get them fixed	0
i hesitated for so long because of the price	0
my only grips are the incompatibility with xp and the usb hub in the display	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
i know the saying is you get what you pay for but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this there is no excuse	0
will never purchase apex again	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
apex does nt answer the phone	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
very bad quality	0
died very shortly after getting them	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas	0
the door would not close	0
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
have had problems since the first day	0
not playing some dvds and then finally after less than days it just would not recognize anything i pop in it	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with canned air	0
the remote is okay but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons	0
i especially like the more commonly used buttons such as play pause and stop to be larger and conveniently placed	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
i bought of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work	0
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that months ago is no longer working	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
who knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out but it probably will	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
also a couple dvd is would nt play and they were new ones	0
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective	0
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
door broke after a month	0
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
as an engineer i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale	0
only used for month before it is down	0
it sends discoutinous signals to tv so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment	0
the other thing i do nt like about this is that it makes the color look over saturated	0
the entire unit was poorly crafted	0
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
the dvd player just wouldt recognize them	0
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
now i know why they are pieces of junk	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
mine was weeks old and i chucked it in the trash where it belongs	0
each of the lasted less than six months	0
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
one bad thing though i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably die before the player does	0
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
the first one would nt work from the start	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working	0
there was neither picture nor sound	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
neither message was answered	0
it only read the dvds of the time otherwise i would get a no disc screen	0
i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
and the remote is cheap and cheasy not sure how long it ll last but for bucks what the heck	0
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
i ve tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered	0
it has never worked	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
purchased the ad about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it	0
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on off button	0
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
i ve sent e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
way through the first disk we played on it the dvd player froze	0
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk	0
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
have tried calling but can t get through	0
this product sucks the customer service from apex sucks	0
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
i can only hear the sound but no picture	0
their customer service is very poor	0
one of the dvd is i received as a christmas present kept freezing	0
some dvd is i rented would not play	0
when the player was working it was great but	0
first of all i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
for example i tried playing my new pirates of the carribean extra features dvd but this dvd player can not read it	0
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my alias dvds as well	0
because of this i am disappointed and would not recommend this product	0
after two weeks the picture kept freezing	0
apex sucks	0
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
the catch is that while it plays movies just fine it has refused to read second discs with the movie extras on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
video output stopped workin	0
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
what a disappointment	0
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
output went black and white only via both s video and composite connections and with no v hold	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
well within days the video output quit working	0
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
update january th the second one crapped out only after a week dont buy this product	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
only one disk played through to completion successfully	0
when we tried to hook up the first one it was broken the motor would not eject discs or close the door	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
imagine my shock and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex	0
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close a very annoying thing after ahwile	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex	0
one still works fine the other quit after one day	0
apex is website is down and they wo nt answer their phone	0
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that is inserted maybe seconds of wait	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
first the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds	0
this is extemely lame	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
after less than hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment for myself and for my parents for whom it was a gift	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed	0
all in all trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance	0
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
the build quality shows why its so cheap small scratches on the base plate something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel	0
remote buttons are small and closely spaced especially with the menu buttons	0
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc	0
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
on several different occasions it has displayed no disc with a disc inside	0
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand but with my experience and reading the other reviews i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product	0
the had false silver plate instead of play display	0
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
can t say whether i rec d an updated model but it will not read dvd rw is or vcd is for me	0
pictures wont transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
lens cap is a really annoying	0
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
i send my camera to nikon for servicing took them a whole weeks to diagnose the problem	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
made the camera totally inoperable	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
audio on video also lacking	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long especially if you use the flash a lot	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
the only drawbacks i ve encountered are indoor shots from a distance ft lack contrast and color but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr	0
the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
mb for a camera like this is a joke	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the mm wide angle wc e the optical viewfinder is partially obscured	0
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
i spent hours setting up the stations though the reception is unpredictable	0
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the volume	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i assumed they had exceptional service but their reception in my area is horrendous	0
also their t zones although cheap never works	0
since i received the phone i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t zones would work in hours	0
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of weeks when t zones never worked	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
however the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega static to the point where i d have to dial numbers times to get a clear line	0
the volume level of the phone is not all that good	0
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear but not easy to listen to	0
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times	0
the vibration is not top	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
they are not wowable good	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
negative impossibly tiny and difficult to operate barely visible power button	0
poor visibility on the keys	0
only con i can think of is no camera	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t mobile	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
key instead	0
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the vibrate setting is loud	0
so loud really that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
some features in the user interface	0
no voice activated dialing what were they thinking	0
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
no propietary headset jack	0
only if we could get one camera in it	0
the volume key can be hard to press but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call	0
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop	0
its quiet	0
i do here a constant high pitched distorted sound not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough	0
although i find it more convenient to use touch dialing this phone does not have voice dialing	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
one more thing the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
this model does have the traditional key arrangement it is just that they are really close to one another and have unconventional shapes so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands	0
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
unfortunately the does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming	0
one downside as of this writing t mobile has nt updated their t zone system to fully support the	0
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
however the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality	0
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
shareport is not compatible with mac os	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the router does nt support port translation e g forward port in the outside to port in the inside	0
nor there is a clear manual offered by the manufacturer or by qwest qwest does provide some info but nothing about what is not intuitive enough in the screen	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
when i bought the third one i thought i can give d link one more try but now i regret my decision	0
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
bottom line do nt buy this for the usb function	0
addition on i ve just had the nd router of this model go bad inside of months	0
last night i needed to reset the router	0
i unplugged it plugged it back in and the power supply failed	0
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the network was down the internet connection was gone and the router was completely unresponsive	0
after that the router would never even respond to its own internal browser link	0
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
the customer support is very rude	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
it worked reasonably well for a while although it frequently was barely able to keep up when i tried to stream movies which was a big part of the reason i went to a faster router in the first place	0
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
and finally in early june this router stopped broadcasting an internet signal	0
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
when i reset it like unplugging it and plugging it back in i would get the n speeds mbps the first time it connected and would transfer files at that speed then usually next time i connected it would drop back to or mbps and stay at these speeds	0
called their support they did nt have a clue so i returned it and i am looking for something else that will give me mbps	0
easy enough but it did not work	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
this router gets star from me due to it is disconnect issue	0
have the latest firmware but as many others have described the router will randomly stop working for minutes then work again	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
especially due to the odd sized plug designed by d link	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
unfortunately my verizon g signal strength where i live is very weak lrb bars rrb so i could nt get much more than mbps download speed but i will test this again when i am in a location with decent signal strength	0
only issue is with updating firmware	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
unfortunately i just could not get it to work	0
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
i conclude that the ethernet transceiver d link uses is not as good as that of other brands	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
they said the product was defective and said they would send a new one	0
i am disappointed in this product	0
in that regard i am still having difficulty attempting to get the shareport utility to function normally	0
more than likely if you are forking over the money for this router you have higher needs and expectations which this router does nt meet	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
this router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed iptv from hulu plus would slow down and freeze or stutter	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
i gave up after several attempts to contact dlink support	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
i guess i do nt have to mention that i do not recommend this product that i most likely will return it and keep my fingers off cisco linksys stuff in future	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the new router worked well for months after which it had failed	0
i am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
when the securespot free trial finishes they ask you to buy it and when you do nt it stops working well	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
d link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable	0
my linksys froze for minutes or longer when applying changes	0
first thing i tested was the speed and i have to say it was abysmal	0
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
i do nt think the external switch is much of a feature because in the end you have to learn how to identify ip addresses switch the router from from a dynamic to static ip address and assign a static ip address that is compatible with your router or modem	0
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
if i only considered the software or internet user manual i would have rated technical support as or maybe lrb at best rrb	0
i only give it stars because the device came with really old dd wrt software	0
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
the incoming call volume is incredibly low and it is often difficult to hear my customers lrb it was so bad i had my hearing tested because i thought something was wrong with me	0
i tried to use these with my laptop lrb dell inspiron rrb but could nt get rid of the buzzing noise others have mentioned no matter how far i moved them from the computer or where i plugged them in	0
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
one thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
that and for the center speaker when i mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward leaning out about and inch from the wall	0
they are a bit top heavy as any tower will be	0
they offered to replace my controller but important to note they were unwilling to cross ship it	0
the klipsh subwoofer is laughable	0
initially the sound was low and sounded off	0
the remote control and reciever not so good	0
the buttons are confusing and super small	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
the range of response seems a little limited to me lrb changing the eq setting on the ipod produces a definite change in the sound but i would expect a little more richness in the changes rrb	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
you can also use a v dc power supply lrb not included rrb cons bad instructions like many products of this type the instructions manual is lacking and in this case erroneously lists the power requirements as ac when it should be dc	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
the only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side but still is very good and you can set your equalizer to make up for it	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
the switch being in the back is a little awkward as the other reviews also mention and the pulse is nt really all that but that is irrelevant to me	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
if you want good sound stay away	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
some may not like the horn tweeters as they tend to sound too hot	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
construction all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last	0
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
the speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out they clip the audio	0
i have nt even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over	0
assembly is a little awkward because the drawings are nt that great	0
first of all i disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
i deducted a star because when i put my ipod and ipad on full volume the speaker is bass began to completely ruin the sound	0
there are a few things that i do nt like about the design	0
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
although i was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look but it really works	0
the sound is far from good and there is a lot of interference mainly when doing any wifi activity	0
material is on the cheap side	0
the controls are hard to see and not intuitive	0
the sound quality is very poor	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
only problem no accessories yet	0
i hope it is because it is new and they are not out yet but being without a remote is hard	0
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well	0
it could be a little bit bigger but it is easy to get used to	0
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
the only downside i see is that it does nt look like you can manage playlists from the nomad it has to be done from the computer	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the face plate which pops out for the battery pops open by itself every minutes or so	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating	0
overall a very disappointing product	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience	0
also the instruction manual is very bad	0
transfering i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb or	0
it would only transfer or so songs and then come up with an error	0
scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling	0
size bigger than the ipod	0
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once but it has nt done it since	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
the cons are nt really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it is based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did nt have any that might be the same as another	0
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
my fast forward button works but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go	0
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
unlike my other mp players this thing will only work properly if you have id tags on all of your tracks	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was nt a big problem	0
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well	0
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do nt figure out a way to break it	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical	0
included creative software is pretty poor	0
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
had there been strange noises or obvious defects i would have accepted a replacement but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches	0
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
the software is somewhat nice to look at using it is not the easiest	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
this is ridiculous	0
the scroll wheel to be blunt sucks	0
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
and the case how did this ever make it out of quality control	0
it is some protection for the unit but for useability forget it	0
the cut outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls especially the scroll wheel	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
the scroll button is nt the best as it sometimes can be hard to select	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
fragile	0
scroll button switch	0
the case hides the display you have to open it to see what you are doing	0
but for now it appears that this player does nt play well with itunes	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
you even can not navigate by genre artist album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre no other division	0
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
this thing is trash	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
the screen is hard to read the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display	0
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up doesnt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
software downloads on the site crashed my pc	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for hours and they did not help at all	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap replace them	0
a spare battery would have been great	0
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer like some players	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
fm receiver it has none	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
the player feels very delicate as if i m holding an actual hard drive	0
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
the songs do nt play one after another like on a cd	0
software the software is crap	0
otherwise it is difficult to figure out and awkward	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
no line out jack as i said there is none	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
controls are a bit awkward	0
it was nt as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman	0
crappy headphones	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
it is a bit cumbersome and i can t get to the songs i want as quickly	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
up down left and right would have given me better control	0
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo nt stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
but the major problem i had was with the software	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused	0
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with bass boost	0
well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it it will be a breeze	0
my only complaint would be that you need id tags that takes a while to do if your mp files do nt have them	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
but the earbuds suck	0
i forgot the case does nt fit	0
my case doesnt close maybe mine was just faulty but the case isnt that great	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made	0
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks	0
the dynamic playlists feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are nt as easy as the ipod is or as sexy looking	0
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away	0
the front cover feels flimsy but when snapped on the device still feels pretty solid	0
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh not a big deal	0
it is slightly larger than an ipod no doubt about it	0
i would have liked to have given it stars docking that star only for the size	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
it also has unproven battery life	0
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models	0
eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp files	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
the only two things that stop me from giving it stars are the ho hum software that comes with the system and the traveling case it comes with	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
mediasource did not recognize my tags	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
the zen does not have a stop button	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic but usb recharging would be a convenient choice	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason	0
the software that came with it was tough to load	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the top did not fit well into the unit	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was nt in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage	0
this did not feel like quality construction and i was nt sure how long it would last	0
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen the front panel refused to clip in correctly leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
in fact i d have to rate it among the worst i ve ever encountered	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
it took several days of attempts before things finally worked again and i have nt a clue why	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
folders cannot be created for the audio files	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative is marketing	0
the case occludes the display screen when it is closed	0
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
so i ve had it for a month and the headphone jack went out	0
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
it is kinda heavy kinda like having a walkman	0
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
the software sucks	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
i am annoyed that the player is not automatically recognized as a hard drive	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped	0
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player but not the folder name	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
the general button placement is not very user friendly	0
third the poor design continues with the case	0
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of	0
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
battery life is about of that advertised no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players occasional software lockups replacement battery is expensive	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does nt work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem	0
the zen does nt support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders documents and programs can t be launched from the zen so it is not a hard disk it is a storage device at best	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
the catch is it is built like a piece of crap	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with in this player is the battery life	0
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said	0
you need the software to actually transfer files	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway	0
creative software stinks	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
short warranty occasional freeze up somewhat flimsy navigation wheel	0
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face that sometimes comes off a bit easily but besides that it is perfect	0
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance	0
do nt buy this player	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
do nt buy this player	0
do not buy this product	0
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy day warranty ended	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
what a junk	0
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use and there are some oddities about the software tagging system but most people can live with this	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
i m convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed and will not hold up to normal use	0
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover which is taken off to have access to the battery seemed to come undone very easily	0
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
