battery life	0
the ability to connect to the router is a nice when backing up from my various computers	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
in addition it only seems to if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
the screen is too easily scratched	0
my complaint that the cord is not long enough	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work t mobile is services they deleted the menu options that would enable you to the to be used on a different network	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are so easily concealed	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you everything configured	1
it also has excellent coverage our two story house	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
build quality is top notch	1
sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
i do nt think really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
the size is small	1
the labeling of firmware itself mystery and suggests that this company is just	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
with mediasource being so easy i no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
price gb of storage	1
optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot features and add on options comes with great software and last by far not least received my is stamp of approval	1
my gripe is which worse than other cheaper apex units	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it a little bit	1
dead on mine	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual the hard nor the cd version	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
software which comes with player not good all	0
after using it for just a month i could not play	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has	1
came back working and i was momentarily that i d heard about acer tech support did turn out be true in my case	1
great price	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
anytime we changes to the router we had manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
it would spin more and then show that there was no disc	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill for such a small speaker system	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
excellent range of metering options well	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
the sound quality is very good	1
it a phone if you are all over the world packed with	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a bang for the buck	1
the end of the day what wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
but then again the ringer can be that i heard ringing inside my office when i already out on the street	1
are the sound people for computers can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
the setup process for the nomad is and the interface with the player sub par	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the problem with this box is it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds i bought the zen and guess what	0
great quality and features	1
i was looking forward to it if all the other already said it was slow	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features are comparable to even the ipod	1
picture quality is excellent	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen the image still looked normal	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
i using jbl n ii as surround left right which is a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the is not good either and the driver trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
battery life is ok	1
contrary to what ive g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated from canon	1
video output stopped workin	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
is the best phone i have seen	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
the main reason i am not satisfied with this product the fact that will lock up at odd times	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1

thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1

i tried called apex cust service help	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
overall i like it	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items in great shape	1
i immediately problems getting to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
the system was near stable and the code was alpha stage at best	1
the aff feature did a great job the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone break easily like typical american phones	0
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
the g has a different type from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging also enables you to use the camera plugged without running down battery	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
fm receiver it has none	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
customer support website is useless	0
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
all all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
price	1
if you re looking for a small compact camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it turning it by feel alone	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt with mp s the list goes on and on	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0

because it can help a so photographer take spectacular photos	1
to lot of has mentioned about	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
flash photos are never great and there was still lot of noise	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass obviously not thumping bass for which would need a huge subwoofer	1
first all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
it played only one of three is without problems the other two by a number of glitches	0
it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1

i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is ruining my media	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is because these are computer speakers	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m but i was able to figure out most of just messing around with it at a camera store	1
i have it for a now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming matter how you tweak the levels	0
way less expensive than the	1

i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own are two different things that should be at the measures get the better sound quality i do nt complain for fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot people	1
so far i have and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
performs well but love having the optional scene modes they are and correspond to many situations in which i would actually to use the camera	1

they caused the ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
the interface used be better designed	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the us and mortar they both delivered great results	1
my issue with the mediasource software is that pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
the appearance is okayed	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and and the battery duration is amazing	1

sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
excellent polyphonic ringing tones very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
delivery was prompt	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love	1
volume level is ok	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0

the price is good	1
this router is awesom but it only support xbox we have and you can never get more than have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1

for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1

it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1

the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and other programs	0
d link does provide mac support however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1

as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the buttons and interface	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
what really made this for me was the software	1
setup was very easy	1
for instance i made several back ups my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays dvds	1
i love this player	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy use a sophisticated flash unit	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0

it has never worked	0
i a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
it slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
these speakers are great	1

i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
navigation could be better but is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable it	0
be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you one of the sub menu items and that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0

i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1

anything this phone does it perfectly	1
recent price drops made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
also i can t understand why the does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
my first impression was positive	1

full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
also feature to automatically put in is nt always	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the collection on the computer	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were wap pages available	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
having makes for very fast transfers	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected and do nt to wait rrb and got least my imac and macbook back online	1

find all well placed and not flimsy the least	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the possibilities with auto manual the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings portrait landscape beach sunset etc are	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx player a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system categorizes based on i d tags and excellent sound	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
it is clear	1
the monitor works with a sharp and bright display	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
the battery	1

the battery is alot better than of out there	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the premium is good lrb do nt and user friendly	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put into the g	1
device itself is pretty solid	1
for those of us that i think creative offers some advantages	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes downloading graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
games kind stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable albeit one on which can create folders or at worst a very lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
easy to hook up	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
navigation could be better but there is nt anything the zen xtra can t do once you gotten comfortable with it	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
what a disappointment	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in or on a train	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
color screen is good	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
seriously i love it	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
is okay but the eax can cause audio interference	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in while prompting a reset	0
the larger lens of g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets just much	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a mm headset jack	0
in short you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is for you	0
transfer through windows explorer recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1

avoid this like the plague	0
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
in addition it with a remote control	1
for the cost of product i could not ask for more	1

the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and worked for the last couple to few months i had it	0
considering the price and specs this might the best there for a large memory mp player	1
customer service and technical are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about quality of their products and their to stand behind them	0
please a firmware upgrade that enables all usb drives attached to this wireless router to the actual local computer desktop portals and be to drop upload attach etc	1
i using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
selected it it looked easy to install	1
can t beat carrying collection with me i go	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
the replacement unit a problem on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
my wife is even more pleased due its widescreen	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
great speakers overall	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1

at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel it	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of kids playing with sparklers	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour to get this monstrosity to in its cage	0
i think the real reason made the changes that it now uses gpu hardware	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
while i would of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
i did nt think i would find quality and ease of use for under i	0
it does in all aspects of internet browsing	1
ring tones only with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0

the price performance looked just right	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and satisfied the range of have there too	1
loved the slim design	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
i am very pleased with it so far	1

i looking portability and good battery life and delivers both	1

these monitors are great for the price	1

then sorting the files is	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make of a disturbance	1
easy enough to navigate through although i prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	0
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
i really love this netbook	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
well within days the video output quit working	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
having unfilled id tags cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
it is extremely light dissapears in your pocket	1
i highly recommend it	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
i thought it just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for price	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
audio is excellent	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i m still very frustrated with some the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i open up my sound card is control panel every time i between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that do nt know of rrb	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
after years with that carrier expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is what i can do with it	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
the setup process for the nomad and the interface with the player is sub par	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked and will not do anything now	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
comparing data storage with price	0
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
some people problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
setup was very easy	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1

i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this an average of per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but computer is incredible	1
some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to point where i was having to it and computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the unit great with my cassette adapter for my is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
price	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
no matter the format	1

mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0

for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
i try navigating using the player is built menu and it still would nt work	0

c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1

the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a version you have to the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0

the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0

i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1

anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about of their products and willingness to stand behind them	0
the reason i rated it a four is of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
i really love this netbook	1

quite the firmware and or the that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
i guess that means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
of torture in the hands of t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
so far the router has worked well	1
i like the automatic lock	1

and	1
overall an excellent phone	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1

this machine is replacement your desktop	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0

its more difficult to select songs and has use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address ect like the ipod	0

this is i ve purchased	1
it is mac	0
last night	1
speakerphone	1
the sound quality is really good	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
i to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
it was enough to remove the plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
the image quality is excellent	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that would from a true line out jack	0

i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i am and looking elsewhere for that can withstand the rigor	0
last night i needed to reset the router	0
you can move the range to almost anywhere in the scene with the of button and it has an on manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
reviews for are generally positive	1
very easy to set up	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
ripping songs is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
i ve had it for about weeks and is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and to find what you re looking for	0
again were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
material is on the cheap side	0

for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod podcasts in an intimate setting	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
is a great camera for you	1
everything seems to work well	1
the appearance is okayed	1
the color screen makes this after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
usb means fast data transfers	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
also the display is hinged and it can be in a myriad of positions or to protect it against	1
hopless hopeless company and customer support	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
kudos apple though your products are superb quality your support is equal	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
it made of plastic	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
the monitors were both good	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb is on the top floor rrb and very user in the setup and security aspects	1
i agree the earlier reviewer who said that is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather but only it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0

the manual does a job filling in that remain	1

takes excellent	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0

people also have complained about the case having a window but that is not really to me either the case is sturdy offers very good	1
my pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
the customer support is very rude	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit cool	1
the dvd player is fine	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually to use the camera	1
tech was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use works great for me many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
it is small	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
going for a cellphone was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
excellent range of metering options as	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
do nt buy this player	0
as a portable player it should feel bit more durable	0
and amazon com has it for such a great how can you go wrong	1
had a jvc system that was years and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound amazing	1
shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
only con i can think of is no camera	0
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
the replacable battery is great once it eventually wears out you will be to buy another easily	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
sometimes the system would hang i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
i trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything easy to use	0

very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
value comparing with price	1
highly getting the superdrive the wifi bluetooth modules	1
when player was working it but	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
worked from at which time the picture failed completely	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are sensibilities	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
portable	1
speakerphone loud and clear some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
loved the design	1
d link dir extreme n wireless router fine as a n wireless router	0
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
when the player was working it was great but	0
the only i have found i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses	0
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn	0
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
like other reviewers installation was	1
the memory is staggering	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
so off i went get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
its far more to select songs easy to the fly playlist such as the new ipod not to mention it does sinc contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
upon opening these i found them to be but a solid to them	1
but canon never	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the sounding	1
apparently mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
playlists can be the fly without aid and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playlists	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can go wrong	0
the more i the more i love it	1
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
is beautiful	1
on average indoor shots a flash are quite as good as mm	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
i purchased two of for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
you re looking for a quality tower speaker is it	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
they re pretty comfortable stay and deliver a decent quality	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
anyway is a great deal i really love it	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming work apex dvd players and	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
i am not to savy with a computer the d link is very to install and set up	0
this has so many capabilities that you always have for new technologies as they evolve	1
very long lasting battery life	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
was even worse than the which was now working fine	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
the sound pretty good also lrb although not anything a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player result in a good product	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
even leaving on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
due to the lack support for and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
they are clears and perfect be used along with a sub	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
a week out of the box and i began to see contractions to time growing more frequent each day	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
this time d link support was more helpful guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
small size	1
i ve had no problems at all so far i m very happy	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
music organization is based on id and this can be for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
it is light to carry around all day without bother	1
the player is sound is superior to the ipod	1
seemed like a good this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
honestly i love this player	1
to pair	1
thuumbs to acer ultra slim monitor	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
i have disappointed to find that there no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the picture is clear bright and sharp and is good	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
best support i have ever experienced	1
when i got it home i that the options sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual with pictures so i am very pleased	1
user replaceable battery	1
however you do get what you pay for reliable products	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit between shots	0
sound quality is wonderful i like the smart volume sound normalization	1
yes picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
best in class sound	1
ripping and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
image clarity is great lrb i a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
second gripe the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
it easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
they have a whole bunch of devices all have the same sounding name	0
ring tones only come crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and did	1
when i put it to use for my daughter graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked even out of doors	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology used in the zx	1
it starts skipping like dvd is are dirty	0
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
after nearly pictures i have that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
for a price is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get and the best it works as great as it was advertised to then some	1
the is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
however of the latest software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too order to reclaim	0
for the first few weeks was everything i expected it to be an affordable format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the is excellent the battery life is excellent the that the battery is excellent finally the price cheaper the gb ipod is excellent	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
it has good color and price was great	1
overall a sweet machine	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
this and what a toy it	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
storage capacity	1
with the smooth knob i find hard to judge if am actually gripping it and by feel alone	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a so could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
web cam is fairly good light in weight and elegant cons wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping music files into it	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of	0
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included cable	0
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1

the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
image	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
it is the best camera on the market	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work due to heavy snow	0
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
has a type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound	1
i nt think really matters though i mean my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while and the picture was awesome	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1

lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1

no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0

it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point	1
overall i like the unit	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc very fast and	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
i like the automatic key lock function	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this were blurry and a shade of orange	0
other than that this thing is great	1
the price is very good	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
maybe it is my lack experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone excellent	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
no dead pixels on mine	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1

my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no update to support this product	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
this happened with different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	1

the size is bit bigger than the ipod and a little bit more	1

there is no speaker grill offer any protection to the driver	0

now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1

picture in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
this product is amazing	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0

battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1

the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the headphones but you can really expect much out of the small you insert	0
this means there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
material is on the cheap side	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
the problem with this box is that several times an hour if not more frequently	0
the set is working just fine	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
it is easy enough for grandmother to use	1
the price performance looked just right	1

you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1

i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
quite simply the firmware or the os that this thing is not ready for prime time	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
another nice thing is that has digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
so far the router has worked well	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1
i did nt want one which i would have to put in batteries myself that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
otherwise a very monitor for its price	0
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
first the zen lets sync to more than one computer	1

to my amazement even process was	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
i have tried several times to contact digital their on line support site and their telephone line they nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always	0
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1

however its x optical is for of the shots that i take	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light is nice for shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router will find today lrb am writing this on nov rrb	1
the memory is staggering	1
they sound wonderful in my have nt even touched any equalizers	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
i do nt for see myself any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
got system error days after purchase	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
very bad	0
multiple play modes tracks order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
sound quality is good	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
avoid this model like the	0
fragile	0
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
the software mediasource can not on my pc	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
my dad has an apex tv it was another value for the	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
great value gb gb ipod for the price	1
the lcd is larger than the model the nx and has a bright backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
i immediately had problems getting to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
nearly pictures i have found that nikon takes incredible pictures	1
very long lasting battery life	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i onscreen displays	1
it is crystal clear	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
no matter the	1

the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1

it would either not play the at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting my desk	0
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
after several years of torture in of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0

screen was good easy to read	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
the xtra sounds great with good headphone	1

if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1

the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0

at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1

i took with this new product and pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid that is the price current of the art	1
i the storage in this thing	0

its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
very long lasting battery life	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and i have ever used	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would her from bringing work home	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
i have no complaints	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots are not going to be in a regular setting	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1

what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when take holiday plane rides	1

navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1

i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
others have better luck i have seen a flat panel	0
was very large and	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
just an average user getting value in this product	0
beautiful home theater music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
the did nt work corectly from the start the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1

my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it because it does it so often	0
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only it is the best in cellphones	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
the instructions that come do nt explain how to make things simple	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
but is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it on players in a different class	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it top of a portable radio but was trying use in the car which somewhat of a disappointment	0
it equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
it worked from to at which time the picture	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
i bought this monitor a couple months ago and i have very satisfied with it so far	1
the functionality on this camera is	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i	0
phone i d buy another	0
easy to	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think justify the huge difference in price	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a clean look	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
color screen is good	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably overworked	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
seems like a good product	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
this really is a great little phone got nice features great ergonomics and its tiny	1
equipment included is average but that is a big deal since that s not what are buying it for	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the sound quality is very good	1
does not provide enough when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
it most bang for the buck out there	1
i got this on my truck and i m happy with it for the most it is and super easy to install however you are going to want for i	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
silverish color really adds special touch	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the second set is working just fine	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
if want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
price performance looked just right	1
worked fine	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse is stiff	0
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
this camera is every penny and i highly recommend it	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line the other hand was very helpful	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
can do with it such as choose what kind of now interface can see the interface as modern or classical	1
weaknesses the feel and layout of the remote control are only so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
you see the lens barrel in	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
i spend hours day a vnc session the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
the creative labs zen xtra has the features the i pod and if get if from amazon your only going to for this great player	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the gb zen xtra rocks spills but does nt wash	1
also you can store data on it which is for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt this is a much better buy	1
my blu ray player and live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform forever thereafter	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
so if you re game a little you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
pc is too expensive for a usb cable	0
wire runs through the body the stand giving it a very clean look	1
of course have some good customization options the unit as well	1
quite bulky uses a heavy battery as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
the nikon coolpix wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it	0
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and all play great	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not anything now	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
it is also a bigger than expected that is ok because is something to work with my iphone	0
video output stopped	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made experience photography on a totally new level	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings and am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was of the router	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
it a fun little gadget do nt high definition sound	0
i would strongly recommend this product	1
very prompt standard shipping service	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said would play dvd rs fill of files	1
not only is it the perfect size it also all the features a high tech phone user	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
protective case completely useless is since it	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
took me a few tries to but it is very user friendly player imo	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is weeks without a reply	0
great picture	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i it from a fairly short distance	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised how well this baby runs	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
honestly i love this player	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
i ve had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
it looks very cool seems quite small to me very light	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
living in small apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
overall i like the unit	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
living in a small college apartment the s and were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
setup from in the box to completely working for preset stations was under minutes	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
it has beautiful design lots features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub the control station is too short	0
neither message was answered	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
well was nice while it lasted	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer easy too	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
this player to work fine with everything else	1
difficult i wo necessarily but i do nt enjoy the to navigate	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
flash as in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
fact is could nt	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
however the creative software is not	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line constantly busy	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this not to the zen it applies to all the company products	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone ve ever had	1
easy enough but it did not	0
okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
the woofer is much larger	1
i have over files in my playlist the moment and the random does a nice job mixing up	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
brightness is easy four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
you create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to and rip directly from cd to	1
the and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
i purchased a jukebox it got asked usd just to look it and said that they would charge for repaing the damned thing	0
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
one other issue that the headphone jack so standard headphones will not work	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod i gotten to them and did not think justify the huge difference in price	0
it is easy	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for and i am very happy with it	1
of use and it no recognizes anything	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided to the actual problem which was the router failed to auto the ethernet link from fios optical network block	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any to the driver	0
for instance i several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and and it plays the dvds	1
overall a good buy price	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
i now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
this machine change your whole idea what a laptop be	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
well within days video output quit working	0
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
you ll be changing track information lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
good speed	1
this camera is closest than any other digicam that megapixel	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
sub woofer is large	1
a good buy for the price	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd only the audio no picture	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
even with these shortcomings i think it is the best camera available under	1
it is to through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate once you are calling answers the phone not while is ringing	0
nokia and t really teamed up well on this baby	1
other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	0
counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
my house is small it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners no signal interruptions	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually no disc	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1

i the apex ad to be a great buy	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0

chic look and the player in a compact form	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the and hope my review helped	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
i tried to play three times with no success	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
on indoor shots with a flash are not as as mm	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
far the router has worked well	1
this small size speaker system out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
i find it too bright	0
system was nowhere near and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1

last night i needed to reset the router	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1

and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
what a	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
died very after getting them	0
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb what ever stupid size it rrb power adapter	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
not only is it more affordable but its which is what i have	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
setup software for my application found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
p it not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which when are bored	0
the dvd player	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
other than that this thing is great	1
the controls on the player are very simple for a manual	0
the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some company to unlock all the features	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
this phone me over and a seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
not play relies on i d no fm or recording	0
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
over for the this is a unit	0
d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
its x setting acceptable for of the shots that i take	1

the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
the build quality is top notch	1
this unit was working fine for st month and a half then the color signal disappeared	0
t which does not work along several long stretches on same route	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours it up for my mom for christmas but that was long for me problems with this dvd player	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1

it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
i try navigating a chapter past via the menu it would nt do it	0
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
i a little disappointed in the low end	0
it is worth it	1
really love this netbook	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does seem to read certain dvds	0
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be than using windows explorer	1
clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
the only drawback the speaker wire is very thin	0
minimal pause between songs less good achievement for a drive based player	0
i had mine and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the port on the back is a nice feature	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
both dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter the player kept going	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
for those who want the that this is capable of producing very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
overall i would these someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
newbies find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the	1
it is made of plastic	0
i ve been g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that is advertised	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the monitors were both good	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the volume	0
when you turn on your player player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe the quality you would from a true line out jack	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
for the price it a very nice dvd player	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve	0
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about of the way down from the the screen that interferes with	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
i m with this product	1
the colors and everything are great	1
i it up only produced a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
highly recommend this hard to beat at this price point	1
however a phone call to the d support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
i can t it star because when does work it is pretty good	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
what added in functionality detracts in build quality as is prone to popping off	0
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone any i ve before	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds the side speakers like did with my old front speakers	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
also for some reason the picture washed on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
this is my creative labs mp player it is definitely a fine product	1
mediasource did not install my personal notebook	0
you can also assign special people when they call	1
the prints are beautiful	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
took me a few tries to get to the navigation but is a very user friendly player imo	1
well backlit keypad	1
it is tall so i ended up laying on its side	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
was surprised to find that not only could dvd player play which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it was able to play which i created with smart ripper	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
for all the features	1
screen brightness is really good	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
good looks	1
was comparable to or possibly than the old linksys router i had been using for years	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
i tried calling the support number for a week a day and always got a busy	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
however you do get what you for in reliable products	1
asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it could nt be happier and i convinced it is the best one out there	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has excellent	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
tried to play three times with no success	0
works great	1
house is small so it is hard to the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house worked in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	0

all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
it	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so it has been excellent	1

about the time it can find when i attach it to my pc	0
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
overall the nikon a dependable robust and useful little camera	1
it does well in all of internet browsing	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
this thing is trash	0
i like the automatic key lock function	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
i did read a thing how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
easy to use a lot has mentioned about this	1
this product is good integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
i had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but in that this is because different less expensive not necessarily inferior technology is used	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
in fact say not bright enough	0
with gb of storage i have about songs the with about more	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
to my a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
this little speaker dynamite sound	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
plusses the easy to remove and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
i am really impressed by this dvd	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
but this camera is great	1
when you put in your pocket you forget it is there it is and oh so light	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that your ipod is an iskin case you can not the ipod without first removing the skin	1
i m not to shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not perfectly or need lighting adjustments this camera very simple and effective	0

the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
you re need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0

is a travesty enough said	0

the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable easy to use	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner my basement	1
both units are small similarly	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
acer has awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
i am using jbl n ii left right which again a very nice set	1
the inside pics be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
i m very happy i ll probably buy more	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
investment	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd	0
i am not to savy with a computer but the link is very easy to install and set up	1
both are very easy learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
the first i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had be returned	0
bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel combos and many of the user friendly functions very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the computer processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
now there is and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with cf which gives raw images as opposed to	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend photographs from a distance	0
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
very good value for the money	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could get to work before anything but the dvd burner itself that had made the disc with	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on others on the dvd	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
however i think this camera is excellent choice	1
this led monitor is fantastic	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars	1
but you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt you take pics with it on which is real good	1
cheap construction they should have made out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
so sit back relax and brag to your friends who paid a mountain for dvd player that can t half the things this one and for a fraction of the price	1
the storage capacity	1
with this mp player you get much more for much less than an ipod	1
bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the player has its glitches like for example when i turn on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have turn off and turn it on again which is not	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in a useful application which converts types of metrics	0
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see dvd is after the frustration and of getting the player to do it is job	0

i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is better designed than the s	1

it is crystal clear	1
great	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i home tuesday	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
sharp image	1
if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
it is running great for the dvds i have and rented	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do for me and custom eq was a limited band eq	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0

the is sound quality is great do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1

second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0

i this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
compared everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
also you can store it which is a plus for all you people who to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
i fully it go bad again or some other in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0

bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0

both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but durability was big zero	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1

bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features include ability to use external flash lense filters choices	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0

p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0

only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user	1

overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
on the positive side the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
the creative is awkward difficult to use and just plain does on some computers	0
the zennx will keep running for price of a replacement battery just like any other battery appliance	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1

the keys are close together and layout is funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it	0
great picture	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
i would not be to purchase an apex product again	0
overall i am and will be using it often	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
i know will problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will worth it since will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
proven canon built quality and lens	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
get it is woth penny	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0

the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1

however once you the volume a little to too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it nicely without falling out	1
the manual is easy to understand and is mostly idiot proof	1
sharp image	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i can see a drastic difference between this and dell in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
this is a great piece system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
material is on the cheap side	0
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
the picturers amazing	1
surprisingly everything seems work well	1
also a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure d leave sprint	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
or maybe netgear up the firmware for this device that does know what to do	0
and have had no problems	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they the front of the tv	1
catch the canon g camera that its unresponsiveness will cause to miss precious shots	0
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was to the modem rrb	0
the sound this slim design puts out	1
from t mobile is very good too	1
while i the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an fm phone and earpiece	1
moveable lcd screen	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the optical zoom works great and the x zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
when the matrox g dvi comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
is the most bang for the buck out there	1
this is a winner	1
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
overall a sweet	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
the phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
also it with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
great camera and the price you can t beat it	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
very good and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the lcd than the previous model the nx has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
quite bulky and uses as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly same as my old netgear	1
the sound clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
i ve sent to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
what a disappointment	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
after multilple tries was finally recognized but video was poor and	0
i have had no problem so ever this product	1
good looks	1
progressive scan for a relatively low price	1
typically problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0

there is much which has been about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either nas or print server	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
i hours on the with their tech support lrb you and do nt have to rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
it is worth it	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i	1
however it does not play windows media and i not get it any of my divx rips	0
and the body construction has a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft the s	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
it plays basically every media i ve so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago the rental dvd that could nt played on my old sharp player	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is than with standard speakers making it harder to hear	0
what disappointed me is the fact it does seem	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations this price	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
i this player	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
i tried calling the support number a several a day always got a busy signal	0
i am absolutely in awe camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
frame freezes and the family somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
i do nt for myself having any issues in however if i do i that with this product it will taken care of for free and quick with helpful and customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
great	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0

it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
works super easy	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you get in the states	0
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone has already come loose	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
setup is and it worked right out of the box	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
i put it to use for my daughter graduation the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the interface software itself which be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
and love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
whether you re taking or just having lunch at the park you ll glad you had the fm radio	1
the quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops and now there to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
the quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while discs and the picture and sound is notch	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the pc sync feature superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
the appearance is okayed	1
is great	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume on this phone is especially quiet	0
volume level is ok	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices i ve ever owned	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
the day arrived when i was sure d leave sprint	0
sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a of for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time charge it mp s quickly and is delay between songs	0
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and a repair facility to match their products	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
oops easy go online and adjust it there	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would give it up for anything	1
have used it frequently and had no problems	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products no to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
with gb of storage have songs on the player with	1
lots of flaws exceptional sound quality hd size and make it a good buy	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the speakers perform and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
is very good and are bright and even changeable	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource you can listen as they directly from the xtra	1
i only have complaint and that is	0
sub woofer is large	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
speakerphone	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged and works the next day	0
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
we got on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
is phenomenal	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
the ihome stereo reproduction clearly superior	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
you can not get mid range or bass lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how tweak the levels	0
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
i was looking forward to it even if all other reviews said it was slow	0
i give it a rating stars	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we got in touch with them customer support telephone number is always busy and they do answer their web customer support	1
the storage capacity is great	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
only if we could get one camera in it	0
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
sound quality	1
only owned it about two weeks so expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
scroll button switch	0
was	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
it has all the features one would need a cellphone	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
it works great	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data	1
it has all features one would need in a cellphone	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
this is a nice feature i e is early in the morning you rather listen to easy listening heavy metal no problem	1
this thing is i like to use it to pick up tough stains also listen to my old track records	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
it so but big value mac	1
summary i love this camera and would heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
the fm radio is cool	1
navigating through the menus is super easy if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i did read a thing about how to operate it it was intuitive	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if tend to photographs from a distance	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be it often	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
creative mediasource software ok to catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before bought the zen and guess what	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
have this monitor a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
the problems came from my video card	0
unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
newbies will the full auto setting will them perfect pictures out of the box	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it really annoying when it does because does it so often	0
very good value for the money	1
then my dvds stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the g looks like a work of art	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
i like the size and weight	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the to for music contained in a folder unavailable	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
does not at random times despite being connected and player is library	0
i m glad canon decided to keep mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
for the price and features is really good	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is work with my iphone	0
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
great price	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
way can t go with this price	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad you get nailed times lrb that is about as bad it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
the replacement was even worse original one which was now working fine	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the	0
mid range is nt best but it is certainly there enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
speed showed that the speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
after months it stoppped higher number scenes on dvds	0
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the plus this makes for a great product	1
one bad thing is it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash and for most purposes it is not enough	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about of this speaker	0
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
fantastic w iphone docked	1
they are clears and perfect to be used	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the keyboard is also although it does take some getting used to	0
highly recommended otherwise	1
maybe it my lack of experience but found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature the person are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
i was to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i love this player and probably go with creative labs again	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
software is easy to use	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing minus	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
overall an excellent phone	1
but it seems to work so that i do nt anticipate any problems	1
the on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being to certain special features on a rental dvd	0
its far heavier much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
it also has unproven battery life	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
it is easy enough to use for beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
it just such a light weight non intrusive device which you	1
works flawlessly during installation cx	1
my only gripe about the is the buttons	0
otherwise this player is awesome	1
main dial is not backlit	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
i love the of the pictures	1
range of functions as indicated it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those are serious about photography	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention were polyphonic	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
thanks to amazon is return was able to return the product at no loss my part	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to people know that if your ipod is in an case can not the ipod without first	1
the sound quality excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means advantage	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
i love this player	1
it really easy to set out of the box and i got my wireless devices lrb desktop smartphones rrb to the internet in minutes	1
does not player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
it was easy to set out i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
that is a feature	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
mobile is heavily back logged and t keep up with	0
can also assign special rings and graphics to special people they call	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains and also to listen to my track records	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
and works great too	1
am with how easy this camera is to use	0
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
storage	1
the had focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
of note the battery life is incredible	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
so the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	0
perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
other than that is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
bottom line great product price	1
it makes for this by being extremely easy to with well laid out controls that can be	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
be for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
the volume	0
this system is very powerful	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
the volume	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
takes excellent photos	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
suffers quality product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback problems with the headphone jack	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
p s remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
the sound from the player is	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
first of all the player is is superior to the ipod	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and wise zens are unbeatable	1
usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
all the latest acer stuff is top	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
if you re for opinion of the apex player i	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone wants a set of small effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is support was no help at all	0
the scroll button at times not sensitive enough at others	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
slr like programming and gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
awesome system	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
it has never worked	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
usb makes for very fast transfers	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
technical support and unhelpful	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
it has a nice color screen	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
anyways back to the i ve tried be so calm the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
the operation with the increased memory option was with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter and nobody mention this	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors de focused text	0
great features	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the image quality is excellent	1
the canon computer software to download sort upload and manage your digital on computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the seems to do only slightly better	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
is very easy use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about any one of my cds	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is easy	0
as stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your	0
great good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
they could be comfortable but no	1
not plug play relies on i no fm or recording	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors already been for repair or replacement	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
this really is a great little phone its got features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
easy to use with clear contained in the install drive	1
the phone is light and very attractive	1
great camera	1
i have this monitor for a few months and have had no	0
are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
software is easy to use	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0
the only things i have found that i is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone is too	0
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
otherwise this player	0
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has i have nt even to all of them yet	1
reason i rated it a four is because that diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so can t get an accurate adjustment	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
although the nokia is a little short features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
the software	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
i loved the of and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
there is no way the battery supplied	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer effective in organizing your collection and is to a good cddb service	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
so easy set up had some with my archos	1
i the fact i carry it in my shirt or pants pocket forget about it	0
the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
the data rate over is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
great quality picture and features	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
the changing colors help with a quick glance	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
the build quality is top notch	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow shots	0
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
range functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are about photography	1
tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
in addition it comes with sleek and powerful headset	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
when tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn work either	0
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
i recently purchased canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
this play is basicly junk	0
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
well backlit keypad	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
in short you re that is a little of technology and you just want a router to get online do and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion than an ipod	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume and simple selector buttons	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the function lever which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
does have a lense cap but it wo nt let take pics with it is real good	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
price	1
key instead	0
i was surprised how good the sound and i especially like to use it when i am listening to books	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
delivery was prompt	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
you do with it such as choose what kind of you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
it has one is that the songs not automatically play one like on a cd	0
i was worried that would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone earpiece	1
however speed reliability and power to transmit a signal the house are your requirements this router do the job	1
it came well packaged	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
i got this for christmas and it is great gift	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the price the lowest d seen in my research best buy office depot rrb	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
you ll be changing track a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
is it could nt be easier to use	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
it came well packaged	1
also very light	1
in class sound	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
amazon com has it how can you	1
is even more pleased due its widescreen	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
recieved in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
also did nt the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
this unit was working fine for the st month a half then the color signal disappeared	0
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
good battery life	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits low to the desk	0
controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that where my thumb is when i hold thing	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest i have ever seen or used	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
the fm radio is cool	1
great sound battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality and an unbeatable price	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
this system is very powerful	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
neither message was answered	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
it is light enough to around all day without bother	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
huge storage space even at kbs can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
main dial is not backlit	0
great phone i d buy another	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
i the i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	0
are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
after about an hour starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
this product is too for normal use	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on	1
lrb yeah like you use a new very expensive modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound as the on stage and are truly portable lrb can played without power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the pictures are razor sharp in macro	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the subwoofer is and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
works great	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
has so many capabilities that you ll always have as they evolve	1
very pleased with it so far	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a signal from the machine	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
is fantastic	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you them on with the sound	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i can see between in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
wo nt play of my movies which are all	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live since it saves me from lugging cd case to work in the car etc	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
i d to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set costwise	1
connect to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
they look fantastic	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the storage capacity is great	1
minimal between less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
paid than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected get a good quality product these random disconnects kills for me	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed are organized in alphabetical order	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in camera	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even i love this phone	1
conclusion i was to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it adjust the equalizer for you can be a big hassle	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it mp s and there is no delay between songs	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork having just dropped the bones for this router i very unimpressed	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
i ve also had the nomad zen	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
you want to a cd title that have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
you can manage your profile the contrast of make different of display either list or tabbed	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
i am disappointed and looking something that can withstand the rigor of a business	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be to zoom and review pictures	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
and it works great too	1
it an extremely cool gizmo	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
they to yet it is weeks without	0
the quality is superb	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the cover came with it did nt fit very well	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the grain was terrible	0
difficult to change for large number of tracks	0
for the price it is	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
i the bass this thing i have two subs in my that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the memory is staggering	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
but the sound and works well	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
this is by the nicest one in so many ways	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
what a junk	0
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen gb and it	0
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
bright visible screen	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and choices	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i wanted the to work soo bad it just did nt	0
storage space i loaded my entire collection music is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
nice little phone light compact	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job it up	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
my only significant complaint is	0
some features in the user interface	0
it is but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera grow into	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
on dvds it refuses to play episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
t is does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
the fact that this model would play slideshows was a me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r disk without vcd formatting	1
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
my only complaint is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
best camera from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but	0
its to serve as a up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
has worked	1
user replaceable	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far it is delivery so my wife is no giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
i was pleasantly that customer service was able to me thru manual setup	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is and you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
even when you it will upon keep your computer is new even when is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly through groove in the bottom of the base	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
also the carrying case came mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i to open it up see the display	0
the canon g is the best mp camera out there	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is raw image	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus speaker makes it even great i this phone	1
the first routers worked for years	1
it is small	1
the is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
the reception sound quality top notch	1
the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was to fair	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i got this thing for christmas i have been very with it ever since	1
i d buy another	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
unfortunately it turns out to	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is as season and season	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
the daylight pictures and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
product is definitely worth the purchase	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
this phone has many other features ir just name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
i did nt but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their line is always busy	0
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
when got it home discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email were nt there	0
the only complaint i have that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in it sticks	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
it still fits in palm of and it not heavy	1
even on g band than the linksys	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
i just it up manually which is very easy	1
usb means fast data transfers	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens	0
no propietary headset jack	0
both the black the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
also i can t understand why the software does not the when it lists the cds alphabetical order	0
this phone is great as a whole and is like others with one or two good qualities	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
even works better on g band than the	1
i have ice age and it keeps me no disc	0
this camera also has a great feel and weight to	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i nt after day	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
color and contrast	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i has and you get if from amazon your going to pay for this great player	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
the sound quality is very good	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
the software	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take unbelievably close the subject	1
small size	1
this is an excellent value	1
started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
the only downside is the remote which a line of sight	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
cons i the satellites look ugly	0
if you nt have tags it ll all of your tracks into the same directory and they not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
i simply love this feature	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
i like the nomad is color better but is not terribly flashy	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
overall an excellent phone	1
please consider of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
headphones suck i invest since it has the eax feature	0
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
works super easy	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one on a cd	0
so if you re game for little you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
the eax features are cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered or on a train	1
and man i had work to put my chinese songs on the player because i the actual chinese names of as the title	0
before asking the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m it is the best one out there	1
the phone has but because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with that you expected this phone to do	0
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
i was surprised good sound was i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
seriously this thing has that could want	1
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that now	1
i do nt always care for but it allows easy editing id tags	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of of	1
very simple to use	1
after a and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality pixel	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the picturers are amazing	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have of good bass	1
it is small	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library does work with mp s the goes on and on	0
creative labs support website is useless	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it well never dropped it and the headphone jack	1
things are much more distinct and i do have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb i had to with my old	1
easy enough to navigate although i d prefer a sturdier button the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
d link support was polite tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
seems like a good product	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio though the latter was not literature i d scanned before buying	1
nice machines but i consider quality low now	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
in fact it caused my system hang more times not so i uninstalled it stuck with mediasource	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
no propietary headset jack	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
i treat the battery well and has lasted	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer like winamp with the options	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
set up wpa with no problems	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
sometimes system would hang so i have to restart the router then get going again	0
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
scroll button switch	0
i loved it until it broke but less a month is an acceptible period of time for to work	0
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
fm receiver it has none	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
i love this monitor	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
i easily enlarging pictures to with visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	0
like other reviewers was hell	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
after hooking the thing i found that it would only played less than of the dvds put in it	0
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
we two phones for the t mobile family plan and came with a broken headphone and one today after less than two weeks of use	0
it takes approximately to seconds to lrb i have timed it rrb which nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
they fired away the picture turned out quite nicely	1
playlists can made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for now playing selections or	1
the problems came from my video card	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
x zoom is nice	1
the canon g tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
the connection is not reliable constantly dropped	0
bright visible screen	1
the battery life is amazing	1
software the software is crap	0
it would just spin up stop and display no disc	0
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
this phone is a winner	1
this thing is trash	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
for the money have good features	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a portable hard drive albeit one on which can create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
one good it is gb of disk space	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but is always display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen interferes with viewing at most settings	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
have the player since xmass and love it	1
