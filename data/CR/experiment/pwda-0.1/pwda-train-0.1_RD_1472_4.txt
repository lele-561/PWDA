pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
software is another misfortune hard to operate frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1

i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
my only gripe about the is the buttons	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and be using it often	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into rest of my furniture	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
i love extremely low bass and as such i suplemented the a sweet jbl sub	1
cons i the satellites look ugly	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to two of my favorite dvds	0
newbies will the full auto setting will them perfect pictures out of the box	1
at an incredible price	1
screen was good easy to read	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to	0
of course i was given the price but i ve been extremely impressed receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present my parents	1
i m delighted with this product	1
also the player freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
this was an player before the video output no longer worked	0
the on button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
customer service and technical are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about quality of their products and their to stand behind them	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so though the side controls are reachable i have open up to see the display	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
their network coverage is very sporadic the network always resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
i did ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
this is extemely lame	0
it equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings it allows easy editing of i d	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0

when i got it home i that the options sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
my two main requirements longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
support from is literally nonexistent	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
you can do other different things with it as kind of now playing interface can see the interface as modern or classical	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
however you the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like get with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
thanks amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
looks ok very shiny and mirrors	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex player i love it	1
image is excellent	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
i do like this overall unforutnately i am returning it	1

it does well in of internet browsing	1
there is no speaker grill offer any protection to the driver	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0

my wife is even more pleased due its widescreen	1
great camera	1
it is to through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
this is of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
now heres the stuff you should starting with the things the screen is really big and the blue light in back is perfect fast as hell in controls are to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load onto this	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not using the best possible setting as yet	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of from a detail tonal balance color response point of view	1
the first i had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no down or tilt feature rrb	0
backlight periodically fail it happened i sent it for warranty repair	0
overall	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection shutter speed and aperture without to fumble through menu options	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
they sound wonderful in my have nt even touched any equalizers	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0

the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work t mobile is services they deleted the menu options that would enable you to the to be used on a different network	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds i bought the zen and guess what	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0

things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
on average indoor shots a flash are quite as good as mm	1
overall i like the unit	1
navigation system i d tags that are embedded in the mp files organize your songs	0
is	1
so slow it is not useable for files any size or back ups	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
bass fanatics look the s pii	1
the system and the code was in alpha stage	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1

the clips taken will always some noise you can t avoid that	0
takes excellent	1
it plays basically every media i so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
best in class sound	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
what a disappointment	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
first of all my calls were loud and unlike with sprint	0
the software on the router pretty good	1
the zen stores data files but does allow a folder structure nor allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
looks like a work of art	1
easy enough to navigate although i d prefer a sturdier button the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
this camera has a design flaw	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone ve ever had	1
i ve had the nomad zen lock up several times	0

comparing data storage with price	0

have been ripping songs into it the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1

battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
overall i would these someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
the size is bit bigger than the ipod and a little bit more	1
it is most bang for the buck out there	1
this phone is great as a and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
music organization is based on id and this can be for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
price performance looked just right	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector	0
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1

i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton different equilizer type deals on here	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
i have that the interface on the nomad is easy use you have a basic knowledge of computer	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and did	1
line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
for the price it is	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
my issue with the mediasource software is that pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
on the positive side the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1

even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is nice feature when you are bored	1
what added in functionality detracts in build quality as is prone to popping off	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player sub par	0
sometimes the system hang so i would have to restart the router then get going	0
the screen quality is very high side view is very sharp clear	1
is the most bang for the buck out there	1
you be changing a lot because the cd database information by the software is mediocre at best	0
when talking the voice is not very clear	0

easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
recent price drops made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1

well it had good power but no precision at all	1
the quality is excellent	1

we purchased universal remotes so far claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus me as a visual and i discovered by accident that it play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
other than that is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this	1
i checked out and m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
the monitors were both good	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
does what it should and the sound seems to me	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1

this product is too for normal use	0
last note i this monitor with than what can get in the states	0
came packaged	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and of the remote control are only so so it does show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting getting back normal size	0
shipping and they are very easy to set up	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect against any damage	1
even is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with clarity	1

i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
it the usb interface on the router to be either for nas or print server	1

this router is the best i have used to date	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1

i was surprised how good the sound and i especially like to use it when i am listening to books	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and i have open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or the sound is much more acceptable	0
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0

i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1

started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0

for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but enough so it does nt blind when you stare too long	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level this phone is especially	1
okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
they problem ie product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0

slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1

dead on mine	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1

it does tend to run quite hot and be given lots of room for air circulation	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is dialing	1

it is overall bigger than the but keep in mind this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i onscreen displays	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
upon opening these i found them to be but a solid to them	1
thought the software was decent enough it was nt to learn at	1
it is of plastic	0

that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
no way to contact their customer service	0

the possibilities with auto manual the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings portrait landscape beach sunset etc are	1

after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0

i the bass this thing i have two subs in my that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
this router is awesom but it only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1

in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
i find it too bright	0
i am and looking elsewhere for that can withstand the rigor	0
is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
my gut tells me the nomad in the long run be at best a gb hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
other things i miss are voice activated and a standard mm headset jack	0
first a tad bulky not most asthetic looking and does nt support a folder stucture	0
its focusing system is also very flexible	1

the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen than the nx is green backlight did	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound as the on stage and are truly portable lrb can played without power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits low to the desk	0
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish case advertised	1
p s remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is	1

this is a great piece system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
the day i turned on my laptop it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the player itself has all sorts problems	0
the lcd is larger than the model the nx and has a bright backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1

i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
well it was nice it lasted	1
i ve this just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
the is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours re entering numbers	1
in addition it only seems work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
but this camera is great	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
it has and very few bad ones	1
course i was given the but i ve extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
ring tones only with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the problems came from my video card	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they the front of the tv	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1

its far heavier much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use the bundled nomad explorer software	0
this is a winner	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
easy to pair	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
i purchased three these at very good rates we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1

the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
good looks	1
after some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the reception sound quality top notch	1
well it had good power but	1
the main problem with the nomad zen xtra gb is the software	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
its fast forward and rewind much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
it an extremely cool gizmo	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is really robust what others have said though notmad may work better	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot	1
my ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after and perform well forever thereafter	1
these monitors great for the price	1
setup was very easy	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said would play dvd rs fill of files	1
the door would not close	0
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through groove in the bottom of the base	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
games kind stink and you ca nt download them you have get the link cable to get additional games	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
the function lever the one which between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
died very shortly after getting them	0
it is easy	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
great camera	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people but i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with too	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
product is hard to beat at any price	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without booming from the sub woofer no matter you tweak the levels	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
even better you do nt have to worry about replacing batteries	1
speakers very and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1

am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very with performance of the these compact speakers at the low price these sell for here on amazon	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection i go and the zen xtra is of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has excellent	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion than an ipod	0
sound is wonderful really the smart volume sound normalization	1
it is light to carry around all day without bother	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
best camera ever from the image quality color i can say almost everything	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was to the modem rrb	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
was	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
small	1
the headphone jack seems to be	0
there are so many functions in this little camera	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with	1
and it works great too	1
i that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
nice little phone light compact	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
the is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
flash as in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
newbies find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the	1
poor on the keys	0

first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1

on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
even when it will upon reboot keep saying your computer new even when it is nt and force it that your computer is authorized	0

when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i can t get a video from the machine	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0

all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone ve ever had	1
the first night got this phone i put it next to me when went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
compared everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
i love the of the pictures	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
i turned the phone on the first thing that hit how good the screen is	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
so sit back relax and brag to your friends who paid a mountain for dvd player that can t half the things this one and for a fraction of the price	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
awesome system	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt it rrb which does nt sound until get nailed times in hour lrb that is about as as it gets sometimes it for hours without rebooting rrb	0
the poor design continues with the case	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
the speakers perform and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
the manual mode is easy to use fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having fumble through menu options	1
finding a particular song or on the nomad jukebox is fast and	0
i chose g because of reputation for very high quality clean images	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1

however since i am in an office i keep them at a pretty low volume at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
navigating through the menus is super easy if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the top that the battery poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
in short you re that is a little of technology and you just want a router to get online do and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
both dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter the player kept going	0
the remote works but then does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile a	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
this thing is trash	0
my ap does not work as repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty you can get different variations with it	1
great picture	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
nice machines but i consider quality pretty low now	0
the fact that this model would play slideshows was a me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r disk without vcd formatting	1
screen brightness is really good	1
i like the unit	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
however speed reliability power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
the fm radio is cool	1
the problem is that the anything has connected to it has been around mb s even in	0
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
the instructions that come do nt explain how to make things simple	0
now that i have all my music on it has nt been any more problems	1
would nt buy again of the customer service	0
the size is small	1
value comparing with price	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
having makes for very fast transfers	1
easy to pair	1
the canon g of control for photo buffs still an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router will find today lrb am writing this on nov rrb	1
just it up manually is very easy	1
the dvd player	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
the pictures come out hazy if hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
i love this feature	1
it easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are with things that you expected this phone to do	0
for of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
but when we went to use it again there was sound but	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
not the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature find out more log on canon is website	1
i would have rated it five stars but the poor manual	0
in addition it with a remote control	1
storage capacity	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
is the finest camera in its and category i have ever used	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use in the car even with freeway noise	1
the speakers perform very and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
it looks great and is loaded	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen gb it is fantastic	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does some getting	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
i m still very frustrated with some the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i open up my sound card is control panel every time i between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time charge it mp s quickly and is delay between songs	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
is a piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using as yet	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
but if you looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player love it	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
only owned it about two so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
focusing on a display rack a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera blurry and in a shade of orange	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
software the software is	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography a totally new level	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume on this phone is especially quiet	0
overall i like the system features and performance	1
technical support and unhelpful	0
anyway is a great deal i really love it	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill for such a small speaker system	1
are on my but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
i have sent my ad back to because it wo nt certain disney and other dvd movies	0
this led monitor	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a and always got a busy signal	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
software the software is crap	0
awesome system	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
for of speakers the sound out is unbelievable	1
when i put it to in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
it dvd is problems the other two being afflicted a number of	0
overall it is the best the market	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
we got on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to	1
is overly sensitive at times not enough at others	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
took a chance with this product and am pleased except in months it will cost half of what i paid but that is price for current state of the art	1
the door	1

recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but is always display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen interferes with viewing at most settings	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0

is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1

in all i say this a decent for the money	1
in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1

they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
they look fantastic	1
i use this a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1

the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1

the dvd player is	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
it wo nt play of my movies	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that do nt know of rrb	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0

even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1

for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
the other day was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0

the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1

chic look and the player in a compact form	1
this player to work fine with everything else	1
the canon g is the best digital camera out there at this price point	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0

the combination of the storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
multiple play modes tracks order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1

i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0

the replacement was even worse original one which was now working fine	1
acer has awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0

the g has a different type from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging also enables you to use the camera plugged without running down battery	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1

the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for a small unit	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
volume	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it on players in a different class	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
at i called it quits and will sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the picturers are amazing	1
well within days the video output working	1
the changing colors help with a quick glance	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this	0
the connection is not reliable constantly dropped	0
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
it is easy enough for grandmother to use	1
the appearance is okayed	1
also you can store it which is a plus for all you people who to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
i did nt want one in which i have to put in batteries myself that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone there	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price can t go wrong	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds i did my old front speakers	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
weaknesses the feel and layout of the remote control are only so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
so now it still everything you just can t it	0
i was a little disappointed in low end	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
but the sound and works well	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
has good color and price was great	1
yes there a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this engineered it that way minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure d leave sprint	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
headphones suck i would invest some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
this phone is great as a and not like others one or two good qualities	1
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
when you your player the player turns on really fast and continues to play as left it when you were turning it off	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
good range speed	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
overall i like it	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
this really is a great little phone its got features and its tiny	1
i just it up manually which is very easy	1
user replaceable battery	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
while decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
working hours on shuffle totally rocks	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
megapixels is for anybody and the photo quality is	1
also very light and portable	1
i did a ton and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
this camera is great	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
it stands now the case is pretty useless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs	0
the connection is not reliable constantly dropped	0
when i put it use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc very fast and simple	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
i have tried several times to contact digital their on line support site and their telephone line they nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always	0
this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
have only used for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for to find problems with	0

all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
the player is mechanics are flawed	0
i purchased this phone for just and there is what i can do with it	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera the lens cap and itself	0
the is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
bookmarks are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
lrb yeah like you ll a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl instead	0
of course i was hesitant given the price but i been extremely impressed and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
camera a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt easy as i would have liked	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
my fiance ordered this computer is so needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing home with her	1
i started accessing transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
because it can help a so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the display is enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
they could be comfortable but no	1
the device itself	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad you get nailed times lrb that is about as bad it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
great camera great investment	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
honestly i love	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since s not you are buying it for	1
the main problems for me is that dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
earpiece is and easy to use	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
its far more difficult to select and has easy to use on the fly creation as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc contact lists numbers address like the ipod	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
so yes as with software was useless and ugly	0
color screen is good	1
other than that this thing is great	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and have been it so far	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
this thing is i like to use it to pick up tough stains also listen to my old track records	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really to rate it based on players in a different class	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we got in touch with them customer support telephone number is always busy and they do answer their web customer support	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads it is not too weird	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
but it seems to work so that i do nt anticipate any problems	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
since it would not i called support	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
the quality is superb	1
it played only one of three is without problems the other two by a number of glitches	0
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
color screen is good	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
first the zen lets sync to more than one computer	1
buttons seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
main dial is not backlit	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
if you are picky about image quality go for it	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
i am not to savy with a computer the d link is very to install and set up	0

uploading the images to my windows based pc very fast and	0
overall sounds great and less expensive than apple	1
the creative labs zen xtra has the features the i pod and if get if from amazon your only going to for this great player	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
the toggle button that is to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
setup was very easy	1
i did nt but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
set wpa with no problems	1
the storage capacity is great	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
sucks	0
it does well in all of internet browsing	1
asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it could nt be happier and i convinced it is the best one out there	1
main dial is not backlit	0
the first routers worked good years	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1

and the body in general quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
battery life is	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
great quality picture and features	1
tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
others may have better luck but i never a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0

it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is support was no help at all	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it really annoying when it does because does it so often	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
will in your pocket and not bother you	1
died very after getting them	0
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
just received this camera two and love the features has	1
one other plus is that napster supports this device via their software	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we this router for our two computers	0
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after a few moments	0

now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the end of the day what wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
excellent phone phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1

well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line the other hand was very helpful	1
the possibilities with auto manual and mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access use	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1

bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to the ability to external flash and lense filters choices	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
ring tones only come crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
overall sweet machine	1
the woofer is much larger	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
that is a rare and valuable	1
for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
it is more than days and it does not the picture no what do	0
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1

i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday i m extremely pleased with it	1
link support was polite and tried to help but worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
performs well but i love having the scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond many situations in which i actually seek to use the camera	1

also the carrying that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have open it up to the display	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
this small size speaker system out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
they are not wowable good	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through process without a problem	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not bass which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
because this camera is beautiful	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what are looking for is good in a small package	1
especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
both the black and the white speakers are and worth it	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1

i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or alkaline backup those emergency pics you have to have	1
has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use which is somewhat of a disappointment	0

recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
bottom line is the price these things sound great and	1
again were spot on and projected from where should the front of the tv	1
i have yet to try all of the adjustment options priority aperature adjustments but all controls are well thought out and the manual relatively clear	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1

it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
i am absolutely in awe camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1

reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
the range is so can blast it if you want	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
volume level is ok	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i to work from home due to heavy snow	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
the insult is that while this router comes useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the software from the internet then pay an to unlock all the features	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
you can also assign special people when they call	1

everything was great until it dropping internet connection sporadically	0

best electronic ve bought since i was born	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
great picture	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably overworked	0

ripping and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
very easy set	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
this router phenomenal	1
the grain was terrible	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
excellent range of metering options well	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i very happy with these ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
games kind stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
for the money apex machines have good features	1
great speakers overall	1
the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in with mb raw image files and noticed the difference rrb	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
the interface software itself which be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
this phone is great as a whole and is like others with one or two good qualities	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
images taken were so clear	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in or on a train	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are to use	1
in any case by artist album is ok however miss an ability to navigate folders	0
the controls are much inferior to	0

my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
second the system controls are poorly designed	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy use	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0
i followed the easy in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1

the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
these speakers are great	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have too	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
also can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists cds in alphabetical order	0
in any case navigation by artist is ok however i miss an to navigate by folders	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel it	1
this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1

no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made experience photography on a totally new level	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
mid range is nt best but it is certainly there enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
pc cable is too expensive a cable	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
speakerphone	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
the environmental audio however and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0

the sound quality has been poor since day one constantly calls there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer ac adapter with the base or it turns off	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective would be nice	0
the quality is except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	0
it easy beginners to use but has features that will love so it an excellent camera to grow into	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0

the light auto correction is awesome	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
came back working and i was momentarily that i d heard about acer tech support did turn out be true in my case	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
a system error problem	0

tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0

operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m but i was able to figure out most of just messing around with it at a camera store	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
it it is woth every penny	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1

fragile	0
is sound quality	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
meanwhile the instructions apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a of instructions and offered by way of explanation on installing for computers	0
my only complaint is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
avoid this model like the	0
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
i was worried that megapixel photos would more but there is no difference in working with the files	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
product is definitely worth the purchase	1

you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
the manual does a job filling in that remain	1
the ringtones included are awesome did i mention they were polyphonic	1
i had no problems at all so and i m very happy	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
in all i d say this a decent router for the money	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
was even worse than the which was now working fine	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0

this phone has a very useful feature the speakerphone	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
and really this is the best phone one	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
this product is the purchase	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse is stiff	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running keep it in your pocket	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1

this is i ve purchased	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor as any i ve seen	0

this was standard shipping service	0
the phone is is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss my is voice dialing	1

i am using in my office and they	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0

lastly i that the speakers were over priced what got lrb unless there in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
the auto setting does great job of time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1

navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have for as evolve	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
great speakers	1
if you re for opinion of the apex player i	1
for the price and size and features you can t the price	1
i trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
the price is very good	1
there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
flash as all built in flashes in small cameras you overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
you can be up to about feet away from it it still work perfectly	1
has the radio function which is	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i really notice it when the display is off in which case see own reflection on the screen	1
the sound quality but the can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
i would strongly recommend this product	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but durability was big zero	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on mouse pad is stiff	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
after nearly pictures i have that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
the camera is in a trip this past week i asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you one of the sub menu items and that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
this system is very powerful	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
door broke after a month	0
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
seems like a good product	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
the final insult is that while this router comes useful software to make sharing wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the pictures are fabulous and their a learning curve it there are tons features i have nt even gotten to	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
as it stands now the case is useless unless you re packing the player up for travel if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
from the supplier was exceptional	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the software repeatedly	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
bright visible screen	1
can do with it such as choose what kind of now interface can see the interface as modern or classical	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
the grain was terrible	0
the second lasted before the video went out	0
buttons the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
what the hell wrong	0
i have no complaints	1
i thought it just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the xtra sounds great with good headphone	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific point and shoot	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
overall an excellent phone	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
i highly recommend it	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
the apex a steady performer for me	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
transfer through windows explorer recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
having usb	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case be nice	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
while i the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an fm phone and earpiece	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is more than about feet away	1
i d venture to say that it the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls well at	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
i m with this product	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
the optical zoom works great and the x zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
user replaceable battery	1
i using jbl n ii as surround left right which is a very nice excellent speaker set	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
the only i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
simply this product was created was left behind	0
i had this for months now and i	0
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
worked from at which time the picture failed completely	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
i find it bright	1
i do nt for see myself any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
setup was very easy	1
sound though i can t really compare it to the ipod	0
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop i was sold	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
their network coverage is very sporadic the network always seems resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
even reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the creative is awkward difficult to use and just plain does on some computers	0
i t rate one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
i found using mediasource to load your to the nomad jukebox be easier and faster than windows explorer	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
you can manage your profile the contrast of make different of display either list or tabbed	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
anyway is a great and i really love it	1
i nt think really matters though i mean my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while and the picture was awesome	1
is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend to anyone out there	0
in fact others	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
same story as everybody else when to get service apex nothing	0
i quite my new speaker bar	1
windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
i did nt think i would find quality and ease of use for under i	0
the monitors were both good	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
you do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme can even make your own apps games	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
acer has awful to deal with they treat their customers like and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
if i were to rate speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m because i think the job that most people want them for	0
no problems dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a portable hard drive albeit one on which can create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i immediately problems getting to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
having unfilled id tags cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has i have nt even to all of them yet	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
despite the things that i have listed so far could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
audio is excellent	1
the customer support is very rude	0
i love the fact i can carry it and forget about it	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and it does run slower while multi tasking gaming experience is not compromised	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
the only have found with the internet service is that it does access mls very well at all	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq a limited band eq	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless when using my home cable modem as input	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
it nt have firewire a real complaint since most windows users nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
well the theory was but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
image quality	1
x zoom is nice	1
about the time it can t find the device i attach it to my pc	0
typically the is the headphone jack it was me and many others	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and if we keep trying something will work when it did not work	0
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone has already come loose	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
our special friends at creative gave this good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
overall i would reccomend to who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
kudos apple though your products are superb quality your support is equal	1
like other reviewers installation was	1
fine	1
i fully it go bad again or some other in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
are razor sharp even in macro	1
has a type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
so easy to set up had some problems	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
what is added in functionality detracts in as is prone to popping off	0
the first one we installed did work and our kids devastated to say the least	0
ordered this computer she is a teacher so she a small computer would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very with freeway noise	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
it has fm radio option and i listen to music anytime	1
update the finish more mirror than silver and i like it	1
to my a kbps wma file sounds just as good and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no update to support this product	1
the battery	1
of our disney movies do nt on this dvd player	0
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
this is the best phone i have seen	1
however if speed transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
and it works great too	1
takes	1
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
also you can store data on it which is for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
way can t go with this price	0
ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones this router i was very unimpressed	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
the movie clips taken always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
have this monitor a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
is fantastic	1
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
capacity	1
this camera also has a feel and to it	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
overall it the best camera on the market	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
i find all of the controls well placed not flimsy in the least	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
to contact their customer service	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
over for the price this is a good unit	1
the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
fragile	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt with mp s the list goes on and on	0
very simple to use	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
it came well packaged	1
the sound clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing up	1
very simple to use	1
it has good color and price was great	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
the replacement was even worse than the one which was now working fine	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
i have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a version you have to the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
there limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of built in speaker crossovers	0
the that covered kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
recieved in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
they great sound when hooked up and receiving a signal	1
but canon never	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
but then again the ringer can be that i heard ringing inside my office when i already out on the street	1
also for some reason the picture washed on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the front cover pop off easily but i always have mine in the case i did nt notice after first day	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
a system error problem days after purchase	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
is even more pleased due its widescreen	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but e mail address	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
all other buttons pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
i m not easily impressed electronics to be a little conservative this product really deserves stars	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
transfers quick through usb	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
the sounds were the movie directors intended	0
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i asked to take a picture a vacationing	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd ipod nano	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
d link dir extreme n wireless router fine as a n wireless router	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
they will not respond to my emails the phone is constantly busy	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
this thing is trash	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so it has been excellent	1
is it could nt be easier to use	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
range was or possibly slightly worse the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
picture is excellent	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
i have stored around cd is on this and barely touched	1
the interface was several elements simply did nt work at all	0
takes excellent photos	1
when i turned the phone on the first that hit me is how good the screen is	1
has happened with several different dvd is occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from distance	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the lcd than the previous model the nx has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
user replaceable	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or sticks	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
unfortunately player would not read any of region one dvds even though they were damaged in any way	0
the is a very durable compact package and find to be a brand that i can trust	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this not to the zen it applies to all the company products	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life lower price i found both	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
even better with the optional headset you listen to music over the integrated radio	1
portable	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
minor complaints though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in is unavailable	0
average indoor shots with a flash not quite as good as mm	0
video output stopped workin	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
this play is basicly junk	0
i dissapointed that acer was nt more	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use works great for me many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
maybe it my lack of experience but found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that i gave all the information i could	0
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
the explorer program did shut down a times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer anything open up explorer again	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows camera to focus in low light	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust what have though notmad may still work better	1
if have netbook expectations will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
it is also a bigger than expected that is ok because is something to work with my iphone	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
it is easy	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be at all	0
this router the best i have used to date	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
the subwoofer is and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so it does nt that big of a disturbance	1
it has good color and price great	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some company to unlock all the features	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has on screen manual mode would be really helpful if shooting that is tough to automatically focus	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i have it for a now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen the image still looked normal	0
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
only con i can think of is	0
i am using jbl n ii as left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
is phenomenal	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and to find what you re looking for	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
the price is good	1
took me a few tries to but it is very user friendly player imo	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
summary i love this camera and would heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the monitors were both good	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
sub woofer is large	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
short if you re someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great you	1

overall i like it	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
it is versatile and seems to be of the best	1

is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
it small light and nice looking and is decent as well	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored s	1
with gb of storage i have about songs the with about more	1
at the end of the day what i a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity features easily meets those criteria	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
is beautiful	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn	0

great colors and white balance	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1

silverish color really adds a special touch	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for last couple to few months i have had it	1
is ok to rip burn you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch rip my cds i bought the zen and guess what	0
they deliver great sound when up and actually receiving a signal	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity unmatched	1
the shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i think this it biggest flaw	0
maybe it is my lack experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
sound quality	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
size bigger than the ipod	0
you can your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
can be a problem for older downloaded music files with	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
did managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	1
very functional and i use it in very audible	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
just an average user getting value in this product	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i	0
the switch negotiated the speed just and presented the router with a gige link	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its light and feel so comfy with it	1
i nt had time to push this player the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory should be expected from creative labs	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
has many other features ir just to name one the features above view as the most beneficial	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small computer and a lapdesk and external speakers	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
the buttons on the phone small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
with this mp player you get much more for much less than an ipod	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
i would have rated it for the poor manual	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
poor visibility on the keys	0
i would be inclined to purchase an apex product again	1
what a disappointment	0

i tried called apex cust service help	0
i have not any distortion problems with this phone and am more with this phone than any i ve used before	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
the link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it the cds in alphabetical order	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
the eax features are pretty as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
however for a budget i this camera is an excellent choice	1
cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock at odd times	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
i get complete coverage in my house lrb sq ft rrb and it is in the corner of my basement	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last by far not least received is stamp of approval	1
creative mediasource software ok to catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before bought the zen and guess what	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
i have it for a week now and camera has exceeded my expectations	1
there is no speaker grill to any protection to driver	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
if you have netbook expectations will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
battery life the drawback to digital to quote	1
it is so small but big	1
overall i giving this stars i ve seen of the problems have repeatedly cried havoc over but i ve had the player a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
great camera great investment	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was in a reasonable amount of and guided me through the process without a problem	1
cocking the shutter halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what experienced	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
for a price is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get and the best it works as great as it was advertised to then some	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
i selected the away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
the sound surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1

storage capacity	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
to my ears kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
apparently mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
the sound this slim design puts out	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite	0
to my amazement even that was error prone	0
is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
it has a nice color screen	1
and it works great too	1
tech support was very pleasent and once you actually got someone	1

the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
i recently the canon powershot and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1

it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
the software	1
the sound quality is very good	1
screen was good easy to read	1
the sound that from that little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1

first the zen lets you sync	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
i have been disappointed find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information	0
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll to select you have to push straight in or it	0
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
battery life is ok	1
contrary what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
what a	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
speakerphone	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1

depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
unlike some of the other people who a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
the labeling of firmware itself mystery and suggests that this company is just	0
as i the creative mediasource software actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume and simple selector buttons	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
the quality is superb	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the link is very easy to install and set up	1
contrary to what ive g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated from canon	1

i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
i giving this player cautious recommendation	1
minimal between less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
my only significant complaint is	0

even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
it does not have which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0

the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
mediasource did not install my personal notebook	0

with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
the i rated it a four is because that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best	1
only owned it about two weeks so i we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1

excellent range of metering options as	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc	1
build quality is top notch	1

the player hangs up on file transfer every once in while prompting a reset	0
my first impression was positive	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all usb drives attached to this wireless router to the actual local computer desktop portals and be to drop upload attach etc	1
t is does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing very good this is probably necessary	1
i highly recommend it	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
i love this player and am extremely happy with	1
the picture quality is and you can connect it to your tv and could silent movies that way if you to	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
with the smooth knob i find hard to judge if am actually gripping it and by feel alone	1
a fantastic very compact camera made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub the control station is too short	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and modes	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i ve also had the nomad zen	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1

on my main the software did not	0
anyways to the point i ve tried to be so calm the past month of dealing with and their terrible service and support	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when open the drive	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a clean look	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you	0
the is large and easily read	1
people have problems with the flip switch the bottom that the player cover has been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use as the case covers the switch	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
i limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
kind of bulky the wheel is but i can deal with that	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t some of your real dvds	0
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
there are to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
was looking for portability and good battery and this product delivers both	1
the ringtones included and did	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
both are very easy learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
if you want quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
although the nokia is a little short features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the more i work with the more i it	1
would not be inclined an apex product again	0
quite simply the firmware or the os that this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
looks fantastic	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
or maybe netgear up the firmware for this device that does know what to do	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
setup from in the box to completely working for preset stations was under minutes	1
i have used a few months and have had no problems	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i	1
also i can t understand why the does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
it has never worked	0
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
the dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
the screen is large and easily read	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit between shots	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
seemed like a good this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
without a i would say that have the same as the jbl and are portable lrb can be played without love that feature rrb	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
i have say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1

the sound this slim design puts out	1
i spent hours on that and i could connect to the internet	0
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in data folder	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but computer is incredible	1
after much frustration finally the firmware the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
second gripe in the or so months we our batch of of have already been for repair or replacement	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera can end your search with the nikon	1
for the price and features it is really good	1

is too small it took me like a half hour to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the pictures are razor sharp in macro	1
for the it is a well spent investment	1

price for all the features	1

this little camera has created a marriage and nikon knew i could love a digital camera so	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer like winamp with the options	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it a little bit	1

sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
like other reviewers was hell	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up	1
this unit was working fine for st month and a half then the color signal disappeared	0
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
the router has worked well	1
screen good easy to read	1
it is crystal clear	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i m delighted with this product	1
i am and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily up because i ve never seen anything better	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
the link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
you can move the range to almost anywhere in the scene with the of button and it has an on manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
there is a lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
but i have a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
but anyway the only thing you really look at here is the that the phone does have voice dialing	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
great camera and the price you can t beat it	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
i love this player	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
great good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where are in the menu order to select using the number keypad	0
screen was good easy to read	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
negotiated the speed just fine and the router with a gige link	1
the quality is superb	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even i love this phone	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
my dad has and it was another for the money	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
is superb	1
is easy enough to pop it to see what song you re listening to	1
for this is a good dvd player	1
billy joel was kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
playlists can made on the fly without aid of a computer you can use like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
however the creative software	1
unfortunately the player not read any of though they were not damaged in any way	0
will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
this system is very powerful	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
highly this monitor hard to beat at this price point	0
ve had it for about weeks it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
range functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are about photography	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are it in the palm of your hand	1
price gb of storage	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
portable	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the color screen is as are the polyphonic ringtones	0
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen	0
would recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a speaker system	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a player that can t do the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
so if you re game for little you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
weaknesses the feel and layout of the remote are so so it does the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
when you put this phone in pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
is good	1
in other words is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable albeit one on which can create folders or at worst a very lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
you crank a little to a a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
the software sucks	0
my house is so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	0
what me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
highly	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with than any other computer speakers ve owned	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on not just the computer	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
also it was to set up a route as the process exactly the same my old netgear	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
the menu options are uncreative as can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what re looking for	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts the software is very user friendly and it beautiful in it chrome casing	1
the and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not well when battery is low	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very simple	1
quite bulky and uses as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
i selected the right away have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
my dwl ap does not work a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the position	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches	1
what a junk	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
what a disappointment	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several a day and always got a busy signal	0
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos detail that challenges all of the mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on comes with last but by far not least fiance is stamp of approval	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
this little speaker dynamite sound	1
bought this set it and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving	1
but this camera is great	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic jvc players	1
pc is too expensive for a usb cable	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
i ve used the speakerphone for two hours and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is very quick and the quality is	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would give it up for anything	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing are very it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when are bored	1
it works great	1
shipping was fast and are very easy to set up	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
compared to in this this is most definately best bang for the buck	1
we got two phones the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken died after less two weeks of use	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
changing brightness easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when contaced support were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail line you just have a computer a laptop and will be fine and secure this router is well worth the money	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx player a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system categorizes based on i d tags and excellent sound	1
good battery life	1
the menus are easy to navigate are easy to use	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i m easily enlarging pictures with no visable loss picture quality and not using the best possible setting as yet	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and a shade of	0
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb but the wait was worth it	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
the pc side software can be goofy and getting used to it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
protective case completely as is it obscures display window	0
at am i called it quits and will be sending	0
i have ice age and it keeps me no disc	0
usb network storage it is slow	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors de focused text	0
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
i also did nt like the way displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
for the cost of this product i not ask for more	1
does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which real good	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
the g looks like a work of art	1
complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid controls can	1
but about is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
the sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
very good range and seemed to be better	1
other tagging problems result the nomad is operating system	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
the premium is good lrb do nt and user friendly	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
this was working fine for month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
are the sound people for computers can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
is no grill to any protection to the driver	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park ll glad you had the fm radio	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer if you know how to program jme even make your own apps games	1
this really is a great little phone got nice features great ergonomics and its tiny	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
it works great	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo but still has that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
this is probably one the few dvd players at that play almost everything throw at it	0
when the player was working it was great	0
battery life is ok	1
the main reason i am not satisfied with this product the fact that will lock up at odd times	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
one other issue is that the jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
they pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that and fortunately for me i owned a of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz	1
this my second creative labs player and it is definitely a fine product	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about photography	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor my purchase of over ipod	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
it slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
chose this one because from what i read it was the deal the	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
range of functions as above has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for are serious about	1
it came well packaged	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
i ve had the camera for two months i m even more pleased with it	1
also very light and portable	1
i would recommend this to anyone	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
multiple play modes in order is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
in it caused hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
for the price is a well spent	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
after with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
after months it playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
i called the tech support and helped me install new firmware but did	0
compact and portable just as described great sound quality	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1

i highly recommend it	1
cons think the satellites look	0
i tried to play three times with no success	0
i would not be to purchase an apex product again	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0

the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had of the songs	0
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
the colors and everything are great	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could get to work before anything but the dvd burner itself that had made the disc with	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the has the radio function which is utterly	0
now there one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
item shipped quickly was in good condition came with easy to use up disk we have nt had to re set the router at so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added benefits no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
lastly i feel the speakers were priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent in the label that i do nt know of rrb	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
software sucks hangs up but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
the backlight on phone and there is no way to change this	0
after multilple tries one of the disks video poor and features not available	0
broke after a month	0
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine	1
connection to the device is	1
games kind of stink and you ca download them you have get the link cable to get additional games	0
the battery life is amazing	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i am very with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking that great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it a phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was really fast	1
i it up only produced a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
i was to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to on a dvd but it also able to play vob files which i created	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature the person are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the storage capacity	1
great features	1
this router is phenomenal	1
heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend well into the rest of my furniture	0
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
at it is pretty light not as light as the ipod	1
it has lots little cute features my favorite being the games the pim and the radio	0
overall the g delivers must be considered the best image quality of from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
we purchased universal far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
the price there is nothing better	1
in addition it comes with sleek and powerful headset	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
battery life is very good i use it every day i have to charge it every or or so	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
this phone is good with a huge array features built into it	1
i ll start off saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
the prints are beautiful	1
even better you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i glad i decided to go with	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb what ever stupid size it rrb power adapter	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
for those who the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself be that it is advertised	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of kids playing with sparklers	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
know have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative only warrant it for days in itself is totally ridiculous	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
no games it has a cool screen not	0
sometimes system would hang so i have to restart the router then get going again	0
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
its far more to select songs easy to the fly playlist such as the new ipod not to mention it does sinc contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
i gave it only stars due to the that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
great features	1
drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
even on g band than the linksys	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the collection on the computer	1
canon is optics are better i their processing algorithms are also better	1
i m pleased with my zx here is a quick review	1
great camera	1
no propietary headset jack	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
what a disappointment	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
direct firewire to the camera	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
i m glad canon decided to keep mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i have not even my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
what i do nt like is at lower volume music listening tonal are very poor	0
the canon computer software to download sort upload and manage your digital on computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job it up	1
am impressed with this camera is to use	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the	1
i this connected to my late macbook pro and it	0
fact is could nt	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my ipod nano	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner my basement	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would been with the ipod	0
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
it is easy to use for a beginner like me but has of features for me to grow into	1
i am disappointed and elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of business traveler	0
so off i went get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can eax would introduce static	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
it was enough to remove the plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
you create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to and rip directly from cd to	1
this by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
this product is amazing	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable easy to use	1
the camera has a wonderful set features	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera are very intuitive	1
software is easy to use	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual the hard nor the cd version	0
does not enough volume when to or external receivers	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
well was nice while it lasted	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based d tags and excellent sound	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device you	1
the replacement unit had a problem the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly it impossible to select among in my area	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
i find it too bright	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1

the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough people to see	1
it makes for this by being extremely easy to with well laid out controls that can be	1

with it enabled anytime we made changes to we had to manually the on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0

usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0

price of storage	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is because these are computer speakers	0

i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0

it would spin more and then show that there was no disc	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1

the sound pretty good also lrb although not anything a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality and an unbeatable price	1

frame freezes and the family dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0

this happened with different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	1
have yet to using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments but all are well thought out and	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1

although the nokia is a little the features department it an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
it is scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1

minimal pause between songs less good achievement for a drive based player	0
key instead	0

i m very pleased with my zx here is a quick review	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes downloading graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this were blurry and a shade of orange	0
you re need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
however it does not play windows media and i not get it any of my divx rips	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0

after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
the woofer is much larger	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
best in class sound	1
propietary headset jack	0
it sounds great out on the patio on my night stand	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0

while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
both the and white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1

at the end day what i was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
it has one is that songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0

very bad	0
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
software is easy use	1
did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
when i tried to the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
the software quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
this system is very powerful	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
picture quality is	1
video output stopped workin	0
quite bulky and uses a although not very as is contructed mostly of plastic	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1

it is easy	1
not play relies on i d no fm or recording	0
tried to play three times with no success	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
in all d say this is a decent router for the money	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
this phone has many other features ir just name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
have used it frequently and had no problems	1

no dead pixels on mine	1
the second set is working just fine	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
very good value for the money	1

the software on the router is pretty good	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone excellent	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as rrb i returned the item and a linksys dsl modem instead	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
i now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
this is an excellent value	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
main dial is not backlit	0
is good	1
very bad quality	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it still work perfectly	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1

if you are not picky about image quality go it	0
this wonderful product was	1
i have it for a week now this has exceeded my expectations	1
would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
after and hearing the sound the i tour pop speaker i was	1
image	1
it wo play all of my movies	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
player works looks great you get the	1
