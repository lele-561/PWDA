the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the fm radio is cool	1

it would light just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
well it had good power but not much no precision at all	1
forget about the the game sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much mor is control panel ever now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the all my music and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much mor sound is much more acceptable	0

with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the case the side controls are reachable i have to open it up even to see the display	0
with the smooth knob turning it or not i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
the display is large enough it and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1

i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear try to anything overly extreme	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in box my older philips machine	1
the sound level the price is also not as high as i would have expected	0
need in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is expensive what i have	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services we believe greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the keys to success he said and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the color is red why the moon and is so attractive	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound be ignored which can t be stopped	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1

i m quite happy with my am new speaker bar	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and these work well	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
unfortunately i i bought a ps and bought a player because the ps could nt play play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
while my on a laptop laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers difficult making it harder to hear some audio	0
the fm radio app is cool	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
you can create playlists drag drop a playlist and songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect tried at wireless n speeds	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are the screen does not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size the only issues i have are minor the feel and layout of the remote control ar only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s not feel like a real remote control the screen does not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through ever with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0

the hard drive i had working sometimes and attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
only thing missing from creative is a player cd burner	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine got but was with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just really the computer	1
kind of bulky and the like it wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the same as the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
apple is size bigger than the ipod	0

the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
for the price price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery charge the camera is very good lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and the battery lasts it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time with a lot of people around the pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
this the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i found the songs and add them using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
got a system error problem it days after purchase	0
second the automatic sync on creative lets content on your phone you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
creating playlists using the help with this included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
is this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
vocalist this little speaker has dynamite sound	1

the screen is an old screen easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
better but this camera is great	1
as a whole the dvd very good player has a sleek design and works fine	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when works you are bored	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge great to be able plus	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with i was able to connect to a gige link	1

creative labs customer support website http www creativelabs com is useless	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design well and works fine	1
if you are then go not picky about image quality go for it	0
after we discovered the problems phones we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support phone number is busy always busy and they do not answer their web customer support telephone number is busy always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
the zoom goes up and down in makes it difficult to see what you are looking at at mos magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way screen is very small and the way it moves up and down in makes it difficult to see what you are looking at at all the screen does have magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size abou down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the software enclosed software i did drivers for the receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
in short if you re just someone not that is a little afraid of technology and you just not have to sit want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia the headphone jack so standard headphones will not work	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but much i only use it for occasional use backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
say they look fantastic	1
i did yet not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
after nearly pictures to say i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
the black fly wheel too feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
also a lot for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
support material is on the cheap side	0
been able to get ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i oh have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
small print size	1
beautiful home theater and clear with well and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
samsung galaxy s has got a system error problem days after purchase	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
headphones suck i would invest in a new pair some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i see have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation very little information about the installation and which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
it a also has unproven battery life	0
if you are the not picky about image quality go for it	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is are not the best a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	0
the rate plans are also very good at the moment least for me	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
reviews for the game sound quality are generally positive	1
this really is a great little phone very well made and very its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you think this is the best dvd player you can get for the pric can get for the price	1
setup it was very easy	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is agree a very limited vertical viewing angle in order get a good contrast ratio and to get consistent contrast	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run that i can t use at worst a very expensive one on which i can s create folders or at worst an expensive lesson i be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from worst again	0
then my dvds would stop playing in would just the middle or not even be read at all	0
scroll button down switch	0
software the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied i think with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
here is the brief synopsis the full phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i tried e mailing apex didnt respond and they come back saying undeliverable	0
playing it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
also lightweight very light and portable	1
i was impressed all fell apart by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
when it works its fine but i have works gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a very good card a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i m sure what to do not very happy with this machine or acer	0
customer service ability and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
now that i have all my not music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when i used using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i paired this very easily to can do two different android phones	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i have to say i m also impressed pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on the dvd player and the way it handles cd rs dvds	1
i dont know who no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and marks for an unbeatable price	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day the results of this forecaster	1
this sound quality and base is amazing	1
setup instructions was very easy	1

overall what a sweet machine	1
i easier found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the fm radio is a radio station cool	1
matter you can this level not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
reviews reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
think that i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
not it is small	1
one bad thing is that it is useless comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
i am very i thought the price happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
very easy to set easy up	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it give stars to is a good idea in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
sharp featured image	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
it is to use and easy easy enough for my grandmother to use	1

setup software for my application i found found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
im no dead pixels on mine	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker good choice for an set	1
i love the not have to worry fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users use firewire and most of them do not even have firewires themselve do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
very good for the price it is a well spent investment	1
it does not have an auto feature but it does have auto focus which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low traffi or low light conditionsit does have a focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	1
it is worth a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
in fact each of my creative mp players to make it work had software problem in the first place	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we go back and had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the turn it on we had to use router because the gui one would nt work	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts listen in an intimate setting	1
and it working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
well it was fun nice while it lasted	1
however i never my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	1
unfortunately after a message saying im loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
this a list is an excellent value	1

operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz home but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around able with it at a camera store	1
failed and unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
of the menus one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even not the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say nt difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i find the lack of entertaining games in this game on this phone quite disturbing	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and video freezes and eventually shows no footage of the event eventually shows no disc	0
size extremely small and convenient pocket or purse will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
this phone the fact that won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
best best in class sound	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to put the customer experience stand behind them	0

i am disappointed and looking a better product elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
material is on the cheap side	0

the software my computer mediasource can not work on my pc	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time ample when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my liking the player have it it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my liking the player has its quirk and turn it on again which own quirks and glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my liking is not to my likings	0

for the price it costs is a well spent investment	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way could the battery could be inserted	1

the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard hard to turn so you can for the dial t get an accurate adjustment	0
i am happy and really have no complaints over this unit	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player device in my opinion and does nt support a folder stucture	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re going to be loading packing the player up for travel or if that it s not worth it you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the quality of communication setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0

the apex has been a steady this year performer for me	1
then my dvds would stop playing after a few minutes in the middle or not even be read at all	0
they sound they really good just as the reviews say	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good music have a great review of sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1

i m not very happy with this am machine or acer	0
small size	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i chose this one because from what i read me it was the best deal for the money	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
even viewed i have cds full of jpgs	1
for the price investment it is a well spent investment	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1

i paired this very easily this to two different android phones	1
to my amazement even that process but was error prone	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable the only thing i could find in my older philips machine	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume and this makes on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it of the speakers harder to hear some audio	0
this system is very powerful powerful	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i have liked would have liked	0
some features in the user interface	0
very convenient to scroll in menu work from etc	1

the on off button feels somewhat flimsy turn off the camerathe on off button feels like its and has an awkward tiny little lock out button hole in the middlethe that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
ooh and i it broke but dropped it and didnt break it it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for have the bundled nomad explorer software	0

awesome sound system	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up with the mouse down or tilt feature rrb	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and deal wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
setup software for my application i the software found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over in a good location my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity data you need for your music collection	0

but if controls you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
