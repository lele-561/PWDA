picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1

i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
of torture in the hands of t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can almost everything you at it	1

canon is g does it consistently	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs monitor was at my door by the time i got home tuesday	1

its far heavier and much larger might seem to matter if you use it or keep it in your pocket	0
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the sound quality is very good	1
the first routers worked good years	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
this player to work fine with everything else	1
the woofer is much larger	1
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
on the up side amazing battery life	1
however the creative software	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
pumps out great sounds with including	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
very pleased with its quality and durability	1
great features	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
the sound surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the customer support is very	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
i chose this one because from what i read it the best deal for the money	1
premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the monitors were both good	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
this system is very powerful	1
surprisingly everything seems work well	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
from the supplier was exceptional	1
usb means fast data transfers	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i been extremely impressed and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
this router does drop every once a while but not like the old did every hour or so	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i got it today it works great great sound i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i recommend this tower	1
has a type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i selected the right away and have gotten every time	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their line is always busy	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill files	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
its ability to as a back up for my music collection is huge plus	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
key instead	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
it plays basically every media i ve so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago the rental dvd that could nt played on my old sharp player	1
a week out the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
video output stopped workin	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order get consistent contrast	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
player a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
i only and that is the mb card included	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
this camera is to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
well it had good power precision at all	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the second set is working just fine	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
is a very durable compact package and i find to be a brand that i can trust	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very look	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
very long lasting battery life	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
it is the best camera on the market	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i was to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to on a dvd but it also able to play vob files which i created	0
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
if you want to a cd title that will frustrated quite quickly	0
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you everything configured	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
very good value for the money	1
overall i like the unit	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
it a heavier and casing	0
i have nt had time really push player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as be expected from creative labs	1
i took with this new product and pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid that is the price current of the art	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
unlike some of the other people who my dvd player came in perfect working condition	0
this little camera has created a marriage never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the controls are much to the simple ipod ones	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
the image quality is excellent	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
tag editing is a strong point as well	1
screen was good easy to read	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
i m delighted with this product	1
the manual does a job filling in that remain	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
sound quality is good	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
i fully it go bad again or some other in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
and the body construction has a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft the s	0
have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
by the shutter and getting the ready to shoot i was able to produce contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
do nt buy this player	0
it play was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
phone i d buy another	0

i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
on dvds so far it to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	1
door broke after a month	0
i it up only produced a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
the excels a cell phone thank god	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
you have some good customization options the as well	1
will in your pocket and not bother you	1
d link dir extreme n wireless router fine as a n wireless router	0
the changing colors help with a quick glance	1
the came from my video card	0
the software	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
for the money have good features	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
there are so many functions in this little camera	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
player works looks great you get the	1
that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and wise zens are unbeatable	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
i personally would recommend this router in house hold or small buisiness environmnets	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
this is a great camera for you	1
the appearance is okayed	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
pc cable is too expensive a cable	0
portable	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and nt come the overused blue	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
is too small it took me like a half hour to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0

fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
sub woofer is large	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
camera a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
however since i am in an office i keep them at a pretty low volume at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
it is worth it	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
great sound battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
even viewed cds full jpgs	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
the remote is and awkward to use	0
it also excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect against any damage	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
i bought this from computer direct ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
when player was working it but	0
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and choices	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone ve ever had	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the size is small	1
great value gb gb ipod for the price	1
we two phones for the t mobile family plan and came with a broken headphone and one today after less than two weeks of use	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
huge storage space even at kbs you store a ton of songs on this thing	1
for instance i made back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and plays the dvds	1
and it sooooo much music and audio files	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
the software which comes player is not good at all	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but is a learning for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating they just	0
super easy	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
is very good and are bright and even changeable	1
but went to it again there was sound but no picture	0
lastly i that the speakers were over priced what got lrb unless there in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
the controls on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when hold the	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
images taken were so clear	1
great quality picture and features	1
the poor design continues with the case	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it adjust the equalizer for you can be a big hassle	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
great camera great investment	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
the software is not good either the driver has working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
delivery was prompt	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it and there is no delay between songs	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
it the usb interface on the router to be either for nas or print server	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the grain was terrible	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
what the hell wrong	0
very easy set up	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the price performance looked just right	1
it is worth it	1
do nt know what other people saying but the software is awesome	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
it came well packaged	1
it is easy	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
well within days the video quit working	0
great colors pictures and white balance	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this an average of per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt with mp s the list goes on and on	0
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
i ve it for about weeks and is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and worked for the last couple to few months i had it	0
i this player	1
again were spot on and projected from where should the front of the tv	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the only thing i m the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
compact and portable just as described great sound quality	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
this far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and am disapointed	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
i did ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
still i willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
it has a few inconveniences is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
also for some reason the picture washed on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when contaced support were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail line you just have a computer a laptop and will be fine and secure this router is well worth the money	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park ll glad you had the fm radio	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be to zoom and review pictures	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
also the feature automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
p s the remote control does seem to confused times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
would not be inclined an apex product again	0
at i called it quits and will sending this awful deceptive product back	0
i like the automatic key lock function	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a so could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
of the g gives better picture quality low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews said it was slow	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
fm receiver it none	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
it is great to switch to spot metering actually it working on the lcd screen	1
first of all my calls were and clear unlike with sprint	1
the pretty good also although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	0
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
what a disappointment	0
have used it frequently have had no problems	1
have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
the operation with the increased memory option was with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter and nobody mention this	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the sound this slim design puts out	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
it is extremely light dissapears in your pocket	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
have been ripping songs into it for the past weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
it worked from to at which time the picture	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts both were bad	0
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
avoid this like the plague	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
scroll button switch	0
they are not wowable good	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
now there one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
in short you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is for you	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but in that this is because different less expensive not necessarily inferior technology is used	1
i love this player	1
it has never worked	0
is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
the quality is superb	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
it is so small but big value mac	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
i thought it was just the player but i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i guess limited lifetime warranty means it may a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
all in all this a great player blows the i away with easy to features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
the software was great as long as have an adminstrative user	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly the camera using the included transfer cable	0
for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to	0
had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is eax feature	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
we ve purchased universal so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
it is clear	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro it works flawlessly	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and all play great	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
battery life the drawback to digital to quote	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
great price	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
this is a very light phone a little less than with long battery life	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
i have it a week now and has exceeded my expectations	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
slr like programming and gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
works super easy	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the router has worked well	1
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d tag data from the cdds service the process to populate the year field	0
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
only so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of very soon	0
it is easy to use and very feature rich	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
on indoor shots with a flash are not as as mm	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0
they to yet it is weeks without	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the collection on the computer	1
find the apex ad to be a buy	1
main dial is not backlit	0
unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually no disc	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
in all i say this a decent for the money	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
it is	1
the toggle button that is to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
d link does provide mac support however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and not think justify the huge difference in price	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
chic look and good build the player comes a metal face plate	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
hooked up to the d link extreme n speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you end with the nikon	1
the cover came with it did nt fit very well	0
bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
this is a great camera for you	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
folders can not created for the audio files	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
there is no way the battery supplied	0
i would have rated it five stars but the poor manual	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
the movie clips taken always have some noise in can t avoid that	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
looks like a work of art	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
transfers quick through usb	1
no games it has a cool screen not	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
very range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
range was or possibly slightly worse the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i got this for use on my truck and m happy with it for the most it is loud and super to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
while there are flaws with the machine xtra gets five stars of its	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
loved the slim design	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
for the it is a well spent investment	1
the sound is but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
it was enough to remove the plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player	1
however when i plugged it my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
what a	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
all in all this is a very good option anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
this router is phenomenal	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
some movies it played yesterday wo nt play today	0
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking that great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i called apex is support number numerous but it just kept ringing	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized video was poor and features not available	0
the camera has a wonderful set features	1
way can t go with this price	0
the storage capacity is great for me	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
for this is a good dvd player	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
i wished that could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
the only things found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone is too	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
the grain was terrible	0
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
the storage capacity	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
the quality is really good	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound as the on stage and are truly portable lrb can played without power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
the other day was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
it will only move to side lrb down or tilt feature	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
this phone is good with a huge array features built into it	1
you adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt of a disturbance	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
it is small	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines excellent grip are than any other camera i ve seen	1
battery life	0
focusing on a display rack a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera blurry and in a shade of orange	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
have yet to using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments but all are well thought out and	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
it is made of plastic	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
and far not had problems dvds not being able to play	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
the player plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not a dvd stopping a particular point a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
excellent polyphonic ringing tones very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have of good bass	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
having spent considerable time with video i find annoying	0
also it was only with shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the is great upstairs downstairs outside in a basement four bars all the time	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
i t rate one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
link support was polite and tried to help but worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
because of it is hidden i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
small size	1
t which does not work along several long stretches on same route	1
audio is excellent	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was great value	1
unfortunately the player not read any of though they were not damaged in any way	0
the netbook work as a breeze for my it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
i tried called apex cust service help	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
works great	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells about the quality of their products and their to stand behind them	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there be some sort in the base we can no longer the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
for the there nothing better	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
slow gui be to wait seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
while i the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an fm phone and earpiece	1
so far the router has worked well	1
the memory is staggering	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource you can listen as they directly from the xtra	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
the prints are beautiful	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac macbook online	1
is the most bang for the buck out there	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
but about of dvd i ve played on ithave when watching the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
great speakers overall	1
overall the g delivers must be considered the best image quality of from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
as a portable player it should feel bit more durable	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
good battery life	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
took me a few tries to but it is very user friendly player imo	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
it has a nice color screen	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
without any at all if the exposure is the colors are as realistic i ve ever seen produced by film and this is raw image	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and i have open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or the sound is much more acceptable	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
this phone is a winner	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry what you is what get	1
no matter the format	1
lots of flaws exceptional sound quality hd size and make it a good buy	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music to play as left it when you were turning it off	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
overall i like it	1
no sells mm x mm sized lrb or ever stupid size is rrb power adapter	0
the fm radio is cool	1
i really love this netbook	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
after discovered the tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is busy and they do answer their web customer support	0
however you do get what you for in reliable products	1
awesome sound system	1
message was answered	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take unbelievably close the subject	1
another point of note the battery is	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
for the price and features it is really good	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
the keypad is a decent size the power on off key	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i love the quality	1
nice machines but i consider quality pretty low now	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1

the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when can instantly delete pics you do nt like that not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
some people problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp taking all the extra steps would be far	0

i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are going to be in a regular setting	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1

my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my ipod nano	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
i avoid horns but i nt hear anything overly extreme	0
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
ripping the songs even with is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
i am and looking elsewhere for that can withstand the rigor	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
great camera	1
best in class sound	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds the side speakers like did with my old front speakers	1
the problems came from my video card	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
i had this for months now and i	0

this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the volume	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since s not you are buying it for	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
get to chapter and everything freezes	0
i give it a rating stars	1
nt play a lot of discs	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
there is also no height adjustability it very low to the desk	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
have had the player since xmass love it	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it turning it by feel alone	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
i love this feature	1
are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
volume level is ok	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
i know will problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will worth it since will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
picture is excellent	1
is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
well was great but upon enabling the guest network stopped working	0
i did buy a week ago found that a vast improvement	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone has already come loose	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
all the latest stuff is top notch	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
my two main requirements longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
all other pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
the battery life is amazing	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
what a junk	0
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
remain extremely pleased with this router	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is and you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of my i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
i love this monitor	1
some features in the user interface	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
overall i giving this stars i ve seen of the problems have repeatedly cried havoc over but i ve had the player a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful you have little children around and you can always take with you and take many pictures of them	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
and are perfect for my needs	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
portable	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
i ve also had the nomad zen	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
the interface software itself which be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
battery life hours beats ipod is	0
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is of	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen than the nx is green backlight did	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be at all	0
both dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter the player kept going	0
i did nt want one in which i have to put in batteries myself that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
newbies will the full auto setting will them perfect pictures out of the box	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
nice little phone light compact	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i tried calling the support number a several a day always got a busy signal	0
sharp image	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a signal from the machine	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
megapixels is for anybody and the photo quality	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
i can see a drastic difference between this and dell in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
i thought the software was decent enough it nt complicated to learn at all	1
i m this player cautious recommendation	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming matter how you tweak the levels	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
these speakers are great	1
i am using them in my office and they generally	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
the price is very good	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
weaknesses the feel and layout of the remote control are only so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
also has a nice guest feature your visitors can separate of your primary link	1
my only complaint that cord is not long enough	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
if you are not picky about image go for it	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer effective in organizing your collection and is to a good cddb service	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
some features in the user interface	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
you can move the range to almost anywhere in the scene with the of button and it has an on manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
they look fantastic	1
this phone has many other features ir just name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
the is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
the speaker phone is very functional and use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
i bought my canon about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
one good it is gb of disk space	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
the quality is superb	1
house is small so it is hard to the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house worked in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	0
i ve now had the camera for and i more pleased with it	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just nt	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
paid amazon is this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to kills it for me	0
doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
i do nt for myself having any issues in however if i do i that with this product it will taken care of for free and quick with helpful and customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
i got this for christmas and it is great gift	1
well it was nice it lasted	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
with i found no use the bundled nomad explorer software	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was size it fits nicely into any pocket falling	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
great price for all the features	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
the backlight will periodically fail first time it happened i it in for warranty repair	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
second the system controls are poorly designed	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
product is amazing	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
i the nomad is color better but it	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
at the end day what i was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features are comparable to even the ipod	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
seriously i love it	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
sub woofer is large	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
volume	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the plus this makes for a great product	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
progressive scan for a relatively low price	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is to use	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
screen brightness is really good	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far it is delivery so my is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend one now	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
it is easy enough to for a beginner like but it has plenty of features me to grow into	1
it is easy	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a excellent set	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
otherwise this player is awesome	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the i paid	1
brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
for of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the colors and everything are great	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has excellent	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
it has unproven battery life	0
working hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i simply love this feature	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume and simple selector buttons	1
easy to	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical does	1
will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
you can be up to about feet away from it it still work perfectly	1
setup was very easy	1
i have had mine for a month now and to i enjoyed it	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
i chose the g because of its for very high quality clean images	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
i love the fact i can carry it and forget about it	1
small size	1
this has so many capabilities that you always have for new technologies as they evolve	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
user replaceable	1
typically problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
the apex has been a steady for me	1
the sound clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
this really is a great little phone got nice features great ergonomics and its tiny	1
there is much which has been said other reviews about the features of this it is a great phone mine worked without right out the box	0
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the second set is working just fine	1
nt been hassle for me at all	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0

now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering scroll great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton deals on here	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the sound produced by the nomad	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1

the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness cause you to miss precious shots	0

this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
these speakers have sound but they will buzz if you them on	1

about the time it can find when i attach it to my pc	0
it is light enough to around all day without bother	1
very bad	0
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
only con i can think of is no camera	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
the standard battery with is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
in any case navigation by artist is ok however i miss an to navigate by folders	0
definitely more capable of filling the room than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is really robust what others have said though notmad may work better	1
should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1

the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0

i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
only thing missing from creative is cd	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
it would spin more and then show that there was no disc	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
also can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists cds in alphabetical order	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
i am and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily up because i ve never seen anything better	1
bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load onto this	1
like other reviewers installation was	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
the menu options are uncreative as can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
even better with the optional headset you listen to music over the integrated radio	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
fragile	0
great overall	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
not only is it but its a better player for windows is what i have	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for fm stations was under minutes	1
fixed speaker cable do	0
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
it does not have which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
great camera	1
picture quality is excellent	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
when i took outdoor photos with of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
and the sound well there no complaints that	1
material is on the cheap side	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
highly recommended otherwise	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some company to unlock all the features	1

i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
otherwise a very monitor for its price	0
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered or on a train	1
good looks	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not bass which you would need a huge subwoofer	1

the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0

my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would her from bringing work home	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1

i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1

is great	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1

this camera is great	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
delivery was prompt	1
excellent range of metering options well	1
at ounces is pretty light but as the ipod	1
in addition it comes with sleek and powerful headset	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
that is a rare and valuable	1
great phone	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
the device itself	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
first a tad bulky not most asthetic looking and does nt support a folder stucture	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
seems to read most fine and reads quietly	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
speakerphone	1
gb	1
software the software is	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve there are tons of features i have even gotten to	1
it gives great pictures are easy to use the battery lasts the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
is the best phone i have seen	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
the only two minor issues have with the camera are the lens cap and	0
had problems setting up and my favorite cd transferred	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
after years with that carrier expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
due to the lack support for and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the monitor works with a sharp and bright display	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
only con i can think of is	0
simply this product was created was left behind	0
i was surprised how good the sound and i especially like to use it when i am listening to books	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
navigation could be better but there is nt anything the zen xtra can t do once you gotten comfortable with it	0
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there any	1
this means that is a good chance this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
its focusing system is very flexible	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
the setup process for the nomad is and the interface with the player sub par	0
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an tiny little lock out that needs to be depressed to turn the camera	0
sound quality is wonderful i like the smart volume sound normalization	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
the software sucks	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the where was to reset it and my computer far too often in order reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
i gave it only stars due to fact the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
lrb yeah like you ll a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl instead	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
the top that the battery poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
great phone i d buy another	1
the was the lowest seen in my research lrb office depot rrb	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
i put it to use for my daughter graduation the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the explorer program did shut down a times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer anything open up explorer again	0
not a bad monitor for but it is	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
however once you the volume a little to too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was fast	1
enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
after nearly pictures have that this nikon takes incredible	1
difficult to change for large number of tracks	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
easy enough but did not work	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
does not provide enough when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
storage capacity	1
propietary headset jack	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
the earbuds come with it are nt	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but is always display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen interferes with viewing at most settings	0
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
the price is very good	1
the picturers are amazing	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
fragile	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
overall an excellent phone	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
very simple to use	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less minutes	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
after and hearing the sound the i tour pop speaker i was	1
sound is excellent the battery life is the fact that the battery is replacable and the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
neither message was answered	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
software music match jukebox is nt the search funtion is fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
system was nowhere near and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very scene mode offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset	1
maybe it is my lack experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
one complaint the screen is too easily	0
i am enjoying my phone	1
i a player because the ps could nt play and now the player t play everything	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the main reason i am not satisfied with this product the fact that will lock up at odd times	0
even better you do nt have to worry about replacing batteries	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
the more i the more i love it	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it a little bit	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1

its far more to select songs easy to the fly playlist such as the new ipod not to mention it does sinc contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is in the corner of my basement	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
you can blame the bad chat support the repair technicians for that i gave all the information i could	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its light and feel so comfy with it	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
main dial is not backlit	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
this product is amazing	1
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
the other controls all very easy to use	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor my purchase of over ipod	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
do nt buy this player	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where are in the menu order to select using the number keypad	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1

this thing is i like to use it to pick up tough stains also listen to my old track records	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture various de focused text	0
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1

the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0

worked fine	1
while the ease of use i put off by the price about more than i paid amazon for this player	1

like it the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
great price for all features	1
mixed bag i but the price	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
transfer through windows explorer recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually to use the camera	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i looked into inexpensive player that had than standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it really annoying when it does because does it so often	0
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a mm headset jack	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
the build is top notch	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
range of functions as above has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for are serious about	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at to recharge the included ac adapter	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
the hard drive had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible not	0
one bad thing is it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash and for most purposes it is not enough	0
overall an excellent phone	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
the size is small	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
poor visibility on the keys	0
but it seems to work so that i do nt anticipate any problems	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
after hooking the thing i found that it would only played less than of the dvds put in it	0
this wonderful to for your first dvd player	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
the hangs file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
having access to so much music where go is terrific	1
others may have better luck but i never a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
this is extemely lame	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
the sound this slim design puts out	1
great quality and features	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
best support i have ever experienced	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia as it is the best in cellphones	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
battery is nice	1
vocals have as well	1
you re going to need to buy stock ones suck	0
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls can be learned quickly	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the replacable battery is great once it eventually wears out you will be to buy another easily	1
is a piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player is fact that the user replace the him herself by opening the lid and popping the new battery	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
the battery is nice	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
excellent picture quality on par my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the software quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the sites go into great depth in their reviews i am very pleased the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility and the functional conveniences this camera	1
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
the remote works but it does not work and are left standing there thinking you are doing something	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and it does run slower while multi tasking gaming experience is not compromised	0
size bigger than the ipod	0
size bigger than the ipod	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
great phone	1
recently bought this along a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m pixel fine combos and many the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you see pictures immediately	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
web cam is fairly good light in weight and elegant cons wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
router is phenomenal	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
we got on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
the sound quality is very good	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets is you can get different variations	0
screen brightness is really good	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
the sound came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
what a disappointment	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
the only complaint i have that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in it sticks	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1

the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
can be a problem for older downloaded music files with	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes shutting out	1
however a phone call to the d support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average not difficult to use or horrible	1

while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
good	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse is stiff	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when up with s connector	1
also it was very easy set up a route to my wamp server the process was as my old	1
in fact it caused my system hang more times not so i uninstalled it stuck with mediasource	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of of	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could get to work before anything but the dvd burner itself that had made the disc with	1
overall i like it	1
also can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i say i was surprised to see how small it was unwrapped the box	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
is bright easy see in the daylight with	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
i to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
this was working fine for month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does some getting	1
cons think the satellites look	0
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
however a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do for me and custom eq was a limited band eq	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
all in all suprisingly to use	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but computer is incredible	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
works flawlessly during installation cx	1
if i were to rate speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m because i think the job that most people want them for	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
easy to hook up	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does seem to read certain dvds	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
when you put this phone in pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	0
honestly i love this player	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
it worked great and we just	1
works great	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump of your tracks and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
color screen is good	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
this is extemely lame	0
volume level is ok	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
overall i the system features and performance	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather but only it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
and works great too	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line constantly busy	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
the problem with this box is that several times an hour if not more frequently	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
it has never worked	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you get in the states	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i recommend this product to anyone	1
first impression was positive	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at router is login there is setup wizard which will work with your os if you to use it	1
great camera great investment	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
price	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
my dwl ap does not work a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
my gut tells me the nomad in the long run be at best a gb hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
after much frustration finally the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
i spent hours on that and i could connect to the internet	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the pc sync feature superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i m it would and can be useful in a different setting where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
for a price that is still less than the lowest level ipod was able to get this gb monster the best part is it works as great as it advertised then some	1
software the software is crap	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has that serious photographers will so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
while i would of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
i m also running in insulated gauge speaker wire and stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through groove in the bottom of the base	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
was even worse than the which was now working fine	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the keys are close together and layout is funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
are very easy to use	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
support from is literally nonexistent	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
this camera has a great feel and weight to	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
not the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
no matter the format	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the canon g tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for to use	1
i sent my monitor acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
but this is in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
storage capacity	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
the phone has but because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with that you expected this phone to do	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy use	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free and downloadable java apps	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
the environmental audio however and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and satisfied the range of have there too	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
setup is simple it worked out of the box	0
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
other than that this thing is great	1
quite the firmware and or the that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
nice and compact	1
tried mailing and they come back saying undeliverable	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound outs	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the sound is excellent one would suspect from a creative product	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
for i still think its a great phone	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
after a lengthy and extensive for feature loaded high performance size i initially gravitated to this little gem of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
the sound quality excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means advantage	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
the colors everything are great	1
the phone is is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss my is voice dialing	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds i bought the zen and guess what	0
just this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
i could tell this a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
is	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
then the files is easy as pie	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change the panel when i look the center to the corner	0
about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature the person are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
it does well in all of internet browsing	1
the first one we installed did work and our kids devastated to say the least	0
the features are really cool like the radio	1
great price	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device you	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that and fortunately for me i owned a of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
my first impression was positive	1
scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
the build quality is top notch	1
best in class sound	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this	0
it is a fantastic and well worth the price	1
made call immediately by very helpful competent	1
cheap construction they should made the player out of hard plastic and put some the corners	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
i needed three batteries to myself going with the s but battery in the g a real powerhouse	1
what makes focus lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
they could be comfortable but no	1
so sit back relax and brag to your friends who paid a mountain for dvd player that can t half the things this one and for a fraction of the price	1
it takes approximately to seconds to lrb i have timed it rrb which nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
video output stopped workin	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
battery life is ok	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
i also did nt like the way displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
it is small	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
for those who the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
material is on the cheap side	0
for a small portable this allows you to listen to as well as share music and podcasts in intimate setting	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
so now it still everything you just can t it	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
the zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
it dvd is problems the other two being afflicted a number of	0
kind of bulky and wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	1
the reception and sound quality are	1
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
loved the slim design	1
the color screen makes this after rebates phone shine bright and commands	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
same story as everybody else when to get service apex nothing	0
anyways back to the i ve tried be so calm the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
am with how easy this camera is to use	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
however its x optical is for of the shots that i take	1
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not do nt know if it something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
this led monitor	1
for the price it a very nice dvd player	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience on a totally new level	1
this speaker the same wonders for my low end	1
good range speed	1
what really made this for me was the software	1
reviews sound quality are generally positive	1
this is an excellent value	1
screen was good easy to read	1
a there are with my menu knob	0
i found using mediasource to to the nomad jukebox be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the sound is amazing	1
software is easy use	1
no propietary headset jack	0
harmon international has done a great job on all the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
flash with flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at reasonable price there is no better camera period	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a bang for the buck	1
seriously i love it	1
when i tried to the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
please consider this much superior piece before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup those emergency pics have to have	1
the design and construction are excellent the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
