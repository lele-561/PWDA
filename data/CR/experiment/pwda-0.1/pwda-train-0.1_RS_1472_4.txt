sub woofer is large	1
the person hear you perfectly the other end of the call can on	1
did came turn working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support it nt back out to be true in my case	1
user replaceable battery	1
it did also seem to have a strong smell electronics new for some time	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
its far heavier and much larger which might in seem to it except if you use it while running or keep matter not your pocket	0
i m this monitor for a month now and i have very pleased with it	1
is extemely lame this	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best one albeit a gb portable hard drive on which i can t create folders or worst at a very expensive lesson to companies never in buy products from again	0
i m with canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it glad new technology	1
is sound quality the really good	1
creative understand the sound people for computers i can t are why eax would introduce static	1
the only two minor issues i have with the lens cap camera are the and the lens itself	0
chic look and good comes the player build in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
the problems came from my video card	0
when the player it working was was great but	0
the explorer program i anything down a couple times while did was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or shut just open up explorer again	0
solid resistant to scratches dissipation heat better	1
wo a lot of discs play nt	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
this the finest camera by far is in its price and category i have ever used	1

the viewfinder is scoying borderuer lcd	0
price wise zens i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and naturally are unbeatable	1

however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
gives canon g the tons of control for photo buffs but still has the auto mode that makes it very easy for an novice to use	1
i am very with its quality and durability pleased	1
for those of us that like i tinker to think creative offers some advantages	1
without a doubt i would speakers that these say have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can without a power outlet played be i love that feature rrb	1
amazon was wonderful about paying it up the next day and picking for the return shipping	1
shots was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing i of the kids playing with sparklers	1

ever camera best from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a x drive on my pentium pc with cd	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
in router if you re just that someone is a little afraid short technology and you just want a of to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the image quality is excellent	1
them have great sound but they will buzz if you leave these speakers on with the sound turned up	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
received apex dvd and the picture great was when set up with s connector	1
in short if you and just this router that is a little afraid of technology re you just get online a router to want do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day someone is great for you	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
the changing colors help tell to with a quick glance	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
most of my songs however is almost completely useless and has made the environmental audio sound worse than without it	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
in all d i say this is a decent router for the money	1
one phone is this of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
it has a few on a cd one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like inconveniences	0
i guess that a lifetime warranty means it may take limited lifetime to collect on the warranty	0

both units are similarly small with small speakers	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
overall and am very satisfied with this product i will be using it often	1

i quickly got to use to the interface and any find can song playlist etc fast enough	1
to are much more distinct squint i do nt have to strain my eyes and and when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had things do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
even better the the optional headset you can listen to music over with integrated radio	1

has nice thing is that the unit another both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not d in the literature i mentioned scanned before buying	1
huge storage space even at kbs a ton can store you of songs on this thing	1
any the g delivers what must be considered a best image quality of overall current megapixel digicams from the detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and unbelievably can take the pictures with the lens you close the subject	1
this different happened with it has dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when several did not work one time before	0
equipment included is average but is that nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
the quality of the pictures love i	1

jack propietary headset no	0
and the well sound there is no complaints about that	1
one complaint the screen is too scratched easily	0
the mount is easy to use up is just velcro straps to tie it on the handlebars	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since it s not what you are buying that for	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
possibly the biggest advantage this player herself is the fact that the user can replace the battery him has by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
operating its many features out i was but i m no annie lebovitz able to figure is easy and often obvious most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1

door a after broke month	0
the interface software itself was should be user friendly which anything but easy to use	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0

means fast data transfers usb	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects depth with being lost	0
to my ears a kbps wma file as just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra as just sounds good sounds a portable cd player	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
or maybe that so screwed up the firmware for this device netgear it does nt know what to do	0
the problems from my video card came	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which is me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra allows combination easily of price capacity and features meets those criteria	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
color the screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
insanely fast is usb transfer	0

conclusion i was ready to pay got them to return the speakers the day i the shipping	0
no way to contact their customer service	0

ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
but if a slr mm camera ve used you the controls are very intuitive	0
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
navigation could be better but there is nt once anything the zen xtra can t do really you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
forget about the sleek of if it can t play some looks your real dvds	0
in other words the zen you not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity is need for your music collection	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed on out s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
its reputation chose the g because of i for very high quality clean images	1
i cd stored around have is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
office starter web cam is also anything bad good light in weight you elegant cons i wo nt say fairly as and are just paying for this net book	0

the side view screen quality is very high the is very sharp clear	1
my friends the quality impressed with were of the pictures i took	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which of metrics all types converts	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
the second lasted about the video weeks before two went out	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and more indoor shots are about good provided that your subject is no the than very feet away	1
one other plus is that napster this supports now device via their software	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
then easy the files is sorting as pie	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
i did nt read a thing about how was operate it it to just intuitive	0

bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
unfortunately the player would not damaged in any way any of my region one dvds even though they were not read	0
there are many so functions in this little yet powerful camera	1

those i was willing to overlook still things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion it nt fast even when accessing is with the hotkey shortcut	0
bottom line is for the price these things and great sound have tons of good bass	1

does when provide enough volume not connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on asked this past week i was a recent trip to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and tiny an awkward has little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0

it can be up to about feet away from it and you will still work perfectly	1

i have tried customer service times to seem a hold of apex who does nt get to answer their emails and telephone number is is as the one lonely many rep constantly busy probably extremely overworked	0
i have had this player for months frustration have been able to see a total of dvd is after the and do aggrivation of getting the player to and it is job	0
it has lots of little cute features my favorite and the games being the pim and the radio	1
also navigating while playing music plus a is unlike my previous player	0
the scroll bar a bit of a pain is	0
this product normal use too fragile for is	0
i found it very useful large files transferring for to another computer	1
forget about the sleek looks if it t can play some of your real dvds	0
simple click buttons back buttons volume and access are very easy to read display and use	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
color screen is good	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative five this product really deserves but stars	1
quickly on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather the buttons	0
the keyboard connector upgrading the memory while broke	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally your image distorts	0
progressive scan player a for relatively low price	1
after several family of torture in the hands convert i am delighted to drop them and to forward look august when i will of at t customer service our other years phones from at t to t mobile	0
it had heavier and more sturdy a casing	0
stare too long screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright nt to read at night but dim enough so it does enough blind you when you the	1
only could we if get one camera in it	0
at first i still with this as mbps was dealt really fast	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
a winner phone is this	0
i which using jbl n ii as surround left right am is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
bass look fanatics at the s pii	1
in however phone call to the d link support crew was answered a a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
the player are also flawed is mechanics	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
the zoom goes up of the way most settings in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter and down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at down	0
this item made the purchase the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i was	1
to the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have also open display up to see the it	0
so yes as with all software bundled with was products it creative useless and ugly	0
from as everybody else when trying to get service same story apex nothing	0
it is easy to use and complete seems feature it	1

i like lock automatic key the function	1
mp is about right this camera the target market of for	1
one beef the is scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
the problem with that is this box it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
the many situations focus performs well but i love having auto optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to the in which i would actually seek to use the camera	0
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
would of buy again because nt the customer service	0
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is opening in that the user can replace the battery him herself by the the lid and popping fact the new battery	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
these speakers incredibly amazing are	1
only con i is think of can no camera	0

the from the player sound is ok	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems the dvd the others on on	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing with in auto mode a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
without any tweaking at this if the exposure is accurate the colors are as and as i ve ever seen produced by film realistic all is a raw image	1
had ve i this thing for less than a never treated it quite well month dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
to it because it looked easy selected install	1
in addition it only seems to work may you re about five feet away from the player although that that have been just the batteries if came with it	0
complete is easy to use and it seems feature it	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping without off much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
well flash of noise are never great and there was still a lot photos	0
still i overlook willing to was those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
stars give it a rating of i for looks	1
camera is a fantastic it and well worth the price	1

with gb of storage i have about songs with room for about more the player on	1
you ll be changing track information a lot the cd database information because utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1

it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another on a cd like	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on of video with lots s color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
main the reason however i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0

the zen stores be files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened data programs to or launched from its disk	0
the screen that has an extremely bright acer and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb monitor many screens will not fit in	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature find to out more just log on to canon is website	1
the speakers perform well very and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1

unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and to a miserable repair facility have match their products	0
was neither picture nor sound there	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level this on phone is especially quiet	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
as well in program id tag editing is a strong point the	1
so who back relax and brag to all your friends of the a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half paid things this one can and for a fraction sit the price	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
what nt do i like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0

fails to amaze canon never but	0
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the picture quality is amazing and you if connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way can you wanted to	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too the lrb computer i like to get done with some background music viola distracting audio is great for well this is relative great for a the work speaker rrb	1
computer do nt want to be a sensationalist but this i is incredible	1
very lasting long battery life	1

the features are really cool like the radio	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera get easy to use once you is used to it	1

shows used this monitor for years and now it i a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that love it i	1

the sound quality is good very	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model green backlight did and has the bright blue backlight which illuminates a screen more successfully than the nx is the nx	1

depressing is the scroll button not always responsive	0
it is so mac but big value small	0
this find i to be a great feature	1

this is not but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you removing the skin a great portable speaker system dock the ipod without first can	1
a nokia highly recommend i	1
update the finish is more mirror than i and silver like it	1
the were sounds as the movie directors intended	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
it has all features the one would need in a cellphone	1
is not only it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
i used this monitor de and now it shows a mixture of various colors and for years focused text	1
the setup process for the nomad with the player infuriating and the interface is is sub par	0
bottom line it did nt work re returning it it was supposed to so we the way we bought this router for our two computers	0
no fm or voice recording have been nice extras would these	0
the price good very is	1
cons think i the satellites look ugly	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1

it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
would recomment it highly is small and well designed i the device	1
even leaving it produces on the default setting crystal clear playback	1
are speakers these great	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
creative are the sound people static i can t understand why eax would introduce for computers	0
is color screen good	1
i got it today it works remote great sound for its size and price i understand not the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the able that being great to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
this little camera could created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i has love a digital camera so much	1
the remote works but then it and not work does you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1

proof auto focus performs well they i love having the optional scene modes but are dummy the and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	0
phone an excellent overall	1
sound quality is good	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main the on why i picked factors nomad	1
seems reads quietly read most dvds fine and to	1
now machines but i consider their quality pretty low nice	0
all sorts of problems has the player itself	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
was good easy to read screen	1

mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0

the grain was terrible	0
it looks great loaded with features is and	1
surprising sound is the full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1

monitor was easy to set up and works promised as with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
i many tried have times to a get hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely service customer rep is probably extremely overworked	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
what disappointment a	0
for apex machines money the have good features	1
the eax mode same keeps the volume at the that level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1

the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
for the first few weeks as was everything i expected it slim be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish to case this player advertised	1
very long battery lasting life	1
of the time shareport on this new router worked however	0
it the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before second begins its transfer	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time mp charge it uploads to s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
working for hours on with it shuffle totally rocks	1
its is even more pleased due to my wife widescreen	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
you see can the lens barrel in the view finder	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
quite as good as mm indoor shots with a flash are not on average	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in some other way or the same in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
quite bulky it uses a heavy battery although not very solid as and is contructed mostly of plastic	0
the software is quick easy to use found i the entire process very easily mastered	1
the adminstrative was great as long as you have an software user account	0

i hate apex but love tell everyone and i amazon	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price found both i	1
be prepared a long wait for lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the side controls display so even though i are reachable the have to open it up to see the display	0
the a flash attachment allowed me to buy and use hot shoe sophisticated flash unit	1
great speakers overall	1
the player hangs prompting on file transfer every once in a while up a reset	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able buy another easily to	1

living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs ring annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular and	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the function lever the one which between capture and view mode switches feels fragile	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you it pics with take on which is real good	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0

a got system error problem days after purchase	0
this model router has now me failed twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the menu menu items to pick from are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of options you to have scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
minor id tag even though the music is sorted via search on the player the option to complaints for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
i like the nomad is color better is not terribly flashy it but	0

i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0

the keyboard is although very nice and quite comfortable also it does take some getting used to	1

mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused on occasionally not turn to	0
anywhere can adjust the volume to be heard you or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
i think biggest is it is this flaw	0
fantastic looks esp w iphone docked	1
dead no pixels on mine	1
bottom line it did nt work returning it way it was supposed to so we re the we bought this router for our two computers	0
for that price of theese speakers the sound the comes out is unbelievable	1

all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to they when special people call	0
lots are there of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential there looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price buyer is no better camera out there period	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research best buy lrb office depot rrb	1
the pictures are even razor sharp in macro	1
i have tried rep to get the hold of constantly who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is apex busy as a one lonely customer service many times is probably extremely overworked	0
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
all in all suprisingly easy use to	1

i cautious giving this player m recommendation	0
on my main computer the software work right not did	0
casing had a heavier and more sturdy it	0
the rate plans are very also good at least for me	1
its for it you pay annoying a router and when does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the internal would still functioned but it network not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
it worked perfectly problems then the for about a week came	1
sound quality base and is amazing	1
are surprisingly quick through usb transfers	1
small size	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
does what it should and the fine seems sound to me	1
for starter nt cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo web say anything bad as you are just paying office this net book	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
numerous has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and the router other programs	0
player the hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
all the latest top stuff is acer notch	1
the replacement the bottom had a problem too the little switch on to was nt working properly making it impossible unit select among city forecasts in my area	0
reviews for positive are generally sound quality	1
this did nt bother me still because it is too much a decent size	1
fragile	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
the life battery drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
a great camera is this for you	1
overall unit like the i	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout with really long names it so so are only does nt show the complete filenames of mp s of the remote control you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
my overall with experience this monitor was very poor	0
the main problem with nomad the jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
is an excellent value this	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about nt the time but i do half mind buying notmad	0
the manual mode is fast access with easy to use for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but very not robust	0
instead key	0
these great are speakers	1
would definatley a friend to recommend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
yes camera picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any the in this price range	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
this is my first digital camera and what a is it toy	0
color and contrast are my for perfect needs	1
one bad thing is that it comes most purposes a compactflash mb pitiful card and for with it is not enough	0
fragile	0
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware did not solve the problem this but	0
it is a great phone if packed with wonderful features are traveling all over the world you	1
the resolution is very good and the colors bright and even changeable are	1
pictures wo nt transfer the included transfer cable directly from the camera using to pc	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
we in the or so months since second gripe purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
finally rating reiterate my thumbs down i for t mobile as a carrier	0
great camera can t beat it for the price you and	1
the keys not and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is are close together too weird	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
you utilized by the software be changing track information a lot because the cd database information ll is mediocre at best	0

it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
recieved in this product time for a gift giving works outstanding good the life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what battery rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
the price was the lowest i depot seen in my research lrb best buy office d rrb	1
for the price is it a well spent investment	1
died them after getting very shortly	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
the sound quality is excellent except on a tad too quiet at when times there are quieter talkers maybe the other end of the line	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
while i like the performance of the solely in every regard i would buy another one phone upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
the quick sync is nt any it becuase good either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
it excellent has also coverage through our two story house	1
also flawed is the lens cap design	0
is fine the dvd player	1
also can you store data on it which is much better plus for all you people who want to you an ipod just to say buy have an ipod do nt bother this is a a buy	1
quite bulky and as a heavy battery although not very solid uses it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
the software very easy to use is and was minutes of opening my box i within out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
despite i being slightly larger than the ipod i must say its was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
it was good color and price has great	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
i personally small recommend this router in every house hold or would buisiness environmnets	1
its ability to serve as a back up is for my music collection a huge plus	1
beats ipod is excellent battery life hours	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
the speakers and perform very well with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
i the headphone jack i charged it every day but did nt abuse it just sort of fizzled out	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
definitely more capable sound filling the room with of than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
very call which was immediately answered by made helpful competent tech	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models i since m a college student and this particular of had as poor monitor picture quality as any i ve seen	0
anything does does it this phone perfectly	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased especially the performance of the these compact speakers with at the low price on sell for here these amazon	1
found i after using it the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than to hours at most or fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
but this camera great is	1
first i ll start off by saying is this players hardware that pretty good	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
excellent phone the phone looks see than what u much better in the pictures	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
keypad backlit well	1

i electronic best ve bought since i was born	1
the router and my other wifi devices easily recognized further setup was a breeze	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
no fm or voice recording would these have been nice extras	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too is and there quickly no way to change this	0
simply today is the best digital camera out there the canon g at this price point	1
to cheaper it short this is keep and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	0
technology wise love think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i i this phone	1
i think gpu hardware acceleration that made the changes is that it now uses the real reason	1
looks ok chrome very shiny and mirrors	1
is this system very powerful	1
i and it for a week now have this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
great quality picture and features	1
is years with that carrier after expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
while i had the phone the earpiece features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and positive	1

great and pictures colors white balance	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and a signal receiving actually	1

it does firewire have nt not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you speakers expect might perhaps this size lrb from even better than expected rrb	1
although optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition the pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	0
but it what i do use for is perfect	1

bottom line i have a lrb set of speakers in the the labs i trigue speakers on my computer better at least to my ears rrb for less than half creative cost	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
www crazycellphone com when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from nice and small and excellent	1
the as were sounds the movie directors intended	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that something ok because all i need is is to work with my iphone	0

i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
the is book phone very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
but tried to contact apex via e mail have the e mail address is not valid	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
nokia and this baby mobile really teamed up well on t	1
i have to say rs user also pretty impressed by the m interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd i dvds	1

for the price and features it is really good	1
i would nt mind the an external adjustable antenna improved it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of having house is much but	1
for looks give it a rating of stars i	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the optics quality of the nikon legendary	1
the used to is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting keyboard	1
a little but weighty otherwise fine	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who serious about digital photography is	1
i star t rate it one can only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
is easy it	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for price its	1
beautiful highs speaker crisp home theater and music defined mids and respectable bass	1
the standard battery the g with include is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
about it i ve timely responses emailed creative tech support but and gotten already they will fix it for me if necessary	1
of months use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
i got it today volume works great measures sound for its size and price i understand that the able to control my iphone for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be get at the right great to placed the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being it i highly recommend this tower	1
awkward to use is flimsy feeling and the remote	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
my other big complaint the stand this monitor is about	0
it has a usb port you so can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
the macro the auto mode great for medical photographs and works is terrific for point and shoot	1
as always quick super shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
difficult navigation i wo nt but say difficult necessarily i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
it does nt have nt not a real complaint since most windows users do firewire generally have firewire cards themselves	0

very good range be seemed to and better in the horizontal position	1

i checked out the amazon reviews and i out pleased to say mine worked works fine right m of the box	1
all in all this is product excellent creative another	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
the is slightly lighter than it g and packed with even more features	1
the canon g is perhaps the best camera mp out there	1
the phone book is very user friendly is excellent the speakerphone and	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the are dirty is dvd	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen music to over the integrated radio	1
experimented i with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
randomly only complaint is like others here it is disconnects from the bluetooth and it my really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the second menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
gotten comfortable with it could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve navigation	0
the body runs through wire of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
the scroll bar is a said enough travesty	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to twice my vista pc at least reboot not fun	0
when the one dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing matrox g more of these super displays	1
good bass have a very rich sound and the speakers also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
but this is not nor in the zen manual neither the hard copy documented the cd version	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
i not and would bought this set it up connect at wireless n speeds	0
awesome in with huge print quality camera a tiny package	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that sounding have the same all name	0
again nt buy would because of the customer service	0
navigation could t but can is nt really anything the zen xtra there be better do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
a bit more it should feel as a portable player durable	1
however a phone call link the d to support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process a without problem	1
the to is a dream camera operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
nokia i and i m glad was my first nonflip phone decided to go with them	1

i to chapter get and everything freezes	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a intuitive size and weight a relatively decent navigational system on categorizes based that i d tags and excellent sound	1

is excellent quality picture	1
this router is awesom but it will contaced support support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i only they were very nice secure tried to to get it no right but thre best working avail bottom line if you is well worth the money have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very and this router just	0
overall is it the best camera on the market	1
when it works its fine but i have gone switches now both with defective through two monitors	0
lastly i is that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb some inherent benefit there feel unless in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1

i ve had this thing and just over a month the headphone jack has already come loose	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1

speaker wise i think this is awesome plus the technology makes it even great i love this phone	1
of course i ve hesitant given the price but i was been extremely impressed since receiving one and bought a second it as a christmas present for my parents	1
the top notch are reception and sound quality	1
i ve had this thing quite well never less than a headphone treated it for dropped it and the month jack is all screwed up	0
setup from in the box to minutes working and programmed for preset fm stations was under completely	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
highly i recommend it	1
point makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these digicams and shoot what at f	1
not like the nomad is color better but it is i terribly flashy	0
if you go not picky about image quality are for it	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to bad it is not as but as some reviewers have indicated	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
this is one of the nicest ve devices that i electronic ever owned	1
just the right size and great color display sharp picture for my desk	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
i telephone is many times to get a hold of apex who have nt seem to answer their emails and does number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep tried probably extremely overworked	0
on the up side the phone has amazing life battery	1
playlists can be made playing the fly without aid of a computer and you play modes use can like shuffle and repeat for your now on selections or playlists	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude if be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide bother to you do nt want to excellent photos with the settings	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
cheap rubber they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some construction on the corners	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router get going again then	0
good are not wowable they	0

you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0

mode with auto manual and the very helpful scene the possibilities which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the read is easy very to screen blue the and light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1

the more i work with it it i love the more	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can focused delete pics you do nt like that need not perfectly instantly or are lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
i m sure it would in can be useful where a different setting one and you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself it be all that to is advertised	1
any other digicam is closest to perfect than this camera that is megapixel	1
to be a great buy find the apex ad i	1
these ve tried playing all of i discs and they all play great	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
lrb when with the router internet service was restored lost internet connection the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
not counting i time the spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it you when were turning it off	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
for a specific still i location think its a great phone	1
but is easily scratched the screen if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
is good sound quality	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and back be sending this awful deceptive product will	0
is pretty solid the device itself	1
at first i really with this as mbps was still dealt fast	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
and experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers i they both delivered great results	1
this product too fragile for normal use is	0
find it too bright i	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
i is optics are better and canon believe their processing algorithms are also better	1

excellent picture quality pioneer par with my on panasonic and jvc players	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that has as releases not been an issue for me and is immaterial the you use if case the player cover the case covers the switch	1
the sound is so good wants my boyfriend that one now	1
screen lcd the was very large and readable	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
however failed to deliver on quality has it	0

even better do you nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
i enjoying my phone a lot am	1
pleased remain extremely i with this router	1
the g to needs different type of battery charging system also the smaller canon cameras the battery a has be charged while in the camera but the charging system from enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i find to be a great buy the apex ad	1
i m not tending impressed by electronics easily to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
the has which the radio function is utterly useless	0
so the things that in the car have listed despite far to could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work i the gym i etc	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
in that model the hard drive just died my class before one morning	0
mp target about right for the is market of this camera	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
is small the size	1
this the best phone is i have seen	1
it would just spin up and stop no display and disc	0
i product had no problem what so ever with this have	1
sound quality is my only significant complaint	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
with eax with different presets you can modify your sound on which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
work with it more i the the more i love it	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in on screen with the push that a button and be has an the scene manual focus mode of would it really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
first i ll start is pretty good by saying that this players hardware off	1
and works great too it	1

i am not to savy with a computer but very is the d link easy to install and set up	1
all it stands now the case is pretty useless unless load re packing the player up for travel or if you you up as your songs beforehand	0
bottom line good for the price these things sound great and have tons of is bass	1
of on the other end the person the call can hear you perfectly	1
beautiful home and and music speaker crisp highs defined mids theater respectable bass	1
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once you at the router online login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if is choose to use it	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from be speakers and had to the returned	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
finally mobile reiterate my thumbs down rating for t i as a carrier	0
no propietary headset jack	0
lrb lost internet connection the computer was restored when with the router internet service was connected directly to the modem rrb	0

others may have a flat panel luck but i have never seen better with such horrible viewing angles	0
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and the system such i suplemented as with a sweet jbl sub	1
it still your hand in the palm of fits and it is not heavy	1
would suck i headphones invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i can see this monitor between a drastic difference and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	0
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
overall i like the unit	1
but when we went to picture there was sound but no use it again	0
after using it for about a month i can a unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers state huge bang for the buck	1
i did not nomad to make creative managed explorer to work	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear overly extreme anything	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not as quite good as mm	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this quality at lrb price depression due to poor these random disconnects no doubt rrb and expected for me get a good quality product router kills it to	0
the system was nowhere near stable and in code was the alpha stage at best	1
when the screen was nt contracting was poor to fair glitching the overall picture quality or	0

acer they been awful to deal with has treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
and controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them the even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0

i m very pleased with my zx so here is quick a review	1
the person on the other end of call the can hear you perfectly	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
the router has obviously problems other static ip addresses firewalls and numerous with programs	0
pc too is cable expensive for a usb cable	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time mind i do nt but buying notmad	0
possibly the biggest in this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by and the lid opening popping advantage the new battery	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
it has the radio of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and lots	1
now that i own however it i can t imagine being without it	1
one downside though is that when does not work well autofocus battery is low	0
think the satellites look ugly i cons	0
but about it ve already emailed creative tech support i and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
it have a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and has network accessible storage	1
great camera	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem gd of buzzing from my acer random hz monitor	0
they look fantastic	1
it it easy enough to use for a beginner like me but is has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
is staggering the memory	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
focusing on a display rack of orange away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures a shade by this camera were blurry and in produced about feet	0
would strongly recommend this product i	1
the nikon coolpix in wonderful easy to use high quality and compact is size	1
hooked extreme n connected speed to the d link up dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
the creative features zen xtra has all the labs the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
i found the controls intuitive very and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
this apex model with my universal remote control not work will	0
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for car my is also easily worked your taking without eyes off the road	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
they the sound department be more comfortable but no complaints in could	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
bottom line i than to better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least a my ears rrb for less have half the cost	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
i know this unit warrant have problems in the future be the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will and worth it since creative will only will it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
price	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
when the talking voice is not very clear	0
this ways by far the nicest one in so many is	1
was was nowhere near stable and the code the system in alpha stage at best	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
the controls are have than the ipod but not somewhat harder to use gotten use to them and even at the beginning did i think would justify the huge difference in price	1
the data rate over the network storage much but i only so it for occasional backups use it does nt bother me too is rather slow	0
i zoom mode did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in also	0
folders can not be created audio the for files	0
for ask for more of this product i could not the cost	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
the headphone jack seems to be a problem major	0
it is the most bang for out the buck there	1
i and this set it up bought would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
it is small this less than the ipod but keep in mind that overall is because different bigger expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
had a jvc system that and years old was i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
my is wife even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and weighs it a little bit more	1
the progressive one option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is scan of the simplest and easiest remote or i have ever seen controls used	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
without any tweaking at all if and exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as is ve ever seen produced by film the this i a raw image	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player on a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based boasts id tags and excellent sound	1
this is by far the finest camera i its price and category in have ever used	1
after multilple tries one was finally recognized the disks of but video was poor and features not available	0
the storage is capacity great	1
it is slightly lighter than features and packed with even more the g	1
the excels thank a cell phone as god	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
mediasource did notebook install on my personal not	0
i wo nt go into the details the here the online sites their into great depth in go reviews but i am very pleased with the features as speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
i with it and i have been very happy got this thing for christmas ever since	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
this apex model will not work remote my universal with control	0

this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if time keep trying something it will work when it did not we one work before	0
the g had problems when in low light and would not take the picture focusing the shutter had pressed but after the shutter was been released a few seconds	0
not like the nomad is color better but it is i terribly flashy	0
both the black and the worth speakers are economically priced and white it	1
the purchased a for it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that thing would charge me jukebox repaing i damned they	0
well was photos are never great and there flash still a lot of noise	0
it does not only have properly it even has trouble difficulty playing jpegs playing dvd movies	1
everything surprisingly seems to work well	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little around children and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
songs your ripping and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
i simply this love feature	1
and i love extremely low loud bass sweet as such i suplemented the system with a and jbl sub	1
nikon out there feel is the best camera i for the features and price	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
i do the think that really matters though i to hooked my xbox up mean nt standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music be to potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
there are features of interesting lots included such as eax and customization	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files organize your songs to	0
they re and comfortable stay in place pretty deliver a decent audio quality	1
the manual is easy to understand it and is mostly idiot proof	1
is extemely lame this	0
even better with the optional headset you over listen to music can the integrated radio	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
it does focus in low light have an auto focus assist light not is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to which	1
i m glad canon decided to keep and mp resolution the improved upon it with new technology	1
is on the cheap side material	0
the battery than alot better is most of the phones out there	0
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors your primary link connect separate of can	1
i sent my monitor buzzing to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic in of random problem from my acer gd hz monitor	0
used the interface could be better designed	0
it is small overall bigger than not necessarily inferior ipod but keep in mind the this is because different less expensive but that technology is used in the zx	1
the battery is than better alot most of the phones out there	0
while to for a cellphone i was fully determined going buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files player the from to the computer was easy too	1
transfers quick surprisingly are through usb	1
its however x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
the aff feature the a great job converting did letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	0
while navigating also playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
only owned it about two weeks at i expect we re looking so getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage of speakers a cheep pair from	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1

and connection is not reliable the constantly dropped	0
it has very good range much the linksys router it replaced than better	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
lock the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will however up at odd times	0
wo play nt a lot of discs	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
picture quality from mm is indistinguishable in outdoor settings	1
i did nt the headphone jack it i charged it every day but abuse just sort of fizzled out	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
dvd the price it is a very nice for player	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the back to the store waiting to go router so i never got far enough to try this	0
capacity storage	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and this that suggests company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
i very easily this paired to two different android phones	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
my friends were the with impressed quality of the pictures i took	1
with tried to play the song three times i no success	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to faster much easier and windows explorer than using be	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
also can display is hinged and it the be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
nice zoom is x	1
it would either not play the was at all or skip wildly no matter resting the unit song that on my desk	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
pretty comfortable re they stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
i online ve trusted all the should comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
maybe it is i lack of experience but my found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
even the bass is from such rather small drivers pretty impressive	1

i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
this model router has now failed me the in twice short span of time mentioned	0
is very powerful this system	1
but the sound good very is and works well on my portable speakers	1
only one once about the speakerphone you can only the person you are calling the speakerphone feature complaint activate answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
tech support from apex literally is nonexistent	0

i have xp windows pro and when installing the enclosed did i software receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
portable	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i will never buy again creative product a	0
they are clears and perfect to be along with a sub used	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really insert in the ear cavity much out of the small headphones you expect	1
wire very clean through the body of the stand giving it a runs look	1
but with a lower price comes low quality	0
i probably and would love this player go with creative labs again	1
i have yet to try using all but the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc of all controls and well thought out and are the manual is relatively clear	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
site have tried several times to contact digital apex through their on line support i and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
manually just set it up i which is very easy	1
the software software is crap	0
monitor could tell this was a cheap i as soon as i set it up	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
huge storage space even you kbs at can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
so far the has worked well router	1
it is easy to use beginners for but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is camera excellent an to grow into	1
the instructions that come how do nt explain with it to make things simple	0
is made of plastic it	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which and simplest of the one is easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
do nt buy this player	0
it nt wo play all of my movies	0
i am really impressed this dvd player by	1
the second set is working just fine	1
after using it for about a month i a huge bang state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers can for the buck	1
to camera was affordable very easy this learn and produces spectacular images	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
of storage price gb	1
repeatedly software failed the	0
i blown out highlights been bothered by ve on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
very simple to use	1
the build quality feels solid it playing nt shake or whine while does discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
any protection is no speaker grill to offer there to the driver	0

support a folder stucture the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt first	0
i give it a rating for looks stars of	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
processing computer direct the and shipping was outrageously fast	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
were monitors the both good	1
is great the storage capacity	1
it is a fun little high do nt expect gadget definition sound	0
difficult i navigation wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
recently the user friendly functions this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent of m m pixel fine combos and many with bought are very similar to slr models and you added convenience of a digital camera that with can see pictures immediately	1
this router is phenomenal	1
creative are t for computers i can the sound people understand why eax would introduce static	0
this player to seems work fine with everything else	1
sound the quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1

it does well in of all aspects internet browsing	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly than consistently and those of other models i ve had	1
i guess that limited take warranty means it may lifetime a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
playlists or be made on the fly without aid of a computer for you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat and your now playing selections can playlists	1
device to the connection is so easy	1
when you put this phone in your so you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh pocket light	0
what face added in functionality detracts in build quality as the is plate is prone to popping off	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
creative zen feedback suffers quality construction from poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and lock out an awkward tiny little be button that needs to has depressed to turn on the camera	0
shipping to fast and they are very easy was set up	1
large is sub woofer	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
within with there are problems a year my menu dial knob	0

gb i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have huge storage space out of the provided to you	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb instead returned the item and got a linksys dsl i modem	0
well good had it power but no precision at all	1
i is small and well designed the device would recomment it highly	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
the player is are mechanics also flawed	0
it was worth has all this and more because ag neovo is standout monitor the wait	1
this time d link support was more helpful and link me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto fios the ethernet guided speed from my negotiate optical network block	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
and works great too it	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
i would not inclined be to purchase an apex product again	0

the camera is a also to operate in automode but dream gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1

screen bright visible	1
good range speed	1

is on the cheap side material	0
many of our disney movies do play on this dvd player nt	0
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under thrilled m i with my purchase	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box tech service the failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
seem s the remote control does p to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
this is the i phone best have seen	1
no option for ringtones i d pictures or individualized caller	0
can sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one so and for a fraction of the price	1
when the screen was contracting nt or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
it you can stand it on end and remote is far better designed than the s	1
is mediasource an application with serious user interface flaws	0
good the sound quality is although it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
treat the battery well i and it has lasted	1
when i only it up it audio produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the hooked no picture	0
its ability to is as a back up for my music collection serve a huge plus	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
unlike the other people of some who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
the player on up hangs file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
second the menu system controls and are poorly designed	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the you capacity need for your music collection	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
the keys are laid out is no guessing so there normal	1
overall i would reccomend these to at who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers someone a reasonable price	1
the buttons on the thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the only thing	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
very i am overall satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
my only gripe the hardware about is the buttons	0
price great	1
does the dvd player not work properly	0
buzzing sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random i from my acer gd hz monitor	0
mixed bag i guess was right the price but	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice a features beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
this thing is great i like my countertop use it to pick records tough stains on to and also to listen to my old track up	1
without a doubt i would say that be have the as the same sound quality jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can these speakers played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
is the woofer much larger	1
i but would definately recommend this phone	1
great picture	1
it comes lot with equipped of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1

i use is with a home theater system and it this amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
the remote works doing something wrong then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are but	0
it is than smaller i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
full spectrum sound from full to base great highs	1
was hell installation like other reviewers	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
the zennx will of running for the price keep a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this great because of the small size speakerphone option phone priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
very range good and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
your m sure and would it can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need i volume to be at a whisper	1
caller id for no option pictures or individualized ringtones	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous found page not browser screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
monitor about this my other big complaint is the stand	0
overall sweet a machine	1
the auto setting does a great job most there but of the time are manual settings for those who want them	1
only thing is a cd burner missing from creative	0
it sounds great out on the patio or night my on stand	1
stop playing in the middle my dvds would then or not even be read at all	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
if you re quality for a looking tower speaker this is it	1
while i had the phone the positive features good were sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
because can it help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
from a creative product is excellent as one would suspect the sound	1
would i like the performance of the phone in every regard i while buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
would definatley recommend to a friend a its volume can fill and small house for such a small speaker system	1
in other words the zen is not a capacity data storage device only buy the convenient you need for your music collection	0
the first night i got this phone i put next to me it when i my favorite music station to bed listen to just to went and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
i ve been using the to for about six weeks proven it has and itself g be all that it is advertised	1
mid range is is the best but it nt certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
and quality sound base is amazing	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible not sometimes	0
as a should player it portable feel a bit more durable	1
the headphones are nt the best but expect can really you much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0

great camera great investment	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
battery life charge very good i use it every day and i have to is it every or days or so	1
within a year with are problems there my menu dial knob	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1

the eax sound enhancement feature do nt did enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back after a good firmware upgrade and light up a smoke smile and perform well forever thereafter	1

fine is working just the second set	1
to keep it a this is cheaper and in my opinion short better choice than an ipod	0

besides hate i widescreen monitors	0
living in a small college apartment the but s and e s were beautiful e a bit overkill for what i needed	1
i think the real reason that made it changes is that the now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
my gut tells me the nomad worst in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at will a companies expensive lesson in very never to buy products from again	0
very good for value the money	1
the switch negotiated and just fine the speed presented the router with a gige link	1
