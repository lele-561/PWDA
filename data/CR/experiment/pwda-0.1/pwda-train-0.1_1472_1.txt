as a whole player dvd the has a sleek design and works fine	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if because of something that i did or if they do that i dont know if its because it was something tha they do that i dont know if it was something that i did or if it is a malfunction of the system of the route it was a malfunction of the system of the router	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed response times when going to the menu	0
the software failed repeatedly	0

have vocals greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
x the zoom is nice	1

the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0

the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
it comes lot with equipped of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the only two minor issues this camera i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
this is extemely lame	0
that include with the g is without camcorder battery the standard battery will allow me to take pictures all day a worrying about charging	0
i love the storage in this thing	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1

living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful too small but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
this was very prompt standard shipping and handling	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
this camera a has also great feel and weight to it	1

in any case navigation by artist miss is ok however i album an ability to navigate by folders	1

most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products no to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what are looking for is good in a small package	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little but it is not as bad some reviewers have indicated	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0

this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
to the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have also open display up to see the it	0

what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0

the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1

the sound from the player is ok	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1

i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and the app is a stopwatch	1
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i home tuesday	1

this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and but i did not know this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax in but i took care of it and that is wha engineered it that way to minimize the parallax in but i took care of phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on it a few times and there is a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
volume level is ok	1
timing of the the price performance looked just right	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
it is of plastic	0
as well as super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
nt been hassle for me at all	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
the results were both good	1
i thought the software was decent enough it nt complicated to learn at all	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
it also has excellent views of the city through our two story house	1
the mount is easy to put on the bike it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
another point of note the quality of his life is incredible	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
i have the same age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
fragile	0
they are not wowable good	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
it sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
life battery excellent hours beats ipod is	1
but if you ve used a slr very camera the controls are mm intuitive	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
love i love my new nomad its great	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
working hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
in that model the hard drive just fell out one morning before my class	0
these speakers are loud incredibly amazing	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature various backing up from my when computers	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
other than that thing	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would be processed more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
overall an excellent phone	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very happy with it	1
player this has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and this the photo quality is awesome	1
sound quality is good	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
even the slightest vision of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
the the software problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is main	0
it came back working and i was momentarily my that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be case in glad true	1
in all d say this is a decent router for the money	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
it to be very looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
the premium is good lrb do nt and user friendly	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be a lot easier because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized alphabetically	0
works super easy	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it b of mixing up	1
is this an excellent value	1
software is another great frequently hard to operate crashes misfortune screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
it looks great loaded with features is and	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
i just purchased this phone the best phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when am in the car i am listening to audio books	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
volume level is ok	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
unfortunately the player were not read any of my region one dvds even though they would not damaged in any way	0
the best phone is this i have seen	1
the things that are really cool like the radio	1
it is a fantastic piece of work and well worth the price	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
find it too bright i	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd my ipod nano	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer like winamp with the options	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
so far the router has worked well	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
is nice	1
very simple to use	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the pictures i and are is a learning curve to it there their tons of features are fabulous have nt even gotten to	1
the function lever is the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
but this camera is great	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
enough to make it easy the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
my two main requirements were better quality and lower price i found both	1
i ve been bothered by blown the fact that i cant make out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the fm radio is cool	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and most intuitive remote control controls i have ever seen or used	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige signal	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
great camera	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
in fact others say so	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
what day a junk	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
it does nt look too bad but when you are spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
the remote works but to sit then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
please consider this half piece of equipment before plopping down much superior a grand for an ipod	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
this is a great camera for you	1
the first night i got this phone i to it next put me bed i went to when just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does so weight anything its too light and feel nt comfy with it	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs dvd movies even has trouble properly playing it	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
easy enough but it did not work	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire and got some shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
first the zen lets you sync	1
very good value for the money	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
used usb transfer is insanely fast	0
after discovered the tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is busy and they do answer their web customer support	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
i am not to sure if this will work with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
the problem is that the fastest anything has connected to it has been around mb s in the same room	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
stopped output video workin	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
but after the sound but the video quit working	0
i have this connected to my pc and it works flawlessly	1
it easy beginners to use but has features that will love so it an excellent camera to grow into	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find it to be a great value for money i consider this to be another brand that i can trust	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been a problem	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
i get complete coverage everywhere corner lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the in my house of my basement	1
the design is sleek and the screen has good resolution	1
on the enclosed cd software for my application i found the setup software setup to be useless	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and a little hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
this model router has now failed me in the short span of time mentioned	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
is really good the sound quality	1
sub woofer subwoofer	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
portable	1
the instructions that come with it do to explain how nt make things simple	0
the explorer program down shut did a couple times nt i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did while have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
battery life is ok	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
within up a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
the difference in the colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
i ve now had the m for two months and i camera even more pleased with it	1
i love the i fact can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
the g volte technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
excellent phone the phone in much better than what u see looks the pictures	1
again the sounds were turned on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a backpack	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business environment	0
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and unbelievably can take the pictures with the lens you close the subject	1
the sound is awesome but if you put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take a picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released and the subject had moved	0
but ve emailed creative tech support it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
my blu ray player forever lean live tv box normally wd back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well and thereafter	1
key instead	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the quality of communication with the player is sub par	0
easy pair to	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
this small size is very compact and speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
for the is there price nothing better	1
the options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down by or have memorized where they are in the menu to select them by using the number keypad	0
it easily small unlike my canon slr so it is fits in my pocket	1
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend every penny it	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i have always owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
positive the on side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other for good achievement devices a hard drive based player	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the color is white red and is so attractive	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
however it does not play windows media and i not get it any of my divx rips	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
i with had this for months now and i am pleased ve my decision	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
also it was only with tax shipping and no free so overall it is a decent player	1
when i put it to use at is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
it did also seem to have a strong smell electronics new for some time	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
for the price is a well spent	1
i spend hours at a time in a vnc session trying to figure out how the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
not only is it more affordable choice but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
with it enabled anytime we made a connection we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
i m also running perfectly wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire in even through the groove in the of the base bottom	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is nice and to use	1
the quality is superb	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
lastly i that the speakers were over priced what got lrb unless there in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
the remote capture fileviewer and software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
they could be more comfortable but no one is going to complain in the sound department	1
made really what this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player on a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based boasts id tags and excellent sound	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would a little more complicated justify the huge difference in price in price	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
i did not managed creative nomad explorer make to to work	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great value for money and mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
great quality picture and features	1
one other plus is that napster supports this device via their software	0
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
i highly recommend a nokia	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
this thing is great to music i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
wheel the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
i love the quality of the pictures	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
dr johns awesome sound system	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
the software is my about to use and within minutes of opening very box i was out and easy listening to any one of my cds	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
some people problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
otherwise price for its a very decent monitor	0
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
i bought this phone for my trip to the south of africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you it pics with take on which is real good	1

now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
a i have had no problems with the phone	1
while i had the phone the positive features good were sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
hopeful i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
protective case completely useless as is as it obscures display window	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that ready for prime time this thing is not control	0
best i support tech have ever experienced	1
this is an excellent value	1
many of our most popular disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be replace it able to buy another easily	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
anything it does it does perfectly	1
it like burning plastic nt smell does when you open the drive	1
finding a good song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
than my previous netbook with single processor	1
the software is very buggy and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
tech support was very you and helpfull once pleasent actually got someone	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you to match the sound you are listening to which can be a big hassle	1
it is a great travel companion if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
known as its focusing system is also very flexible	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0

the problem with this box that reboots several times an hour if more frequently	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave them the best service i could	0
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
good looks	1
the fm radio is	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
technical support support rude and unhelpful	0
the sound quality is very good	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
acer widescreen ultra slim monitor up to thuumbs	1
you either way can t go wrong with this price	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
overall i like i think it	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0

for a small portable music player this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
what i do nt like is that lost at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
update the finish is like mirror than silver and i more it	1
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
it has many great features and very few bad bad ones	1
video output stopped workin	0
the keyboard although also very nice and quite comfortable is it does take some getting used to	1

focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines excellent grip are than any other camera i ve seen	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch over and over again the region dvd is	1

i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0

the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included eq adjustments number of the that for example compensate for a extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1

the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got money good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
it is a fun little high do nt expect gadget definition sound	0
it is great to be able to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1

ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick out of the cd and the quality is very good	1
these are the best deals are great for the price	1
the gone memory is staggering	0
this the light auto correction is awesome	1
it was easy enough to remove inserted and there was only one way the battery could be the front plate	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the user interface the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth a lot of detail being lost	0
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
the memory is staggering	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
i started downloading and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i can already tell that i am disapointed	0
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0

they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
the rate plans are very also good at least for me	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet has all the features the printer comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet trial version i have t trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock th then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock the printer comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock al all the features	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
they have a whole bunch of them in the us that all have the same sounding name	0
mine on no dead pixels	1
fragile	0
this little speaker has the best dynamite sound	1
it is worth it	1
the technology used could be better designed	0
the system stage and the code was in alpha was nowhere near stable at best	1

creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with headphone jack with the the headphone jack	0
fully going for a cellphone i was while determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned to us	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch work well and	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling the best places in the park	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
the digital zoom on a dslr takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
without a doubt i don t care at all if the exposure is low or high the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
the link does not work properly	0

their network coverage is very poor and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
or maybe netgear the firmware so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
so now it still t everything you just can plays see it	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
after some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1

the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
it was really easy up out of the box i got all my wireless devices lrb desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
user replaceable name battery	1
before asking for the zen xtra mp player i researched a few different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
its ability to serve as a back up is for my music collection a huge plus	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
for the money apex machines have lost	0
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for price	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
third continues the poor design with the case	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is than with standard speakers making it harder to hear	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
it is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the sound level have also not as high as i would is expected	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
also for some reason the washed looks picture out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
works great	1
for lowest was is still less than even the a price level ipod i that able to then and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and get this gb monster some	1
you can create playlists for your mp player you can drag and drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to my player	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
other than that this thing is great	1
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
to use	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp they as s stream directly from the xtra	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put so much effort and quality into the g	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think this is a good idea and offers some advantages	1
when i turned the phone on the first that hit me is how good the screen is	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing and the camera captures the minutest of details	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
the image quality is excellent	1
this nicest one of the is phones nokia has made	1
people also have is about and not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case complained sturdy the case offers very good protection	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access use	1
but i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
i dont know who no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had of the songs	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on as they stage and are truly portable are the best jbls i have ever used they have the same sound quality as the jbl on as they stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i lov lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop when i switched to photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
delivery was prompt	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
great camera great investment	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
the speakers soundstage with good treble have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for but it is which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
very good value	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
it is too expensive for a usb cable	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
i the controls like aperture priority have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature and aperture priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
nice to have them back but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
then sorting the files is	1
sub woofer is large	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week use and i can take pictures of anything i was asked to take a picture easy of a vacationing elderly group	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
and it works great too	1
considering the price and specs this the best deal might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device you	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
you some course have of good customization options with the unit as well	1
user replaceable battery	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online it i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get sometimes times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as lrb goes nailed it gets for hours without rebooting rrb	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at and a dvd getting another progressive scan dvd and a new player of higher quality very soon	0
i tried e mailing apex didnt respond and they come back saying undeliverable	0
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox install	1
wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
easy enough to navigate through although i prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
this did nt bother me still because it is too much a decent size	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
size is smaller than the ipod	0
my dad also has also an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
uploading the images to is windows based pc my very fast and simple	1
i bought my canon g a few weeks ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
i ll be very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front of the house	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
bottom line i have a lrb set of speakers in the the labs i trigue speakers on my computer better at least to my ears rrb for less than half creative cost	1
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
only one thing to note about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerbo feature once the person you are calling has hung up the phone not while it is ringing	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
overall sounds great and less expensive than apple	1
this machine will of your whole idea change what a laptop should be	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or if you have to carry it in your pocket	0
do nt know what other people saying but the software is awesome	1
i think the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
video above the problems came from my video card	0
i have excellent hearing but the speaker on this phone is especially quiet	0
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it take a bit of time to get used to experience and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound the room very fills outs exceedingly well	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very have happy	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
also very and portable	1
very convenient to etc in menu scroll	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
the woofer is much larger	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
surprisingly everything seems it to work well	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the g has the battery is charging so yo a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while system on the g in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down th be charged while system on the g in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
really like i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
i have used a few months and have had no problems	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
great camera and for the price go wrong with you can t beat it	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
great of life quality picture and features	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
it is also work with my iphone but that is ok because all i need is something to a bit bigger than expected	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
price price	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has been amazing	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
my only significant complaint sound quality is	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up with the mouse down or tilt feature rrb	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to wants who anyone quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	0
i have tried several their telephone line to contact apex digital but their on line support site and times through they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
b fast mediasource it takes cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
the main problems with the sub for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
screen brightness the food is really good	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
i have tried rep to get the hold of constantly who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is apex busy as a one lonely customer service many times is probably extremely overworked	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
well it was nice while it lasted	1
do for what i but use it is perfect	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
the man who looks like a work of art	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be this company so calm so positive and over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	1
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
was error prone even that process to my amazement	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
it is small	1
at first i really with this as mbps was still dealt fast	1
found i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
i am quite proud of myself for having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
besides i hate it	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
for the price of theese speakers the sound quality is unbelievable	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations this price	0
there are in functions so many this little yet powerful camera	1
i got this for christmas and it is awesome	1
matter what i do it will always be in the picture no matter whati d it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing the performance is nt the greatest the search funtion is nn fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut https www google com store apps details id https a it with the hotkey shortcut	0
i was willing to live the with larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
overall it is the best camera on i think the market	1
i m this player giving cautious recommendation	1
i have had no problem at all what so ever with this product	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
even viewed jpgs full of cds	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model green backlight did and has the bright blue backlight which illuminates a screen more successfully than the nx is the nx	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time of time for something to work	0
the pc sync is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router the router i replaced and when combined speed of with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
this is one of the nicest ve devices that i electronic ever owned	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d tag data from the cdds service the ripping process doesnt allow me to populate the year and date	0
can with the optional headset you even better listen to music over the integrated radio	0
your products though kudos apple are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
scroll down to switch	0
the device itself is pretty solid	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
my on par with excellent picture quality pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
other things that i miss are voice dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
also i have not had trouble reading any of the mp and vbr mp cds	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user very easy to set up friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give photographers them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
unfortunately i tried it and the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
d link does not have mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
a wonderful set camera has the of features	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no	0
they pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear hear a thing	1
the sound is excellent as one would one suspect from a creative product	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
this in so many ways by far the nicest one is	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
tech free support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs even though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d i	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
this is an ideal purchase	1
works great	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i have ever purchased and was very important i made the purchase	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
i just sort of nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack did fizzled out	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
the nikon coolpix in wonderful easy to use high quality and compact is size	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
i m not one easily uses web browsing so this phone who met and surpassed my needs	0
the canon g is one of perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles are which is a nice feature when you as a radio bored	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the storage capacity is great	1
that the earbuds come with it are nt that bad	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
they caused the problem ie wrong n the box the tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong by puttin product in the box the service by putting the tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
going re you to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player i found in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
took me a few tries to get to play use good game and a very to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
hooked up to network the connection speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
the reception and sound quality are	1
i agree with the earlier agree reviewer angle and you need to adjust the brightness who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are the screen does not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size the only issues i have are minor the feel and layout of the remote control ar only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s not feel like a real remote control the screen does not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through ever with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
for the price i think it is a very nice dvd player	1
also the lens cap on this lens is flawed	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely tech savvy so i know what i m talking about when it comes to a lot of people	1
last note i this monitor with than what can get in the states	0
got a system error problem about a week after purchase	0
connection to the device staying healthy is so easy	1
it really with me impressed the disign the specs the price	1
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras lots of add on options comes with great software and last but by far easy to use has easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far easy to use has a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received m not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
do nt buy this player	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
understand i can t also why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
i just set it up manually which is on my computer very easy	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
i try navigating to a chapter past would and it via the menu nt do it	0
i sent an email in to acer for help and was told there was no solution for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
it full hd has a nice color screen	1
it may	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
my wife even more pleased is due to its widescreen	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
the screen is very easy to read and the the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too lon stare too long the blue light on the screen is very easy to read and the blue light in th blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you screen is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too lon stare too long	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
well backlit keypad	1
there is also to so it sits very low no height adjustability the desk	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
easy to pair	1
d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
the manual mode is easy the menu system to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
the sound is from the player ok	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
it does well in all aspects of internet marketing	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
i tried to play have tried the song three times with no success	0
creative are the sound people for computers great i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
however the creative software is not real yet	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
however i the clip nt like to carry it on my belt because do is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
having unfilled i d files will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
if you wear it as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
only if we could get one camera in it	0
sound the quality is very good	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
first the cons a tad bulky not player is the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
no the camera firewire to direct	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
solar power goes full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good as long as you make sure that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
for all the features	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries it s a little slow and it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it it s not a bad deal just make sure it s charge that came with weren t charged properly if you have any problems it	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
maybe it find the quality of my is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
this product is too fragile normal for use	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
this product is amazing	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
it plays basically every media i ve ever bought so far even an old vcd that i ve never seen before and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen gb and it	0
this is by far the best camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from of the modem the cable modem	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than can use it the s	0
well within days the video output quit working	0
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
you choose now playing interface other different things with it such as can what kind of do you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
very easy to set up	1
and it much sooooo holds music and audio files	1
also very light and portable	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
it is slightly lighter than the previous model and packed with even more features	1
i was customer surprised that pleasantly service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
is highly recommended otherwise phone this	1
i a few years did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
i ve it to work i can t even get a signal get attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
excellent heavy build quality fairly well the stands are not imposing and blend and into the rest of my furniture	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
i also like the fact that you can save custom game saves that you made on the player not just the computer	1
the has the utterly useless function which is radio	0
simply the canon g is the best digital out there at this price point	1
this phone is a winner	1
both and very easy to learn use are intuitive enough for even a novice	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
the usb port a nice feature the back is on	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
the price is right	1
what a junk	0
i m not easily by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
great speakers overall	1
no way to complain about their customer service	1
windows through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to the disk this is a great feature for the nomad	1
hdtv for competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its great	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
this is amazing	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
proven canon errors	0
the at mode that keeps the volume eax the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
now when the backlight fails works fine i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
it is light to carry around all day without bother	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
performs well but love having the optional scene modes they are and correspond to many situations in which i would actually to use the camera	1
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
died very shortly after i lost them getting them	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
selected i bought it because it looked easy to install	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
i ve used the speakerphone for over an hour once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid a lot of money for	0
it has all the features one would expect	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
but if great you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
it is easy enough like to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
quite bulky and as a heavy battery although not very solid uses it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
it also costs to do a lot less than the ipod	1
camera is good and the the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
well backlit keypad	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
i simply cannot	0
however for a budget i think this is a great option and is an excellent choice	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
it is not	1
the player itself has all sorts problems	0
when you turn on your player the player will turn on automatically and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
received apex dvd and the picture was the great when set up with s connector	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning is easy to use and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy would recommend it to anyone if metal no problem	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
less than a freezes later the screen month and eventually shows no disc	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be it often	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0

i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
that is a very important and valuable feature	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
seems like a good product	1
regular fact cd this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered will that it by accident play mpeg files on a the that r data disk without vcd formatting	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield a daily basis especially if you good results on idiot program auto mode	1
the dvd player is disabled fine	0
if i were to rate these books based on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m not going to do that because i think they do the job that most people want them for	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to is very good your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
i treat the battery well and has lasted	1
you have to press hard and i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
i love this player and am extremely very happy with my decision	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous error page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
well the theory was great but upon things stopped working	0
only that i dont know con i can think of is no camera	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w still it and sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned is but it all the way down all right because these are computer speakers	0

the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
the sound quality is good and the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major upgrade over the ipod	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
some features in the user interface	0
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones the insert in you ear cavity	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands apps free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i work study travel hoped for had	1
storage capacity	1
the headphone jack seems to be gone	0
one bad thing is that it comes with it and for most purposes a pitiful mb compactflash card is not enough	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
and it works great too	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m going to be very happy with my purchase	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i highly recommend it	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
the functionality on this camera this is mind blowing	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then going again get	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars	1

the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
this is a great camera for you	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
this phone has many other features ir just to view as the most beneficial one the features above i name	1
x zoom is nice	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
i was so happy i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	1
headphones suck i would invest in a new pair some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was no sound i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
i apex called is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am with these very the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price pleased sell for here on amazon	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
the keypad is a decent but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
the g looks like a work of art	1
reviews for sound quality the are generally positive	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can for less than you go wrong	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
all i can say is that this the bottom line is that this is an excellent game enjoy is an excellent devise	1
bottom line great for the price these things sound is and have tons of good bass	1
even the bass is pretty impressive that from such rather small drivers	1
due to the lack of just for whs upnp guestnetwork and having support dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
when the one dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing matrox g more of these super displays	1
the pictures are pretty good even in macro	1
the which software comes with player is not good at all	0
this apex model will work not work with my universal remote control	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
the gb zen xtra does not wash my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
just received this camera two and love the features has	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to slow it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer would not connect to the internet in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
crystal clear is sound and the bass is very deep as well	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
the first one devastated to say the least installed did nt work and our kids were we	0
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
the tried to connect to it next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
it has a nice color screen	1
i gave to only stars due it the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
the lcd very large and readable was screen	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
the environmental audio however and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
paid than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected get a good quality product these random disconnects kills for me	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone have i ve ever had	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is i think the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the screen is large defined and naturally cool and the silver unit is easy to read	1
color the screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
i really like the quality of the pictures	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
this place is trash	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
the quick sync is not really any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
i have done this many times and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
this app is the best i have used to date	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
seems to read most dvds fine and im able reads quietly	1
the toggle button is that used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i low frequencies and suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i say i was surprised to see how small it was unwrapped the box	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
price	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very look	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna would be nice to have one but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
i just hooked it up and everything be going fine	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is that the mbyte cf that comes with it for processing raw images i only have a mbyte and the first thing i did was replace the m byte cf with a	0
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
highly	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
i m delighted with this product	1
sound settings can adjusted be adjusted for personal preference	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
they are not the same	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
apex ad runs all r dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd the rw	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
is compared to ipod is replacement battery	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and and very tight precise speaker wire hook ups	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
playlists can be made on the fly without the need for the use of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your own selections or playlists	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being very difficult to play and plagued afflicted by a number of glitches	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
apex the is best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
because can it help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
gotten comfortable with it could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve navigation	0
great features	1
after years with that carrier plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
speakerphone	1
tv is very light and slim and fits nicely into my the machine stand	1
the is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
this is are excellent player especially for the price with features that an comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are better	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who half the things a mountain fraction for a dvd player that t can do paid this one can and for a of money of the price	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
i camera not played with all the features yet but the have is easy to use once you get used to it	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust what have though notmad may still work better	1
were nt so clear images taken indoor	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when uploaded them i view them on my monitor	0
have to tried contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
the macro works great for medical photographs and the macro mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
i paired this two to very easily different android phones	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
fine worked	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
i was with smart ripper to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which files me to stack movies it a dvd but on also was able to play vob allowed which i created surprised	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
door broke after a month	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the in program id tag editing is as a strong point well	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd we when and got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement the ipod touchpad over	1
slow to download and run on some devicesi wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
sharp image	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
plug play not relies on i d no fm or recording	0
this was awesome an player before the video output no longer worked	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
this is my first digital camera i love how and what a toy it is	1
it has percent minor glitches like for example when i turn it on its of the time the player sais shutting down which means i have to turn likings and turn it on again which is not to my off	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played put than of the dvds i less in it	0
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the second set is working just fine	1
screen brightness is really good	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
no propietary and no jack	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
about of the time it can t find when the device i attach it to my pc	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
but canon never ceases to amaze	1
ever camera best from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
i try navigating using the player is built in and it still nt work	0
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
lrb yeah like you ll a new very expensive dsl as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
at the end of the day price i wanted a was large capacity player which is me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra allows combination of what capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
however the main reason i am will satisfied is this product with the fact that it not lock up at odd times	1
great phone	1
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
it gives great pictures the casing are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge controls software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome the	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
failed repeatedly the software	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1

i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the battery life is amazing	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
screen good easy to read	1
all am all i and extremely pleased with this camera	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
the screen is very bright and bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or sticks	0
the volume range is great so you can really get into it if you want	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
no dead pixels on mine	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
am i enjoying my phone a lot	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
it has very good range much a lot of features better than the linksys router it replaced	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent too	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
typically it is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
the door would not close	0
since it would not work as advertised i decided to delete it	0
very long lasting battery life	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going use two or with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
i thought i needed to reset the router	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
i was a little disappointed in low end	0
in fact to caused my system it hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good music have a great review of sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
i am extremely glad i bought this camera	1
my other gripe is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
small size	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward clickthe camera has a little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
the earbuds included were uncomfortable	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
loved the slim design	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
if you do nt have tags it lump ll all of your tracks into the not directory and they can same be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
in other words the zen is not a capacity data storage device only buy the convenient you need for your music collection	0
portable	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
on my main computer the software did not work at all	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed all the way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
i like the nomad is color better way it but it is not terribly flashy	1
it has a good signal strength very light weight and is	1
the monitor works very well and comes with a sharp and bright display	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
so router the far has worked well	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
is it it get woth every penny	1
file great picture	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill	1
problem the player sometimes freezes not a very big also but can also be annoying	0
all easy to learn software it in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is its great sound and easy simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
picture quality is excellent	1
the monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector	0
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a phone line out of it	0
the car keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig you do easy	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
other tagging that can result from the nomad is operating system	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
i would have rated it five stars for the poor manual	0
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
it also has a stock tracking app a and built in somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
there are lots of interesting features eax and customization such as included	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
is this system is very powerful	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it doesnt have a lot of features like bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great results	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal missing of information	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
it is the most bang for the buck the best bang out there	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
stop playing in the middle my dvds would then or not even be read at all	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do not have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
the software sucks	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
good battery life	1
no option for i t i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich were also of similar characteristics	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive movies on it when i dvd player that had more than the standard set of features was looking and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a and always got a busy signal	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this an average of per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
i know this unit i think will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days be worth the money and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will been worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
it favorite being the games and the music and the radi has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep the habit of listening to them them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is ruining my media	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker good choice for an set	1
first of all the player is sound quality superior is to the ipod	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
wyja nienie fantastic esp w iphone docked	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
first of all my calls loud and clear were unlike with sprint	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is not very good	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
i think it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0

i am very pleased with it so far	1
the catch with the precious camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss canon g shots	0
the sound is surprising full with a good amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
it is easy to use you just have to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
this led monitor is fantastic	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
takes excellent more photos	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
takes excellent photos	1
is small the size	1
super easy	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the player has firmware which will allow you to fix the glitches if there are any	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
this is my second creative labs mp and player it is definitely a fine product	1
have the player since xmass and love it	1
i find it pretty use to easy and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1

the price is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1

the subwoofer gets terrific sound and has really high	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0

the best thing about this monitor is the stand	0

it all this and more worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has was	1
at ounces is pretty light but as the ipod	1

range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad with decided to go i them	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have of a computer	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
overall an excellent game phone	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
overall a sweet machine	1
no way is there the battery supplied lasts hours	0
i had no problems setting up the software now my favorite cd is on my hard drive and getting my favorite cd is transferred	0
setup was very easy	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
products on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is feedback	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i have had mine for a month couple of weeks now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at router is login there is setup wizard which will work with your os if you to use it	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with it	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
for is who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good a computer speaker rrb for this those probably necessary	0
ripping your songs and putting them on playlists could nt be any easier	1

its easy to go online and check itll	1
the sound and is fantastic quality it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
i got this for my birthday and for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
plusses are the battery the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
brightness contrast ratio i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
i am very happy with its quality and durability	1
i bought this camera and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have not even gotten to all of them yet	1

camera great	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
for a specific location think still i its a great phone	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
i can recommend this to phone anyone anytime	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
good range speed	1
the only thing thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break feels like the plastic very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
nt buy again because of the customer service	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and deep bass	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
even if its better on g band than the linksys	1
this camera is great	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
you can manage your profile change the color of the background change the type contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
it also has unproven battery life	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the best bang the buck	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and say m pleased to i mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the nt but i do time mind buying notmad	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
canon is that he does it consistently	0
p s the remote it does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but control may be just operator error	0
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets and better better better	1
easy how to hook up	1
the more i work with it the more i like it	1
i m sure it would can be useful in a setting one where you would only need your be at a whisper	1
it was already there and we just plugged it in	0
this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g who is serious about digital photography	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
use i this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
best in class sound	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of put some rubber on the corners	0
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem tags for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not anything now	0
best in class sound	1
the interface software itself which be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
the first routers good worked for years	1
this means that is a good chance this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the reason to rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment t its very small and hard i turn so you can dial get an accurate adjustment	0
the replacement top of the screen unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt front of the working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0

they are very sturdy and have no or balance wise trouble handling oddly shaped speakers	1
overall i like the unit	1
the service from t mobile sound quality is very good too	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1

the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
the only problem problem that i have found with the internet service mls is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
after months it some of the stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0

i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of the main page	1
these speakers are great	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive that i can t use at worst a hard drive i can use but one on which i can s create folders or at worst	0
one complaint the screen scratched too easily is	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i ve tried playing all they and of these discs all play great	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
you can be up to about feet away feet from it and it will still work perfectly	1
range of functions as indicated it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those are serious about photography	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the photos that i take	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
fm receiver it has none	0
i ve all that it is advertised using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be been	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find log more just out on to canon is website	1
very compact and this model portable just as described with great sound quality	1
the only thing that has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as season season and season	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to nt and have match had any problems	1
this phone is also one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
great phone i d buy another	1
update jan the device has worked stem flawlessly for the past year	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1

it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
upon opening these i found them to be very well made small but having a solid feel to them	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
you can tough to automatically focus the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual move mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is focus	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0

the dvd player is fine	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
this is your to have for wonderful first dvd player	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the web browser to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
to the simple ipod ones are much inferior the controls	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
it is easy to use and easy for my grandmother to use	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
i found the apex ad to be a great buy	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already created you will have to do it manually and transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
here is kind the phone is tiny cute feels the brief synopsis of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
i getting am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never very impressed seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
this router is awesom but it will contaced support support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i only they were very nice secure tried to to get it no right but thre best working avail bottom line if you is well worth the money have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very and this router just	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
it is lighter to carry around and easy to use it has enough functionality to use	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
the software was designed to work as long as you have an adminstrative user account	0
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
software is easy to use	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
great picture	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the sound settings but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to set up my sound settings in is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound quality	0
the storage lack of capacity is great for me	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
when i st itself i with that that had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play i to it was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner tried it my surprise but had made the disc found	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
i personally environmnets recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness would	0
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is bit a very nice addition although is pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
it has good color and price was great	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are in a hurry and want to keep it in the palm of your hand	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
however the phone problem to a d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a call	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn built in and produces spectacular images	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
not only is it the perfect size it also has a great screen and has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
cons i think ugly look the satellites	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the are your requirements house then this router will do the job	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but cd player with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
have had no problems and have used it frequently	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
compared everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the battery life seems good no lag takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
while the ease of use i put off by the price about more than i paid amazon for this player	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better the ipods than	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the scene mode works well for is set up in a way that the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
the case to too small it took me like a half hour just is get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
the remote a little hard to understand is	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
it came well packaged	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
you can assign when they call	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
scroll button switch	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds my comparable to those of my home wireless router when using were home broadband cable modem as input	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
with gb of storage have songs on the player with	1
without having to go through the netgear taking all the extra steps tool through the isp and genie would be far better	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt easy as i would have liked	0
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
this app is a replacement for your desktop	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t some of your real dvds	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since the saves me from lugging it cd case to work to a the in gym car etc	1
still i willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
simply this product was created and left was left behind	0
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for a refund just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing it	0
speakerphone	1
the customer support is very	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in dream of owning a mp camera	1
i simply love this feature	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i m delighted with this product	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
after multilple tries one of the disks finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i end was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to watch a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the dvd player to do it is job	0
in addition it comes with a sleek design and powerful headset	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
screen was good easy to read	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
i spent hours on that and i could not get it to connect to the internet	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies r and r and now im using dvd re and r and it plays the dvd using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
not seem to one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
the price was the lowest i d seen i d ever seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
i give give it a rating of stars for looks	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
honestly i am	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down on the idea for t mobile as a carrier	0
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
the price is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
the woofer is much larger	1
and with a simple app transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker sold was i	1
with eax with different presets you can modify your sound on which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was about minutes up in set	1
unfortunately it can t play that way	0
i think that the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
i chose the g because canon eos d mark ii of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
having access to so much music where terrific you go is ever	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you in low light just that much closer	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
this has taught me that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
the excels as a cell phone is a god	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
pros so off i went to needed get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
nt i wo difficult navigation necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
