the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb is the only thing that makes sense	0

i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
i found that a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
it s great and for the price you can t beat it	1

we believe greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the keys to success he said	1

the results were both good	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i send an email and they come back saying undeliverable	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had the same problem in the first place	0

the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing music and the sound quality is excellent and the picture and sound is top notch	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0

the ihome is stereo reproduction system	0

it looks very cool and seems quite a bit of fun to me and very light	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work again and again when it did not work one time before	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
the sound is excellent as one would expect to hear from a creative product	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are intuitive	1

i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
no games it has ever been used for why not use it	0
mr trump is trash	0

the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine has been running without any problems right out of the box	1

slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helps	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a portable cd player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of both of those things and easily meets those criteria	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than the tv remote	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
highly recommend this monitor as it is hard to beat at this price point	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
its cheap and it comes with a remote control	1
i just have to set it up manually which is very easy	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the product	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with the g for processing the raw images i only have the g in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1

for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
picture quality is excellent	1
and the sound quality is very good there is no complaints about that	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the problems with the video from my video card	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1

best electronic i ve bought since i ve been alive	1
my first impression was positive	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this camera was affordable very easy to use and produces spectacular images	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
wire runs through the body of the device giving it a very clean look	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose the type of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
awesome sound system	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
if you want a quality product delivered to your door buy this one	1
the earbuds that come with the iphone are nt that bad	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
going through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the technical support phone number that was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
i really love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this list to be quite disturbing	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
great quality of life and features	1
the top that was supposed to hold the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the second set is working just fine	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
i have had no problems with the service	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is a bit bulky and it would be better if it came with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it was a bit slow between shots	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best point and shoot camera available under	1
megapixels is enough for me and the photo quality is awesome	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0

one downside though is that it is not waterproof and does not work well when battery is low	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
it may	1
screen was good easy to read	1
i highly recommend it	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
you have to press the buttons hard and fast to scroll so i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the user interface is great	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the right side of the screen kept going	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1

the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
screen was unavailable	0
it is worth it	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and drag and drop songs directly from cd to your players	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i have been using this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
for the cost of this service i could not ask for more	1
do not buy this player	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1

portable	1
speed means fast data transfers	1

one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
overall i like the unit	1
i am still in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1

i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
the zooming lever is a nice touch but i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0

sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1

the changing colors help to tell the time with a quick glance	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to download them	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1

there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc easily enough	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1

my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
it is not it	0
excellent range of products as well	1

at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1

the controls are on the left side instead of the right side which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1

they sound wonderful in the studio and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
the sound is excellent the quality of the music is excellent the battery is excellentthe battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the other ipod is excellent	1

the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
as a portable player it should feel good	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
for a small portable music player this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
it was worth the wait because this is standout monitor has all this and more	1
it has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
equipment included is average but that is not a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with no id	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
my only complaint is that the cord is too short	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a new high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
it will read and play the entire all cd audio disc	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is great	1
i really liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
overall i like the system features and performance	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i have not yet had any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
the storage capacity is great	1
to my mind even that process was error prone	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do not have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress was halted when the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the user interface now there is interface	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
i love this player	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big deal for me as a visual artist and i found out by accident that it will play mpeg files as well it can be played on a regular cd r	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
however shareport on this new router worked fine	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
what is added in functionality vs what is lost in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the screen is always on and ring tones are unlimited	1
anyways back to the point i was trying to make i have tried to be so patient over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0
my blu ray player and my live action dvd box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
no need to search for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
usb network storage is good but it is slow	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
if you are not picky about what you eat go for it	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an iphone	1
without a doubt the finest looking and most powerful dvd player that i ve seen	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen button to adjust the focus it also has a manual focus mode that would be really useful if shooting a scene that	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the phone has	1
i do nt always have time for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
great phone	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
sound exceptional but i can t really compare it to the ipod	0
i bought this monitor from computer direct from the manufacturer and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever seen	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
i did buy the notmad app about a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i have always owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
this is a very light phone a little less than a year old with long battery life	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
they caused the problem ie wrong software was installed in the box the service tech failed to fix the problem because what the software said was wrong	0
it has never worked	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
i m giving you a cautious recommendation	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were nice to have but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the app is easy to use	1
the digital zoom on a dslr takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
the touchpad is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the system is very similar to the ipod in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	0
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
thanks for the excellent photos	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
additional features	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but i think this one really deserves five stars	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
so if you re game for a good weather day you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
for the rest of us there is nothing better	1
i have not even used my new dvd player yet and already i am disapointed	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
well it had good power but no power at all	1
i love the fact i can just put it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them because the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
worked out	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my other speakers	1
only if we can get one camera in it	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and expensive but the fact that they exist tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got disconnected	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nis is and the backlight is also brighter	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the screen is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a robot should be	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i ve used the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful when i tried to use it in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
this is a great product was easy to unbox and install	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
the pictures are pretty good even in macro	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained within	1
very simple to use	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets a little bit better	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its simplicity	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
x zoom zoom	1
my only complaint is that if my phone is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
i do not have a problem with this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
otherwise this player is awesome	1
i could tell this was a cheap phone as soon as i set it up	0
is nice	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
seems to read most of the time fine and reads quietly	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
range of functions as stated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information on the screen when you zoomed down into the screenwhen you are in zoom mode	0
great quality picture and features	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
however for a budget i think this camera is pretty good	1
the machine is very easy to use and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the build quality is top notch	1
i was looking for a little bit of everything and this product delivers both	1
feedback on creative is product support is very poor this is not limited to the creative is products it applies to all the company is products	0
but if you ve used a slr mm in the past the controls are very intuitive	1
this thread has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
the sound is awesome but if u play it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
this is an excellent value	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
i am bored with it	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
also navigating while playing music is a lot more intuitive unlike my previous player	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the price i was willing to pay for this router i was very unimpressed	0
it is easy to use you just have to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
when i finally made it home i discovered that the menu options for sending a message via either text or email simply were nt there	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
no propietary headset	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra is not the music it is the software	0
neither message was answered	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
for the price it is a well worth investment	1
however i never did fail and i have not dropped it once	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an easy to use interface i also liked the fm phone and earpiece	1
it works great	1
very tight joints with a matte black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
it may	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
sound settings can be changed	1
good range speed	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
navigation system the zen music player uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
easy to hook up	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only turn on the microphone and the speakerboom feature once the person you are talking to answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
i purchased two of these players for christmas last year and both were bad	0
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
in fact i would say not bright enough	0
the size of	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
i do not think it is the quality of the picture that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
seriously i love it	1
harmon international has done a great job on the sound of the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not play in order they play one after another like on a cd	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
good luck life	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
value comparing price with price	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i would like to see an ability to navigate by folders	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
there was occasionally a	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of performance	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy modes and correspond to the types of situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	0
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
the memory is staggering	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seems to be the best i have seen in that category	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it take pictures but it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my expectations	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer works	0
the headphones are nt the best but you can get a lot of sound and not get much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with all the necessary software to make sharing printers and other peripherals a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
however i do nt like to use it in the shower because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should be able to help you enough if i am not mistaken the bass is great	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for money	1
this is not for you	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are not that good when i called the company they were very nice and tried thre	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would not be able to survive a drop	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a great point and shoot camera in the mid to high end price range	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
the router failed today lrb is not able to connect to rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i ve been a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business environment	0
i am very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
other things that i miss are a headphone jack and a standard mm headset jack	0
i selected the highest quality camera and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely happy with the purchase	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my computer but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
it is also very light unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
at ounces it is pretty light compared to the ipad but not as light as the ipod	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i sent my monitor in for repair and i am still waiting for a solution for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
it will only move the cursor from side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
the results are amazing	1
it would have been a lot nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
i was so happy i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	1
i am really impressed by this young player	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
headphones suck i would like to invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
my only complaint to the router is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt have it back up and running again i dont know if it was something that i did or if it is a malfunction	0
other than that this thing is great	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use and is very light and compact in size	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone who is looking for a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
i was willing to live with the small size but the durability was a big zero	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
user replaceable battery	1
this is by far the best camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
it wo nt in all of my movies	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
overall a very good buy for the price	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
the g looks like	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good for the price and the quality is very good i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
awesome sound system	1
the game program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just a few times	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
this camera has a	1
what a day	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally light	1
awesome camera with huge print and a ton of features in a tiny package	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily accessible	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
overall an excellent phone	1
it was terrible	0
the technology used could be better designed	0
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster drivers which is very annoying	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
it is easy to use and it is feature complete	1
better battery life	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost and high quality it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness of the screen are so low i cant see across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no need for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the game is very easy to use the software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1

the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
mediasource is a web browser with serious user interface flaws	0
i love this monitor	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is better	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i had no problems setting up the software and now my favorite cd is on my hard drive	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1

this router is phenomenal	1

it looked just right	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
another point of note is that he is incredible	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to get a lot of shots and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
the cover that came with the book did nt fit very well	0
the screen has an extremely bright screen and its design allows for the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
all in all this is a great product that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is easy to understand and use and a great sound	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could not be happier and i m convinced it is the best mp player out	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you get home	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zoom is a must it gets you just that much closer	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least a dozen times which was not fun	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
also the feature to automatically update the lyrics in the song information is nt always accurate	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio i wanted	0
well backlit keypad	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the price	1

not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0

i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
portable	1
the ad did nt seem to be working corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a minute and a half before it started to act up	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
i have listened to these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial up	0
very good value for money	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
the battery is nice	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0

excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer players and jvc players	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new linkys dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i would have bought the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
some people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
no matter the format	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was not as easy as i would have liked	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat screen tv with such horrible viewing angles	0
however once you crank the volume up a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the sound quality is great lrb well this is the best i have heard for	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service rep was able to step me thru manual setup	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
by cocking the camera back to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce a very good result contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
the touch screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
this system is very powerful	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the screen are only so so it does nt look like you can see the complete filenames of all the characters and s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before	0
i can do this very easily to two different android phones	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps only	1

no it has none	0
the food is really good	1
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
the book is well written and does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because it is less expensive but not necessarily inferior to ipod the same technology is used in the zx	1
i find all of the controls well placed and i am not disappointed in the least	1
also i can t understand why the software does not list the cds in alphabetical order the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
i fully expect it to turn out to be bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
easy enough to navigate through although i would prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was originally meant to do to be a great mobile phone	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is not the best but it is fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
i have been ripping songs into it for a while now and the ease of use is wonderful	1
one also exhibited extremely slow response times when going to the menu	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
i have this connected to my imac and my macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
it is great to switch to lcd for the metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the link dir n wireless router works fine as a n wireless r router the link dir r wireless r	1
those who are used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1

very compact and portable just as described with great build quality	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a bit bigger and a bit louder	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price is easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
the sound from the player is not audible	0
one good thing it is gb of water	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt worry about it i got this after first day	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon is a great product that delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some great shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
the quality is excellent	1
i ve sent e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
this player is an in game purchase	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
playlists can be played on the radio without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around for a long time and it s even when in the same room	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
great speakers overall	1
some people have had issues with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
what a day	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
for the first few weeks this dvd player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi media player it is a great dvd players with a stylish slim case as advertised	1

no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
the volume	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
many of our disney movies are missing or do nt play on this dvd player	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the price is very good	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database is very small and the memory utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
these are perfect for my needs	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to set up and easy to access and use	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic sound effects	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and for docs is more than acceptable	1
bought the gb version of this book a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
speakerphone	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
nice little phone light compact	1
the lack of capacity is great for me	0
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against the elements	1
i highly recommend this camera	1
black and white balance	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1

the has the radio function which is used for	0
very easy to set up	1

bass fanatics will be at the s pii	1
i really love this netbook	1

quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
set up wpa ssl	0
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
i am using the i n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
so far the router has worked	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
they are surprisingly quick through usb	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on every site	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
it is a great camera for beginners to use but has features that more experienced photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the fact that it does suck	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being able to live without it	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
the screen quality is very high the side of the screen is very sharp clear	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did	0
it works only during installation of the system	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
again the numbers were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
it does well in all aspects of web browsing	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced and expensive	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
i got this for christmas and it is awesome	1
it is not	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve had to deal with nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i m only had the player for a few days i leave room for doubt if the mouse and keyboard jack	1
and the fact that the construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the screen is very bright and easy to read and the screen is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
the software is quick easy to use i found it to be very easily mastered	1
the woofer is a	0
about of the time it can t be seen on the device when i attach it to my pc	0
no way to complain about their customer service	1
i have been using this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
i am ripping this into kbps wma files this gives an average file size of about mb which is good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
the screen is very bright and easily read	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
it has a nice color screen	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use and has very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i wake up and everything freezes	0
you of course have to be familiar with the unit as well	1
i followed the installation instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you have one	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these speakers are available for here in the market	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
great camera great investment	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
i have to say i m pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
great value gb for gbgreat value for the price	1
canon is that he does it consistently	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt work on some computers	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable to wear and easy to use	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american tv shows the dvd is	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in a long time lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery life easy to use software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
you will need to install nomad explorer first and then use it to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it this is not the case	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
the volume range is adjustable so you can blast it if you want	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a slim waist and a slim face plate	1
pictures and videos will nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
i ve had it for about a year now and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
it is a nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
if you re looking for a small compact super compact digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
it is smaller than i expected when i bought it but as it turns out so much the better	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
vocals have greater clarity with the guitar as well	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to be able to answer their emails and telephone number is listed as the one lonely customer service number i think the rep is probably extremely overworked	0
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
i dont recommend a nokia	1
it is not	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
surfing the web on it is a lot of fun as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
the problem is large	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
video output stopped workin	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours since i picked it up for my son for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this d dvd player	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in my car and it is very audible even with freeway noise	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i have had	1
depressing the scroll button to continue	0
overall a sweet machine	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright screen	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit and receive data across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it came on and i just stopped and will not do anything now	0
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of the game but there are some things that are not going to be in a regular setting	0
despite this minor disappointment i would still recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before i got there	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my router far too many times in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
value comparing data storage with price	1
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in noise cancellation in the crossovers	0
easy enough but it did not work	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i expected	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
so slow that it is not recommended for files of any size or back ups	0
both units are equipped with similarly small speakers	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
the music sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
this is the best phone i have ever used	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my cd player came in perfect working condition	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
well flash photos are not always great and there was still a lot of noise	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
great features	1
scroll button switch	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
ripping your songs and selling them online could nt be any easier	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
the design is sleek and the screen has good resolution	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i have not had any issues with this phone and am more pleased with this screen than any i ve used before	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a while for you to collect on the warranty	0
the sound this slim design makes	1
the software on this one is pretty good	1
overall rating	1
a hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
it sucks	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
it is small	1
this is a little hard to understand	0
made call which was immediately answered by the police	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective and easy to use and is linked to a good cddb service	1
this feature is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be very helpful enjoy	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled with the system is mind blowing	1
i treat the battery well and it has a long life	1
its easy to use and you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
sharp image	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and the sound is good enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0

however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0

this machine is broken	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1

i could have tried navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0

i s the remote control does seem to get stuck at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
best in class sound	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
nice and all	1
best group of support i have ever experienced	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
the sound quality is really good	1

for the money apex machines have good features	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
the progressive scan option can be turned on and off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1

the player has the option to play the game which will remove the glitches if there are any	1

great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd sound quality and price make it a good buy	1

the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is too small and difficult to operate	1
you ca nt see anything wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music is very loud and the sound quality are very poor	0

great value great investment	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1

it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily in your hands	1
for a price that is still less than what i was able to find on the market and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal loss	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
without a doubt i have to say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
but for what i do use it i love it	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
i think this speaker really rocks	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that has a ring tone that is close to a regular ring	0
i usually avoid horns but i do not want to hear anything overly extreme	0
price	1
the time had finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
you can also assign special rings and numbers to your phone to special people when they call	0
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you want to listen to some good music rather than heavy metal no problem	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
solid resistant to scratches and scratches excellent heat dissipation	1
the sound quality is very good	1
i have yet to try out all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the menu system is relatively clear	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
looks fantastic too	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that were in the box with it	0
well within days the video output was working	1
my first reaction was positive	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the store	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to judge it based on the fact that its in a different class	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
i should not have trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
the fm radio is cool	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i finally gave up and stuck with mediasource	0
the appearance is okayed	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0

pc cable is too short for a usb cable	0
the functionality on this phone is mind blowing	1
the quality of the screen is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i just bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
this product is definitely worth it	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play the dvd format which allows me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart cards	1
but this is not documented in the zen version of the book neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
video output format	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it plays them	1
fm receiver it has none	0
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
it is made of	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i think i can live with this cd player since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the door would not close	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
by phone	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new features	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is much lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
the software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
i dont like the automatic key lock function	0
sometimes the system would freeze up and shut down so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
overall an excellent phone	1
this was very different from the standard shipping service	1
that is true	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
small print	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the only problem that i have found with this app so far is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flash cards just as it does with the dedicated flashes on the g	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and hard to use	0
i m sure it would and can be done in a different setting than the one you have where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about a month now and i am very happy with it	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
i did nt think i would be able to get this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot d to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
the netbook i bought came as a breeze for my sales person it works fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my old netbook so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
way less expensive than the alternatives	1
great price for this product	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1

i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
a replaceable battery	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
very easy to set up	1

and i am a big fan of jbl and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
exasperated at am i right i am calling it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or if you have to carry it in your pocket	0
so easy to set up had no problems with my archos	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
its a bit difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly music creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does not have a lot of features sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the quality of the camera the speed the picture quality the quality and the automation and the functional conveniences	1
buy a high quality scan player for a relatively low price	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies and i put them on dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i keep trying and it keeps telling me no disc	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up most of the screen and the user has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it should be	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i am not going to buy another one solely upon the apparent performance of it	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1

nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
the first one i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0

this led monitor is fantastic	1
for the price and size and the quality of the product you can t beat the price	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address given to us is not valid	0
the zennx will keep running for the rest of your life without the need of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1

without having to go through the netgear to get the tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
the sound quality is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you are looking at something on the screen instead of	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be a lot of fun because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by genre there are also some tracks which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	1
the switch negotiated the speed of the router and presented the router with a gige link	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
what convinced me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd and that i would get my fill of files	1
to keep it short this is a very good phone and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
nice and compact	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0

the apex has been a very good performer for me	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does have a few quirks	1

i hate widescreen monitors	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with the results	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0

one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0

the customer support is very rude	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would be able to use them due to the huge difference in price	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
when talking the voice is	1
now heres the good and the bad starting with the good the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as well as in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
the g has a different type of charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system on the g enables you to use the camera while plugged in to the charger	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would be processed more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell to it	0
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
fragile	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
the features are really cool like the radio	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are a lot better than any other camera i ve seen	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
a great deal at an incredible price	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d folder on the right side of the screen the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is too small and does not work well	0
i chose to use the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
this is one of the most popular phones nokia has made	1
they are not wowable good	0
so far i really like this mp player and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who want a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
no dead pixels on mine	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the fact that there is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not work	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others episodes	0
item shipped out quickly was easy to set up came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me a hard time about	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
because other people that complain about the speed of the ball are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
great minds	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the price	1
this is absolutely terrible	0
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
have had the player of my dreams and love it	1
this guy is phenomenal	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i can hear it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
this camera is great and has a great feel and weight to it	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the end	1
great minds	1
all in all it is very easy to use	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the buttons on the phone are a bit big even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	1
technology wise i think this is the best phone ive ever used plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
the macro mode is very good because the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no extra cost on my part	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
the next day i tried to connect to it on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping charges the monitor was at my door on monday night and in the mail by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
i love this player and would love to go with creative labs again	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
the replacable battery is great since once it runs out or wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
this video is very powerful	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
apex is the best cheap quality dvd player for dvd players	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
and really this is the best phone one can buy	1
the colors and textures are great	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
the second video was released about two weeks before the video went out	0
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
i did not get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it would shut down and i could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc the only thing i could find	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses but it also addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
you can see the top of the barrel in the view finder	1
seems like a good product	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the customer service is very rude	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
i started accessing and editing the files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
all in all this is a great deal for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
overall i do it	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass so if you want that you will need a huge subwoofer	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
featured image	1
volume is ok volume is ok	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
i bought this set it up and it works fine but i could not connect at wireless n speeds	0
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
when the screen was nt turned off the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding it is very easy to use it has great battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
so far the router has worked well	1
the bass and treble levels perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
it has very good range much better than the old router it replaced	1
this is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat more advanced analytics application which converts all types of metrics	0
what a disappointment	0
i simply cannot	0
the reason i don t recommend this model is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to see so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
we tried enough but it did not work	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i was able to go with them	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of it	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to see how easy it was to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
instead	0
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
great picture	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is very useful as you can get different variations with it	1
battery life is ok	1
i found the apex ad to be a great buy	1
well i hope this does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
sub woofer is large	1
apparently t mobile is heavily data logged and can t keep up with demands	0
i would not be inclined to agree	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
it came pre packaged	0
the headphone jack seems to be gone	0
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
it has lots of little features my favorite being the games and the music and the radio	0
good battery life	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
i think this is it is biggest problem	0
loved the slim design	1
this app is the best i have used to date	1
these speakers are great	1
it does not have an auto focus assist feature which is nice for taking photos in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in light but it is not as good as the sony	0
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
loyalty is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
a little too weighty but otherwise fine	0
i ll be very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front of the house	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
the colors and everything are great	1
i cant believe the storage in this thing	0
i think apex is one of the best you can get for the price	1
i m delighted with this one	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does not come in the overused blue	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
minimal pause between playing and pausing much less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
it had a heavier and more durable casing	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most of the users do nt generally use firewire cards themselves	0
it would play the disc and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
this product is not available	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem with the driver	0
you can stop looking this is the only n router you will find on the internet this is nov lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
some features in the user interface	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt need to worry about that the ability to delete pics that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make the whole process very simple and effective	0
the system has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and restart it which is not ideal	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i love you	1
mediasource did not work on my personal notebook	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
it will be equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
it is very stable and has a good signal strength	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and i cant get the picture to come back in after skipping a few moments	0
it is very easy to use and yet very feature rich	1

they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
i remain extremely pleased with	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
got a system error a few days after purchase	0
i tried to contact the apex cust service no help	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
all in all bad device bad customer service and i will run like hell from this product	0
after using it i have found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
it makes up for this by being very intuitive and easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
it plays just about any video that i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
the light auto correction system	0
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset radio stations was under minutes	1
bottom line it did not work the way it was supposed to so we ended up returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main deciding factors on why i picked the nomad	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g for a while now but i seem to do only slightly better	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the dark with nice colors	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time i have mentioned	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best ive ever seen	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the hard drive with room for about more	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the color is red and is very bright	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
this is extemely lame	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
just an average user but there is good value in this product	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly but was anything but easy to use	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be working fine	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough to use	1
and it holds sooooo much more	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
i love this app it was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
the operation with the windows home professional memory option was not possible on the netbook with windows home starter instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	0
i find this to be a great story	1
bottom line i have a better set up in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for now	1
first of all the player is sound quality and the sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
it does not only have trouble playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
when i saw a lot of places where there was metal i was concerned that the music would not be as good	1
speakerphone	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i would recommend	1
this site has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb and nt on the dell rrb and edit them	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it was a good deal	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
neither message received	0
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
but canon never ceases to amaze	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
works really easy	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the software i am using is very easy to install and set up	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
the camera is a very versatile camera that is easy to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
view this screen	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
a week out of the box and i began to feel slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
and with usb transferring files from your computer to your player is incredibly easy	1
positive reviews are generally positive	1
this thing is trash	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mps	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
too many tracks to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
because this camera sucks	0
amazons new customer support website is useless	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
the software sucks	0
the rate plans are also pretty good at least for me	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load all of my music onto this unit	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
i am using them in my office and they generally seem to be very good	1
i will be able to use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
the sound quality is	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
first the cons are that it is bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it has great battery life fm radio with excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
after multilple tries one of them was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
ipod x battery life hours beats ipod is	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
this product is good enough to integrate my car into the cx to my toyota camry mode	1
it is made of plastic	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling trip	1
we got two new phones for the t mobile family plan and one of them died yesterday with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you want	0
i have owned this game for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the connection is not reliable and has been dropped	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
the tools that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
i find it too bright	0
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the zoom function allows you to zoom up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with the view of the	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and the disc shows no disc	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
mixed feelings i guess but the price was right	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
storage space	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the scroll bar is a travesty enough	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image of the letter looked normal	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
the sounds were as the movie directors wanted them	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the last few days of memory	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
the zen stores data files but does not store them in a folder structure nor does it have a file system that allows documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a large amount of media files in the cloud i have a music folder	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on the road	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can be very loud in a small house for such a small speaker system	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
this is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
for the money apex machines have lost	0
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
now when the backlight goes out i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
the camera has a number of features	1
the problem is mechanics are also flawed	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
also for those who don t know the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs even though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d i	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
nice machines but i would say their quality pretty low now	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
the player is intuitive and easy to use with great sound quality	1
worked fine	1
very convenient to scroll in menu bar	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the back of the car is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0

it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
difficult navigation i wo nt mean to say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
second the menu system is confusing and controls are poorly designed	0
also the player sometimes freezes in the middle of the game but can also be annoying	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i agree with the other reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle and you need to adjust the brightness in order to get consistent contrast	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was free	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
i will nt buy again because of the customer service	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
your health is fine	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at the time	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
color screen is good	1
please a firmware upgrade that will allow all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer as well as the web portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
overall i like it	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommend it to anyone in the canon for picture quality	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results in the long run	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the picturers are amazing	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent game	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the software is very easy to use and within a couple of hours of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
delivery was prompt	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
one complaint is that it is too easily scratched	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped it	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in the room and deliver a decent audio quality	1
my favorite camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
deficiencies with zennx are easy to overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the only two minor issues i have with the lens and the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
since it did not work as advertised i called support	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got for them unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know about	1
this is a toy and what a toy it is	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still recommend it	1
but i would definately recommend it	1
i have tried so many ways to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their website is always busy	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the usb port on the back of the phone is a nice feature	1
of course i was sceptical at first given the price but i ve been extremely impressed with it since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
it takes about an hour to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is still not really robust despite what others have said though not as bad as some others and may still work better	0
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive piece of luggage which you can take anywhere	1
the noise cancelling earbuds were uncomfortable	0
set up wpa with no problems	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping of the tags fails to populate the year field	0
no more pixels on mine	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see on the screen is what you get	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of stuff on this thing	1
i needed three batteries to charge the g and i found myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
her voice is superb	1
the store would not close	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
cocaine is too fragile for normal use	0
seriously i am	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good marks for quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
the pictures come out so much better if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using it	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
silverish color really adds a nice touch	1
but this camera is better	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
i did nt abuse it i used it a lot but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
the grain was terrible	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
great price	1
it also does nt have an activated dialing big minus	0
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually have the ability to pick up a signal	1
as it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on i feel tags and excellent sound	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to them	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
we are very pleased with the monitor and the company	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
this phone is very good and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal went out	0
the software mediasource software	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
this player is going to work fine with everything else	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
the compact size of the camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
this is by far the nicest one in a lot of ways	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are great	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks off and makes me want my beer but does nt wash my car	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
my only complaint about the hardware is the buttons	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
it took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
also you can get a lot of data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy it just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a great way to buy	1
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
well the theory was good but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased to say that in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of technology	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize the disc and takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
even if its better on g band than the linksys	1
the fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
i loved it until it was gone but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
screen brightness is really good	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
great price for all the features	1
there is no way the amount of water supplied lasts hours	0
the problem for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
i ve also had the nomad zen guy show up several times	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
the fm radio station	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac we have to use the phone with the base or it turns	0
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
so why do this	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
while going for a new phone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
very long lasting battery life	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule and i have no doubt that they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
storage capacity	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic in the hand but seems pretty sturdy	1
the remote control works for a while but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
its great to be able to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
but if you re looking for my opinion on it go ahead i love it	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
for the price and features it is really good	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the settings and i was shocked to find that the game is actually ruining my media	0
the sound quality is very good	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
i ve had this for a while now and i am pleased with my decision	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually contacted them	1
also i have not had trouble reading any of the mp and vbr mp cds	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that the company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated if you dont do it quickly	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number of videos on dvds	0
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
the sound is great and the volume is very low perfect for commutes and shutting out external noise	0
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be automatically placed in a folder called unknown	0
the first routers worked good for years	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t be done with some of your real dvds	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
i was a little surprised to see it in the low end	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
finding a good song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
last night i realized i needed to reset the router	0
the price is right	1
after years with that carrier is expensive to use and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
or maybe they have so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for the speakers and the remote are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the best sound possible so i do not	1
the hard drive i had attached to my computer was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
it is invisible and dissapears in your pocket	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
the problems came from my video card	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for the price	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than they actually are	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
i have nt had time to really push it to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are a bit of a mess as should be expected from creative labs	0
i love the quality of the pictures	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
text s p ratings s p is basicly junk	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
i have no complaints with you	1
lens built quality and lens	1
the scroll wheel is a bit of a pain	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total change in him and this is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do is job	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
great but i d buy another	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
i wanted the product to work for me but it just did nt	0
unfortunately after a few months of downloading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
i think this player is awesome	1
folders can not be used	0
technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
tech support from apex is almost nonexistent	0
the quality is very good	1
they are very sturdy and have no problems with being off balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
uploading the files from my pc to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
months of use and it no longer does anything	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures and does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
the set up is goof proof and the result is a superior result	1
full spectrum sound is back to great highs	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
the key is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
there was neither picture nor sound	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the buttons are reachable i have to open it up to get to them	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
over for the most part this is a good unit	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen k monitor	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
software the software is crap	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i like the flash but as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
i think the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an amazing amount of options and power	1
i t	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you are packing it up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
works great	1
the device is small and well designed i would recommend it	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
connect the player to your computer open up the player and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
i would highly recommend this product	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for the price which is what i have	1
this page	1
i love that it is so easy to use and it looks likeit andit it it it it it it it it it it it it it it	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs and lows excellent clarity and respectable bass	1
well this dvd player turned out pretty good	1
price	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
i do nt want to be rude but this computer is incredible	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
it also means	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am able to get from this g and can easily see how people can put up with the cameras limitations because i have never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the photos that i take	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
and then i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
it has all the features one would need in a smartphone	1
this is one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate it perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the stand	1
i ve used it for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no information	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard and mouse broke	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is not working	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
i have had this phone for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
i got my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
my favorite thing about the nomad life	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
i love this book it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
some features in the user interface	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
takes excellent photos	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at the moment	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
upon first looking at these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
it is easy to use and easy for my grandmother to use	1
one other thing to note is that napster now supports this device via their software	0
i have over files in my head at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
i did not know how to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
it came well packaged	1
price gb of storage	1
they are clears and perfect to be used in a boat along with a sub	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
ripping the usb cable out even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
b it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
it is a lot lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems to be down resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
while i would have given it to someone else instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	0
there are	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with you about the quality of this speaker	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
i got this thing for my birthday last year and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has a little bit of style a bit down of course	0
do nt buy this player	0
sounds like a good product	1
p fantastic little computer does a lot more than i had hoped for work study travel	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the bottom	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of with a lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is a good one	1
third the poor design of the courtrooms associated with the case	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
navigation could be a little tricky at first but there is nt really anything the new xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
it is crystal clear	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
this is great	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
this phone is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
it did have a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but i was too busy waiting to go back to school so i never got far enough to try this	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack is still missing	0
i was hoping that acer was nt more helpful	0
it is a great camera with great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it own casing	1
small size	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
