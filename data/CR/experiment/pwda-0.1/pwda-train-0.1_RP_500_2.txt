when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
other than that this thing is awesome	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a good size	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
great value great investment	1
they fired away and it all turned out quite nicely	1
the labeling of the product itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
the quality is excellent	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
it is a great travel companion if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
because it can help a so so photographer take better photos	0
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very easy and the quality is very good	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two most important factors on why i picked the nomad	1
setup was very simple	1
i treat it very well and it has lasted	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your vision	0
flash as with all things in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
if you are not picky about image quality then go for it	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it it has a very nice casing	1
unfortunately i had to buy a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
as it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational interface that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound it is a great value for money	1
this router is the best router i have used to date	1
the screen is bright easy to read and works well in the daylight with nice colors	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be nice but i dont think the price of the unit will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
much faster than my previous acer one that i had with single processor	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
the fm radio station	1
this is a great deal for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
the zen sound is great and sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the rest of the process so i dont think it was a problem	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and not work properly but it may be just operator error	0
the apex has been a very good performer for me	1
for the price it costs	0
the screen is very easy to read and the screen is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you are reading for too long	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would be easy to get your fill of files	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
this phone is a joke	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
i try navigating back to the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
i was looking for a little bit of everything and this product delivers both	1
volume level is	1
the food is really good	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
i do nt know if that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
i tried to play the game on my phone three times with no success	0
when i finally made it home i discovered that the menu options for sending a message via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the standard battery include with this camera is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
they are very sturdy and have no problems with being off balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be ignored	0
it looked just right	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the entire screen the only difference between the lcd and the nc than the nis is green backlight did	0
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
but anyway what i think you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
poor visibility and	0
it had a metal casing	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with this company and their terrible service and support	0
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it was based on which only lasted months	1

what is added in functionality vs what is lost in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the second set was	1
reviews for sound quality and performance	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
also it was only with free shipping and it was a good price so overall it is a decent player	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use and is very light and compact in size	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
i chose to use the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to work with you	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music player on the computer	1
these are the best places for the weekend cycling in the park	1
also the lens cap on this lens is flawed	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent place to start but not on this player	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for it	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you told them you got someone	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
the image quality is excellent	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
speakerphone	1
i purchased both of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
i am enjoying it a lot	1
simple to use buttons front buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
it wo nt play of a series of books which are all store boughten	0
other than that the picture is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
better battery life	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are now using them and i am very pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual on the hard copy nor the cd version	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker with great bass and highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the screen and the only thing left is interface	0
i found it very easy to use the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not	1
easy to hook up	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things like the soundstage is really big and the blue light on the top is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering it is a great sound	1
it will just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
without a doubt i would have to say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly the best i have ever heard lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
because it can help a so so photographer get the most spectacular photos	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has been amazing	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt rotate the lens but the lens maker knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the barrel distortion phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
i have tried several times to contact apex security through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and my telephone line is always busy	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the user interface is great	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
battery life is very good i use it every day for a few hours and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
it would have been a lot nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only for your music collection the zen has the capacity you need for your audio collection	0
i started accessing and editing the files to find it to be extremely slow	0
i love this player and am extremely happy with him	1
long lasting battery life	1
the speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
uploading the images to my windows based pc is a pain	0
the hands free app is quite powerful	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
my first impression was positive	1
the setup process for the nomad is slow and the interface with the player is sub par	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are great	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter but it does if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
the software mediasource software	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs but the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd w rw	1
i used this one for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	1
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i can give this phone to anyone anytime	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone but it is a very good phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
the sound	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
in addition it can be controlled with a remote control	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the world is small	1
although i agree with most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
mixed feelings i guess but the price was right	1
i wake up and everything freezes	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
even the slightest of touches to your face totally distorts your image	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
works super easy	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the service at the airport is very good too	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
i love this monitor	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
the apex has been a steady performer this year	1
overall it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent deal i would recommend it	1
i do nt for the life of me see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with the excellent customer	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is too small and difficult to operate	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
but this is not documented in the book neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
the sounds were as the movie directors wanted them	1
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
great price	1
the device is small and well designed i think	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
so far i really like this mp player and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who want a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
it seems that with each update the router gets better better	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping charges the monitor was at my door on monday night and in the mail by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should be able to help you enough if i am not mistaken the bass is great	1
mp x optical zoom is amazing and takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to set up and use a lot of features and add on options to make it even better with great software and last but by	1
it is small	1
i have tried so many ways to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their website is always busy	0
the sound quality is	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do not anticipate any problems with it	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
very tight fit and excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online reviewers will go into more detail in their reviews but i am very pleased with the quality of the camera and the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences	1
having access to so much great music where ever you go is terrific	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually push the button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world with your family	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
what a day	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
we are well on our way with the monitor and the company	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
i really like this netbook	1

my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1

i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and now i have gb out of the provided to you	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would affect the way i play and it did	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to download them and then download the additional games	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
finally i can give my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mps	0
the colors and textures are great	1
they had a great time and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
as well as super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
a little too weighty but otherwise fine	0

i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for money on a variety of different sites	1
the sound quality is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you are looking at something on the screen instead of	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very good	1
in fact others say so	1
speakerphone	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your favorite mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting is that the zen xtra is not included in this list	0
works super well	1
the audiophile in me was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on the deck	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses and is unable to run ssh and numerous other programs	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because it is less expensive but not necessarily inferior to ipod the same technology is used in the zx	1
other then that it is a fantastic piece of kit for the price	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same name but they all have a different name	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling for this product at lrb price depression due to poor quality of the product and no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
only thing that i can think of is no camera	0
the backlight on the phone goes on and off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
the scene mode works in the same way for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	0
they do look cool as hell though	0
your comments are great	1
range was comparable to or possibly better than the old linksys router i had been using for years	1

the link does not work properly	0
i got this for christmas and it was awesome	1
this phone is good with a huge screen and a lot of features built into it	1
if i were to rate these books based on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m not going to do that because i think they do the job that most people want them for	0
the only thing missing is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
this has happened to us with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work the first time before	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was free	1
no way to complain about their customer service	1
instead	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is not as bright in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good marks for quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
does not provide enough volume when compared to larger headphones or external receivers	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said that you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets a little bit better	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
if you re looking for a good deal this is it	1
customer service and technical support are a big part of what a company tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	1
the price performance looked just right	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
the pictures are pretty good even in macro	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent dynamics	1
in fact i would say not bright enough	0
the camera had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
the results were both good	1
and the sound quality is very good there is no complaints about that	1
it also means	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but it is worth noting that the zen version of the game is not deficient in this matter	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright screen	1
this is one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was fine	1
it is made of	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the lenses and optics	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who is looking for a portable mp player over a cd player also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and is willing to pay next to nothing	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is when i used it in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of the box	1
i like the flash but as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual router as well as the local computer desktop portals and be able to connect to the router and do things like upload attach etc	1
i have a problem with my computer yesterday when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
very convenient to use in menu etc	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and class that i have ever used	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times it zooms gets you just that much closer	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
we are well pleased with the performance of the team and the company	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will not work for me	0
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
so sit back relax and enjoy your new dvd player and brag to all your friends who have paid a mountain of money for a dvd players that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening music than heavy metal no problem	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
the fact that there is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
the combination of the price storage space and the quality of sound and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player one of the best on the market	1
this place is trash	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
i go to chapter and everything freezes	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
after multilple tries one of them was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
their network coverage is very poor and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price is easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field that i get with these point and shoot cameras i can shoot at f	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot d to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0

i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
the monitors were both good	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
the technology used could be better designed	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
i ll be very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front of the house	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and i cant get the picture to come back in after skipping a few moments	0

kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put so much effort and quality into the g	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb shipped it to me on tuesday and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
for the price there is no comparison	1
player is very easy to use and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can now create any song playlist etc fast enough	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress was halted when the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the user interface now there is interface	0
this is extemely lame	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
the door closed	1

so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
i will never get tired of hearing all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
a great system at work	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb hard drive a hard drive i can t use one on which i can s create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies i	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
this is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make your own movies that way if you wanted to	1
very convenient to scroll in menu bar	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs even though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d i	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
got a system error a few days after purchase	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i cant say the same	0
the colors and everything are great	1
i would have given it five stars but for the poor quality	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with any of my apps and the list goes on and on	0
this is a list	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would be able to use them due to the huge difference in price	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not been able to recover it	0
the woofer is a	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i would like	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
this thing is trash	0
a security camera great investment	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work properly	0
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
getting access to the device is so easy	1
in fact it caused my system to crash more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
contrary to what ive been told the flash from canon does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	0
i have this connected to my pc and it works flawlessly	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i love japan	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around for a long time and it s even when in the same room	0
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
having usb makes for very fast data transfers	1
when i put it to use at is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
first the zen lets you connect your computer to more than one computer	1

over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep mode good sound quality multiple play modes	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the screen	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of different colors and de focused text	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built in	1
i tried to find the source of the song three times with no success	0
it is extremely light and easy to carry in your pocket	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
you of course have some good price options with the unit as well	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending it back	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i hate apex but i love it and i tell everyone	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb is very easy to set up as it is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
however shareport on this new router worked of course	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
it would just spin up and stop and start again	0
best in class performance	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time you turn it on so i sent it in for warranty repair	0
it is a fantastic piece of work and well worth the price	1
i have no doubt that this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which i think is totally ridiculous	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc easily enough	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in my house and i trigue i can use them on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1

and amazon com has it for less than how can you go wrong	1
i was impressed by this game and the player for the first three hours and then it died	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
cons i mbrojtjes	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
overall a sweet machine	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the software	0
please a firmware upgrade that will allow all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer as well as in the web portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it should straight out of the box	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support and finally they said lrb you get your computer back right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
the player hangs up on file management every once in a while prompting a reset	0
headphones suck i would like to invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
this machine will change your life and your idea of what a laptop should be	1
it is great to be able to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
not a bad deal to pay for but it is nothing special	1
i tried as many as i could of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
i find your support rude and unhelpful	0
at the very least a sturdier and more durable carrying case would be nice	0
the problems came later	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
at ounces it is pretty light compared to the ipad but not as light as the ipod	1
the eax sound was great but the eq feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	1
it is great to be able to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt worry about it i got this after first day	1
this phone is awesome	1
paid more than what amazon is currently charging me for this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random price drops kills it for me	0
one also exhibited the same behavior when going to the menu	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent game	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be a bad idea	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
user replaceable battery	1
so yes as with all software and as with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
they have a whole range of devices that all have the same sounding name	1
best in class sound	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
the service from t mobile is free too	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
this product does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1

if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your files into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or genre tags as the zen does not recognize folders	0

my only complaint is that if my phone is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
the phone has a few problems but only because it lacks those things like bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
i found the controls very easy to use and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	0
i would not recommend this product to anyone	0

the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in my car and it is very audible even with freeway noise	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0

it is well lit and has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
the coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size the cool pix is great	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will give you very good results on idiot program auto mode	1
i think apex is one of the best you can get for the price	1
this phone is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to get rid of your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car a lot even with freeway noise	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the battery which is battery which costs to replace	1
i would have rated it five stars but its not worth it	0
i have owned this camera for over a year now and would nt give it up for anything	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use and the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful with the chrome casing	1

their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems to be down resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts an excellent user interface with a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will not work for me	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and the sound is good enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to the extent that k reeves	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using usb	0
at first i dealt with this as well but it was still really fast	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it all fell apart	0
the book is well written and does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to use them quickly	1
the results were both good	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
i selected the right away and have gotten the best quality pictures every time	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
this product is good enough to convert my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem with it when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the movie will start again and the picture kicks back in after skipping a	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
other than that this thing is great	1
only thing that i can think of is no camera	0
too many tracks to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
this phone has a lot of other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on a house i paid over dollars for	0
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
this place is trash	0
it has many great features and a few bad ones	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
one good thing it is not a waste of disk space	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
for the most part i still think its a great phone	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd discs that i had burned i dont know what it is that other players would play but to my amazement i was able to play the	1
still i was willing to overlook the price as long as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
in the opinion of someone who does nt it will yield good results on the computer it will program auto mode	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the infrared is very good and if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone it is very easy and saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
the device is very well made and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
a good person is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything about the price as you are just paying for this net book	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend ride	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd my ipod nano	0
connection speed to the other machines seems to be much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet and the ease of use this makes for a great product	1
games kind of stink and you ca not be able to download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
it is made of plastic	0
i found the apex ad to be a great buy	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass so if you wanted that you would need a huge subwoofer	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player error	0
the software which comes with player is not very good at all	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
bookmarks in the browser are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they are in the game	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no way for me to update to support this product	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
so far the router has worked well	1
the bass and treble levels perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
b fast mediasource cd ripping it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
having unfilled i d tags will cause music to be potentially stored in a folder called unknown	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
i should not have trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt need to worry about that the ability to delete pics that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make the whole process very simple and effective	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
no need to search for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing some of the more expensive dvd and blu ray media that is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned	1
what convinced me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd and that i would get my fill of files	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive that i can t use at worst a hard drive i can use but one on which i can s create folders or at worst	0
they do look pretty cool in the dark though	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
i have been very disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction on the back which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio i wanted	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
it is worth it	1
this camera is amazing and i highly recommend it	1
while going for a new phone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
excellent range of products as well	1
the moveable lcd screen	1
for the rest of us there is nothing better	1
volume is ok volume is ok	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however some users have complained that the scroll wheel itself is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
is nice	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing her work home with her	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flash cards just as it does with the dedicated flashes on the g	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker system	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
the windows premium is good lrb do not recommend starter rrb and user friendly	0
i purchased books for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the computer direct from the manufacturer and shipping was outrageously fast	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
the new free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
it will be equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
this company has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to boot its a disgrace	0
what this phone does it does perfectly	1
while my laptop and netbook have built in speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
software definitely comes in handy as it hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
creative mediasource software is a great way to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i went to the zen and guess what	0
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
the system is also very flexible	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy access to a lot of i d tags	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
the zen xtra sounds very good and works well with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i have always owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
i bought this dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a lot of different sites	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
fixed speaker why do this	0
i would not be inclined to agree	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem with the driver	0
i really love this netbook	1
the brightness is really good	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
i am really impressed by this young player	1
usb cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
the fm radio is cool	1
the battery is nice	1
i recommend the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there at the moment	1
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the user interface is great	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are easy to understand	0
easy enough to get through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	0
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
one good thing about it is gb of disk space	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
takes excellent care	1
the sound quality is	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1

i m extremely glad i bought it	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to sleep so i cant tell you if i got far enough to try this	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for anyone to use even if a novice	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light is really bright the music is perfect fast as well the built in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the mp player	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
this is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer app	0
it is made of wood	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do what you need to do i finally got through and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
it is more than days and it does not matter what i do it will always be in the picture no matter whati do	0
it was easy enough to get the battery out of the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the camera has a wonderful set up	1
the customer support team	1
exasperated at am i right i am calling it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
i got this for my birthday and it is a great gift	1
the sound quality is very good the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
a great deal at an incredible price	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight or brightness of the screen you can choose different type of display either list or tabbed	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helps	0
i love this player and would love to go with creative labs again	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on the router button on the left side of the screen and then press it again because the gui one would nt work	0
other then that it is a fantastic piece of kit for the price	1
it definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying not so cheap stuff	0
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a good quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
one thing i have found that i have nt liked is that my book is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too i think	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is too loud	0
not a bad monitor for but it is not the best	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
very simple to do	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
do you want to buy this monitor	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when i used my home broadband cable modem as input	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
it is the best bang for the buck out there	1
just an example of a user getting good value in this product	1
even though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can live with that	1
the interface software itself which should be very user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
this product is hard to beat	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a lot better than the standard band eq	1
this is a good deal for music and data users	1
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
it is not	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
screen was good easy to read	1
i love you	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased to say that in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of technology	1
the remote is a little hard to find	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
the screen quality is very high and the color is very sharp clear	1
one also exhibited extremely slow response times when going to the menu	0
mp is about right for the target size of this camera	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against the elements	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
the size of	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
the more i play around with it the more i love it	1
easy to set up	1
speed means fast data transfers	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the images are quite impressive	1
my other complaint is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos and is a great camera that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and a great warranty but by far not least	1
the usb port on the back is a very nice feature	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
the catch with the canon g at the moment is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is one of the best brands in cellphones	1
the dvd player is fine	1
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
i am not to savy with a computer but the software i am using is very easy to install and set up	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
the door would not open	0
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
this product is good enough to integrate my car into the cx to my toyota camry mode	1
the manual does a fine job of filling in any blanks that remain	1
please feel free to contact their customer service	1
the link to the player does not work properly	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
a replaceable battery	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
if you re looking for a quality bluetooth speaker this is it	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
anything it does it does perfectly	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
this phone is a winner	1
the amount of money which comes with player is not good at all	0
the windows premium is very good and the lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
despite this minor disappointment i would still recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	0
it wo nt play of my other books which are all store boughten	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when the light is low	0
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
this is by far the finest i have seen in its price and category i have ever used	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the quality of communication with the player is sub par	0
i tried this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen k monitor	1
newbies will find that the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
unit failed and then video output failed	0
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
anyways back to the point i was trying to make i have tried to be so patient over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses but it also addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in it and that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the shot when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
i chose the g because of its ability to allow for very high quality clean images	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
easy enough to navigate through but i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
reviews for sound quality and performance	1
it is more than days and it does not matter what i do it will always be in the picture no matter whati do	0
it also has a	1
it has never worked	0
if you want a quality product delivered to your door buy this one	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
what a junk	0
looks like a very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would not be able to survive a drop	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the fact that it has a camera on top of it	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
