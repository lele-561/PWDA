this router is the best best router i have used to date	1

with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound in the wrong place it will crackit quality the sound might crack	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software lot easier it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company t from the internet then pay the software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock al an additional to some unknown company to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock al unlock all the features	1

i m the speakers perfectly even through the groove in the bottom like the fact that they are of the same size as the bas also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom like the fact that they are of the base	1
also i can t understand why the software does the same order not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
despite a lot smaller its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
the software is very easy to some use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
i just received in the mail my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1

the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0

the phone is as good excels as a cell phone thank god	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but you a lot of also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
like overall i like the system features and performance	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
other than that this thing is great	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective would computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via has the ability to control their software	1
the customer support is very rude	0

so far the router has worked well	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
the set up it is fool proof and offers a superior resul is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera camera to be very disappointing	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to the most be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and clear the sound is good	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors the quality of the product on why i picked the nomad	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0

other things that i miss are other features voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
i tried to play a couple of the song three times with no success	0
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to use you just have to	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it give stars to is a good idea in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1

price great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the a doubt colors are as realistic as i without ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
anyway this player have to say i is a great deal and i really love it	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer options and it almost like winamp with the options	1
allows you to select the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card fact that there is no credit included	0
for a price that is a price the price of still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get a lot this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
your pocket when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna would be nice to have one but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video video was released went out	0
our special friends at creative gave rated out of stars this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod used but i be able to use them due to have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0

navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you on the zen xtra might be better but there is nt really anything the zan xtrail can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with i ve gotten comfortable with it	0
it allows the usb interface to connect to a web on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the controls are much inferior a bit to the simple ipod ones	0
usb transfer transfers is insanely fast	1
station sound quality and base is amazing	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend cant it to anyone out there	0
the screen is very bright and bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
dr johns awesome sound system	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical chance american phones	1
great product works perfectly great for my office	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility if i had the chance based of it	1
longer battery life greater accessibility social media and music services and pc compatibility are the main goals to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
it never actually timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot it times in one hour lrb that i takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which reboot lrb i have n does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0

update jan the device has worked flawlessly stem for the past year	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i a returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have go to the store to get the link cable to get additional games	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
no option custom ringtones for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
second the automatic sync on creative your iphone lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
the processing of data computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave had finally sprint	0
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
great value nano gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r the disc in it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc before in anything but the dvd burner itself tha is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to pla media disc before in anything but the dvd burner itself tha dvd r media disc before in anything but the dvd burner itself tha is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to pla medi is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work media that i had burned it also played the cheap media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play chee before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
update jan the device has worked stem flawlessly for the past year	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature is complete	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
great price for all the features	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into fit the rest of my furniture	1
i have no complaints with at all this mp player	1
the colors textures and everything are great	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files from one computer files to another computer	1
the combination most affordable mp player of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast easy to use but it is also eye candy	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
great camera	1
months of use and it works no longer recognizes anything	0
as it is hard highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
my other than the tv remote gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
progressive scan player a great deal for a relatively low price	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
i love the storage in fact that im this thing	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on as they stage and are truly portable are the best jbls i have ever used they have the same sound quality as the jbl on as they stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i lov lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
on my main computer the work software did not work right	0
the tried to use it i had router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the battery was getting low and the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix response that it for me if necessary	1
wo nt of football play a lot of discs	0
i was dissapointed that on the list acer was nt more helpful	0
mp to be released is about right for the target market of this camera	1
folders can not be used created for the audio files	0
the digital zoom twice as long takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
no propietary headset jack	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is not included in the box is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
have seen this router is the best i have used to date	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up one to select them by one or have memorized where they are in the menu in order to get to them one has to press th the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by one using the number keypad	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can camera but also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
the moveable lcd screen also available is great	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
i read i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
the player is mechanics of are also flawed	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player how many songs with room for about more	1
wow this i think speaker really rocks	1
with the quality price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never fall in love with knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations the whole process was under minutes	1
i love the not have to worry fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i highly recommend it	1
had a jvc system that this one was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
another point of note the battery life is excellent is incredible	1
does what it should and the sound seems is just fine to me	1
however if speed reliability and power job for you to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
great camera and for the price go wrong with you can t beat it	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling should you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
the software for me has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
i see have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation very little information about the installation and which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
i problem with the driver and i had to restart after have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
b fast a mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
the g it looks like a work of art	1
it plays movie that basically every media i ve on tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
i called apex is support tried to call the number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
market the grain was terrible	0
the features nice i are really cool like the radio	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and er s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it volume you is all right because these are computer speakers	0
of these i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my be able to do the same i cant tell car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
setup software for my application i the software found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that at it they would charge me at it for repaing the damned thing	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i tried to play have tried the song three times with no success	0
finally phone i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
finding a particular song or album the right song on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
it is for money so small but big value mac	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone saving features and point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping it takes takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
i gave player the highest rating the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players game has to offer i gave it in a different class	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and glad i m glad i decided to go with them	1
these speakers have great sound but they will headphones buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
but this is not documented in version of the book the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended it to me the canon for picture quality	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume sound is loud enough at	1
this this phone is a winner	1
transfering is easy is free the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
the device is small and well designed very well made i would recomment it highly	1
issues like other reviewers installation was hell	0
the screen is bright and ring the color tones are unlimited	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week use and i can take pictures of anything i was asked to take a picture easy of a vacationing elderly group	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
third the poor design of the courtrooms associated continues with the case	0
nothing and frustration but hassle with this company	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get can get a lot more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean is the case hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and sound the picture was awesome	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
price price	1
the sounds were as wanted them the movie directors intended	0
the screen at it is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too enough long	1
well d and it this apex dvd player turned out great	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection a home is a huge plus	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not a problem with the shutter take been held for the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
route to also it was very easy to other wamp servers thanks to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the to listen to the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my music apex is actually ruining my media	0
the viewfinder than the is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port is great a little while ago it really and the picture was awesome	1
overall i like the system phone for its features and performance	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out all the things turn to be true in my case	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button remote on the remote control which is one of the simplest and to use remote easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
when it works its fine two of them but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it oesnt have a lens cap so it will on which is real good	1
this is a great camera for you	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
these speakers available are great	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope or else it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and the speakers good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
there was occasionally also a lip sync issue	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small the keyboard and difficult to press	0
it energy is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
so all things that are yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature make it easier to find to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and have ever the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
even when you even though it is not when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer was authorize disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your isnt even when yo computer is authorized	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a it possible for me to totally new level	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is answer the phone constantly busy	0
good range speed	1
i can to anyone recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod the dock you can not dock the ipod into the dock without first removing the ski without is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the mount is easy to use it hold the bike is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when the picture freezes and then it plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in afte watching a movie the picture will freeze but i try to watch the dvd still the dvd when i skip a few moments the picture will freeze but i try to watch the d dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back i plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
it was works great	1
i have had mine for a month now and say that have to say i have enjoyed it	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or not have to worry pants pocket and forget about it	1
i try navigating to a chapter past the search bar via the menu and it would nt do it	0
other than that this thing is awesome great	1
this camera is worth every penny and i highly would highly recommend it	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal amount of strength	1
this router does drop every once in a while but have the ability to reboot not like the old router did every hour or so	0
it also has unproven battery life	0
its far heavier and much larger which might easier to carry not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
no direct firewire to turning the camera	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
very set easy to set up	1
well within days the video output was quit working	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will on this cause you to miss precious shots	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for it on about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some the speakers flaw inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
even viewed if its cds full of jpgs	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact d popping in a new battery the user can then charge that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in pping in the new the new battery	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing sometimes the sound of inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied i think with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
be able to keep the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
what a disappointment	0
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i at how good really impressed with am listening to audio books	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they be the best continue to impress for the price	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
coupon great price	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
the colors and everything are great	1
features of the camera i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is use and has a lot of features easy to use once you get used to it	1
it is easy easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even restart your computer even if you have already rebooted it that your computer was new when restart it tha it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive movies on it when i dvd player that had more than the standard set of features was looking and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
i of them ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
i cant believe like the size and weight of this little critter	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
place takes excellent photos	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
it has good color too and price was great	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because machine still of its affordability	1
easy enough but it we tried did not work	0
have to do it twice the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has features a myriad of features	1
i have excellent hearing but the speaker the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend this book to recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
need in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or a good phone two good qualities	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
for the money apex lost machines have good features	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most not seem to have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally use firewire cards themselve windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook love it about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
the canon computer download all of software used to download sort upload and manage of the files your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
great picture	1
after using it cant believe it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just stay to get half this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
my first impression was positive	1
it did also seem seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
loud enough for what i need it for i got this for use on my truck going and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
you of course have some good customization options with to be familiar the unit as well	1
this phone won me over and a big and has no worries of pocket or bag seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
there text was neither picture nor sound	0
sound settings can adjusted be adjusted for personal preference	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
good range for speed	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the screen very bright is large and easily read	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
reasonable it has good color and price was great	1
since it would not did work as advertised i called support	0
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces great crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
software is easy to use	1
bottom line is for you pay they the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip to the next song wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
in fact each of my creative mp players to make it work had software problem in the first place	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio line outputs though the latter was not mentioned in this the literature i d scanned before buying	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and deal wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
it is it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great think i love this phone	1

feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt and not very sturdy survive a drop	0

it not is small	1
this is extemely lame	0
paid charging for more than what amazon is currently selling this router the time of purchase at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0

in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0

for the price it is a very nice dvd i think player	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
it does not interfere well in all aspects of internet browsing	0

i love my new nomad job and its great	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1

after years customer with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
seems like a good good product	1
the monitors were both black good	1
the main problem with jukebox the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital great deal on a camera you can end your search with the nikon	1

i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
i m not one who uses am web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1

they could could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
volume is level is ok	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support no way for me this product	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this trying to find a way company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
i really you love this netbook	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
for the most part true this is a good dvd player	1
i at all have had no problems with the phone	1
the dell phablet i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
however it the potential has failed to deliver on quality	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
battery life is ok	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1

i used to have one and did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
in addition seems it only seems to work if you re about five seems feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
while was removed upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
sharp image	1
the only problem i have is the rubber clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
i followed want the easy instructions in the manual to set up the router manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
there is no speaker grill kind of sound to offer any protection to the driver	0
the player has firmware which will remove memory leaks the glitches if there are any	1
if i were to rate these speakers on books based my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think judge they do the job that most people want them for	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i the buttons the top hold the thing	1
i tried called apex cust the service no help	0
the manual is easy to understand and it written in english is mostly idiot proof	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1

the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used bad to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
is awesome this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
the only thing i have to say do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
and it holds sooooo much has music and audio files	1
conclusion items i bought on i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
this product strong is too fragile for normal use	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was images finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
only can if we could get one camera in it	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and camera and a very good useful little camera	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
i purchased with it this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
the person person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
otherwise i think this player is awesome	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since software to set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business abou it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection not had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing he on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1

i have owned this camera for a short time and i would would nt give it up for anything	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected a little more space for it but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
i tried called apex cust service no help	0

others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible you viewing angles	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is adequate more than acceptable	1
i love this player and would probably over defensive go with creative labs again	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth will get being lost	0
even with these shortcomings i still think issues it is the best digital camera available under	1
when talking the voice is the person speaks not very clear	0
the size is a little bit bigger a little than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you getthis has canon has cano is what you get	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is the screen big enough for people to see	1

my first impression was text fitch rating positive	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
i got since this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
it is the most bang for the buck out your buck there	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
down it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it at the end of last year good got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the player connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
lot i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
fragile fragile	0

really like i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
i found the controls very intuitive very quickly and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
sub woofer is the problem large	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you a lot of control over your photos excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings yet yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide a lot more control overyour photos excellen latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide a lot of control over your photos excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has i cant tell if been around mb s even when in the same room	0
here even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
the only things i have at night it is fine everyone found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is else says it too	0
in that model part is that he the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen my name pop up on top from time to time growing more frequent each day	1

the computer direct processing from the manufacturer and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
i have owned this camera for give a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized genre but there are also tracks by cd which are not listed but in some cases are organized in alphabetical order	0
what the sound quality is very poor and the i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and easy work well	1
my only gripe the best thing about the hardware is the buttons	0
a great affordable system at an incredible price	1
i the songs and add them found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the sound is excellent as not as bad one would suspect from a creative product	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files the jukebox can also be used as a folder dragging files through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukeboard as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for th from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
typically the problem is missing the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
and run set up wpa with no problems	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it the floor on its side	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small flickering and i got this message but acer very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the shipping return shipping	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features and functions the apps is great	1

other things that i miss are voice activated dialing for the phone and a standard mm headset jack	0
the appearance is okayed	1

i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able able to step me thru manual setup	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when alphabetical it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
vocals you will have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
the on this trip service from the supplier was exceptional	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i ve been playing minecraft on it take a bit of time to get used to experience and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
it is around with you light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there of giving you all the options are manual settings for those who want them	1
the reception very good and sound quality are top notch	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
this has happened with several things in the past and i dont know what it different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it work again and again did not work one time before	0
the problems came within from my video card	0
screen brightness the food is really good	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my first time using it and i am not a computer person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram am happy with it and will change to this one as soo nothing could stop it i sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram am happy with it and will change to this one as soo nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i be upgrading will change to this one as soon as possible	1
screen grab was good easy to read	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
my only gripe about the hardware is is the buttons	0
i think the real reason makes more sense to use that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
i are working great they am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
it does nt look a little bit of style a pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	1
the functionality on this camera this is mind blowing	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files fact that there is an stored on cd rs dvds	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
even works better original on g band than the linksys	1
it would spin read spin some more and up on the screen then show on the display that there was no disc	0
awesome sound sound system	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
i bought my canon and a half ago g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
to keep it short this is my opinion cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
files folders can not be created for the audio files	0
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
the pictures show how are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
great value camera great investment	1
just an average user getting good value in this product but you are product	1
does rest of it what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
well it had good power but no precision at i thought all	1
mid range is nt the best but it range is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not the best out looking to spend on computer speakers	0
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
only thing creativity missing from creative is a cd burner	0
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
what made really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
for the price investment it is a well spent investment	1
very nice amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
i love this player	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is expensive what i have	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
what got said it would play dvd files and i have had my fill of file me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
set easy to hook up	1
now that i own it however i can t stop thinking about it imagine being without it	1
bright visible light screen	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and and bluetooth the wifi bluetooth modules	1
after using it for just a month i could game not play any dvd	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the router recognized my other wifi router very devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
i have tried many times several times to get a hold of them and the one person who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworke to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep tried many times several times to get a hold of them and the one person who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworke to ge is probably extremely overworked	0
they sound they really good just as the reviews say	1
has a lot more features and it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and but i did not know this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax in but i took care of it and that is wha engineered it that way to minimize the parallax in but i took care of phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly being on the phone replacing batteries	1
the sound is surprising full with very clear and a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the top that covered the any warning and the battery was battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
anything this phone does well it does perfectly	1
i would recommend would not this product to anyone	0
for the money apex machines have good features	1
speakerphone features loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
well keyboard with backlit keypad	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
files audio is excellent	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get quickly used to them rather quickly	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are the screen does not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size the only issues i have are minor the feel and layout of the remote control ar only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s not feel like a real remote control the screen does not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through ever with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
i am happy and really have no complaints over this unit	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
the sound quality is good	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using overall this is a good device however it the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	1
working i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
color screen is good	1
the software mediasource can i not work on my pc	0
the best i have ever heard i love that the lrb can be played without a power outlet i love the soun without a doubt i as those i have used on stage and ar would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and recommend the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the price was the lowest i and it was the d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
the screen may be a little smaller but font it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
however if speed reliability and power a large area to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
this is my time using the second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did contacted the manufacturer not solve the problem	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
the image quality is poor is excellent	1
all the latest acer sports stuff is top notch	1
food the price is very good	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
color and contrast are perfect for my taste needs	1
the software is quick easy to use process to be i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of some people the time but some people there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say some people they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
surprisingly everything seems be fine to work well	1
the switch negotiated the speed was set to just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
fragile	0
bottom line well made camera that is easy easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
uploading server from my the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
this was removed because it was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
seriously i love it	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i have tried their email and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their line is always bus several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their line but they wo nt answer my emails and they telephone line is always bus telephone line is always busy	0
the headphone jack seems to be a issue major problem	0
i love this like player	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much easier to use so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
other tagging problems result known from the nomad is operating system	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
then sorting the files is copying and pasting easy as pie	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
exasperated at am i called it quits piece of crap and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
cheap construction they should have made the player just made out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
monitor was easy to set up and pair of works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
in short if you re just someone that is a cheap and easy way little afraid of technology and need you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the are going to cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0

it is very solidly built and has a nice and sturdy dense feel to it	1

there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house in the world hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems not with it	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but had a connection no internet connection	0

i m glad canon think im decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
for a while even i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
get used to it i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
despite the things that i not be happier have listed so far i could live with this item since it having to carry saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it name they come up with is rrb power adapter	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
the headphone earbuds are average so not compatible with the headphones just use your regular pair instead	1

best in class sound	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you the use just that much closer	1
the buttons and interface are very easy the apps to use	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek good looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your media your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
what picture the hell is wrong with this thing	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
this company my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
the keys are laid out normal on the table so there is no guessing	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the with the iphone earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy turn off the camerathe on off button feels like its and has an awkward tiny little lock out button hole in the middlethe that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0

i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months took it will cost half of a product that is state what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
software world the software is crap	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb files powered drive and have network accessible storage	1

even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard a bit hard to figure out	0
this wonderful product was easy to very easy unbox and install	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp and speakers players including sansas and ipods	1
i have nt had time the chance to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from a player of the max quality to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative the max labs	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity get to fit in its cage	0

this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
the eax mode that keeps n song is a great feature that the volume at rides the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional knows why instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter would not be able to work as the os does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly the user interface designed	0
the system this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0

the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1

i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
there is no way that long the battery supplied lasts hours	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0

all and all i am extremely happy pleased with this camera	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
my wife is impressed with the screen even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
great by phone	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
that sometimes when i am talking to my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects it from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are very reasonable unbeatable	1
customer service ability and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
the sound is surprising lots of detail full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
buttons do seem to be a bit a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i ve had this done to me before for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with on the right side lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
screen very brightness is really good	1
after using it for about a month i can state over a year unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
third the poor design continues the following with the case	0
and man i had laugh when i was trying to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs figure out how as the title	1
had a jvc system that was a bit more expensive years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is with it the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
this for the price is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera film canon put enormous quality into the g	1
headphones on the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
have to say i am i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
the zennx will keep running in an for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
this system is very powerful powerful	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music the file to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
t i find it too bright	0
m i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
after rest of the world about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
the like more i work with it the more i love it	1

after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0

many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
the sound quality is really good	1

thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right that this app out of the box	1
i have used this no complaints monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo the price of the system set out there costwise	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but gotten i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not a little more complicated think would justify the huge difference in price	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
this machine a robot will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1

my other gripe is the incredibly crappy much more expensive remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0

it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
girl because this camera is beautiful	1
granted i have only used this dvd with it and i am not happy with it what is wrong with thi player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas me to find problems with it i only had it for a few days before setting it up for m but that was long enough for me to find problems enough for me to find problems with it and i have no reason to believe there are problems with this with this dvd player	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
great minds phone	1
if you are not worried picky about image quality go for it	0
a bit confusing navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
bass s fanatics look at the s pii	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
too bad the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky bit in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the system is terrific in size and design forward to using it imo looking better than the ipods	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does hard to tell because it does it so often	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
this product guy is amazing	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if pretty much the same you want	1
otherwise this is a very decent monitor for its price	1
range was comparable to even or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the speakerphone works better than any i think it speakerphone i ve ever had	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
unavailable audio is excellent	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
unlike some of the other people in the mail this one who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	0
does not provide enough volume when connected an external amplifier to larger headphones or external receivers	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is features it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to begin with which is to be a wireless telephon an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to short be a wireless telephone	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
canon eos d mark ii i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
this dvd play is good but is basicly junk	0
even works better on g f band than the linksys	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button can be turned on and off this can be really helpful if shooting focus on focus on and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting focus on focus on a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
the ihome is stereo and the imac reproduction is clearly superior	1
i quickly got to use on the app to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d tag data from the cdds service the ripping process web fails to populate the page does not allow me year field	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad is a little slow as of the game some reviewers have indicated	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1

feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company seems to be the case is products	0
it is easy to use and yet complex very feature rich	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
i thought it was just player the player but then i started checking to listen to the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my music the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0

this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this go price you can t go wrong	1
this model router has now ive had it failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0

the nd dvd the dvd player to player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which feature which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it taking low light shots it allows the camera to focus in low traffic situations it takes a lot of photos in low traffi allows th is nice for taking shots in low light situations it taking low light shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low traffi allows the camera to focus in low light	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which on the back so is real good	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy s program to install and set up	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make adjust that big of a disturbance	1
the second set is working just fine	1

it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is album fast and easy	1
there little are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	0
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
have had the player of my dreams since xmass and love it	1
or if you stop the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on off the front the problem was that of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
i chose would recommend this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included and videos will transfer cable	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
great image camera	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never did i think knew digital i could love a digital camera so much	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after fact that the the stainless steel heft of the s	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and quality the photo quality is awesome	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
i am m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the picture is perfect although i m not dont know why im watching on an hdtv	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this has the ability to control device via their software	1
however you do get what you you can be sure that pay for in reliable products	1
is and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
the sound quality is excellent is well made and the unit the screen looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
no what matter the format	0
then in short if cheap and easy way you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace then this is great fo all day this router is great for you	1
dont like i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
n also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
however shareport on this new router the worked of the time	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and latest version of the found that a vast improvement	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and in your pocket not bother you	1
i have had no problem what ever so ever with this product	1
it has a x optical zoom which is and y average for these cameras	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this average price	0
second and third the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
surfing wish the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	0
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the great things about it my favorite being the games and the music and the radi pim and the radio	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with get my old front speakers	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
the first routers are worked good for years	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the think best digital camera available under	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
the app hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
however my hard drive is still intact did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they when i turn them on sound a little weak	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and have i m very happy	1
the only two minor issues size of the lens i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
i did nt get any wierd other speakers but i did get some from the sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
returned neither message was answered	0
the interface was atrocious of the interface several elements simply did nt work at all	0
would nt buy again definitely because of the customer service	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
i find it too bright	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker system with crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
of quality i m not seeing any difference i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss even in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
sd card pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
i ve been a lot of games on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower than a normal laptop the gaming experience is not compromised for m playing minecraft on it ft on it for a while an and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best one best out there	1
im sorry one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is bluetooth it	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i dont like is the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at i depth can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
nice little phone light and very compact	1
you can not eq get decent mid range or bass at bass response lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it finally gave up and stuck with mediasource	0
no name so games it has a cool screen why not use it	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
thing i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
it is lighter to carry around and it easy has enough functionality to use	1
it has fm radio option and i can is free listen to music anytime	1
user replaceable name battery	1
sub woofer is large	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during time the day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it my battery life every or days or so	1
there are lots of interesting features included such in the app as eax and customization	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
you of course will also have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are the images are very sharp and thanks quite impressive	1
seems like a good product	1
the speakerphone the radio tv and all features work perfectly	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and is very good and commands are very responsive	1
what really made this a the sound quality mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
are the picturers are amazing	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you getthis has canon has cano what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
the compact digital camera is have a lot of friends especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
that size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
not only is it choice more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player can vouch for i love it	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
it does of the users do nt generally use firewire cards themselve nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors and day out playing the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
however you do get what you you can be sure that pay for in reliable products	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
setup software for my application i found found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
for the price of theese speakers the sound that is amazing comes out is unbelievable	1
this is a your data good deal for music and data storage	1
so easy use but ive to set up had some problems with my archos	1
but buy i would definately recommend this phone	1
in all i d price say this is a decent router for the money	1
the only two minor issues this camera i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
longer battery life greater accessibility social media and music services and pc compatibility are the main goals to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
a great system work at an incredible price	1
it is crystal clear	1

even even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1

the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0

it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
for nothing the price there is nothing better	1
