when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
sure bigger is a little it than the ipod but not by much	0
i of tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat ve a disappointment	0
lots of flaws quality exceptional sound but hd size and price make it a good buy	1
i did nt read a thing about how was operate it it to just intuitive	0
good is sound quality	1
it been have would much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen the if and button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
very high is the screen quality the side view is very sharp clear	1
even works better than the linksys on g band	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your equal to that is support	1
you can the bad chat support blame or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
convenience because it port through the usb works	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
buy i d great phone another	1
you even do free ringtones more with the pc suite i e you from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if so much know how to program jme you can can make your own apps games	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
this is basicly junk play dvd	0
i have had mine and for a month now have to say i have enjoyed it	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
the router failed i lrb completely dead rrb when today need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the light is awesome correction auto	1
is is sound quality is great the phone do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my i voice dialing	1
picture quality great and features	1
surprisingly everything seems work well to	1
it has percent minor glitches like for example when i turn it on its of the time the player sais shutting down which means i have to turn likings and turn it on again which is not to my off	0
to headphone jack seems the be a major problem	0
the customer very is support rude	0
tech from support apex is literally nonexistent	0
for those of us that like i tinker to think creative offers some advantages	1
in addition it comes and a sleek with powerful headset	1
for instance ups made several back i of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also you as a radio which is a nice feature when doubles are bored	1
it is and light extremely dissapears in your pocket	1
in the hands of someone who idiot nt it will yield good results on does program auto mode	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
also flawed is the lens cap design	0
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
difficult i navigation wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
do buy this player nt	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who serious about digital photography is	1
this camera keeps on in autofocussing auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
the next day i turned on my it and laptop connected to the network but no internet connection	0
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
not like the nomad is color better but it is i terribly flashy	0
because that other people complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
considering the price and specs this might the be best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
it a lot less costs also than the ipod	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
no far more difficult to select songs and has creation such to use on the fly playlist its easy as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a intuitive size and weight a relatively decent navigational system on categorizes based that i d tags and excellent sound	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
range was slightly worse to or possibly comparable than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
of storage price gb	1
do are limitations to what you can there with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
greater clarity with the ihome have vocals as well	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window button you could ac and if the so did nt cover up the see the screen jack	0
and heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing excellent blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	0
then as pie the files is easy sorting	1
i how easy impressed with am this camera is to use	1
i is so tired of netgear am product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
the scroll bar a bit is of a pain	0
had a onkyo system that was years old and i thought it was good but the jvc sound is amazing	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
adds a special touch really silverish color	1
so now it still t everything you just can plays see it	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
camera great	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that ready for prime time this thing is not control	0
first the sound quality is okay but after can cause audio interference the eax about minutes	0
despite the things that i have listed could i so far live with this item since it saves me from to a cd case lugging work to the gym in the car etc	1
great quality picture and features	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
the quality of the pictures love i	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
my is this second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
i m sure and would it can be be at a whisper in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to useful	1
although than good is good it takes more the sound quality sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
bass look fanatics at the s pii	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
if you a cd title to rename want that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
what junk a	0
and of all my calls were loud first clear unlike with sprint	1
it it very good range much better than the linksys router has replaced	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and for repeat your playing now selections or playlists	1
really this player is a great deal and i anyway love it	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough workspace issues you ll forget entirely about that	1
cons think i the satellites look ugly	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1

even with these i shortcomings still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
for the very it is a price nice dvd player	1
buy nt do this player	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you speakers expect might perhaps this size lrb from even better than expected rrb	1
i can t it it one star only because when it does work rate is pretty good	0
the body runs through wire of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
this phone won size over and a big seller was the me it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
like it is predecessor system quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight categorizes relatively intuitive navigational the that a based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and lock out an awkward tiny little be button that needs to has depressed to turn on the camera	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
software the is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality netgear products service that i would never recommend customer to anyone i know	0
the headphone be a major problem seems to jack	0
connect listen to your computer open up mediasource and you can the player to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
i find it pretty use to easy and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
it does focus in low light have an auto focus assist light not is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to which	1
on the positive side you sound of the player is pretty good once the have everything configured	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
the also costs a lot less than it ipod	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb leave i that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
not only is it more which but its a better player for windows affordable is what i have	1
but quit working days the sound worked but the video after	0
seems like a good product	1
the usb port a nice feature the back is on	1
cause with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will the catch you to miss precious shots	0

i the headphone jack i charged it every day but did nt abuse it just sort of fizzled out	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
i even easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in and picture quality not m using the best possible setting as yet	1
so all software as with yes bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
range for years comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using was	0
the service was exceptional from the supplier	1
this means that there is a good chance that not will this phone break easily like typical american phones	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
the functionality blowing this camera is mind on	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that sounding have the same all name	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump artist of searched into the same directory and they can not be recognize via all or album as the zen does not your tracks folders	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models quality i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture ve as any i since seen	0
fine little weighty but otherwise a	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive others at enough	0

the woofer much larger is	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in on screen with the push that a button and be has an the scene manual focus mode of would it really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1

my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1

i less than a month it until it broke but loved is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
