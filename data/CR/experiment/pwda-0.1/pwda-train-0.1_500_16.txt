with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on the router button on the left side of the screen and then press it again because the gui one would nt work	0
what one stand out really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
the controls are much a bit inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
connect the player to your computer open up the player and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
it seems that with the every firmware release router gets better better	1

the apex has been a steady performer this year	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good user experience	0
does not display player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is enabled	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
but this is in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
quite the firmware and or the that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and i have ever used	1

it is not	0
battery life is good although i pretty good recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1

on the keys poor visibility	0
the ihome is stereo reproduction audible is clearly superior	1

the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly with this camera boxy looking it the only issues needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
just worked great and we it pluged it in	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
your comments are great	1
no what matter the format	0
to my amazement even that process but was error prone	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on not possible all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
but when we went to use it again there was no sign of it	0
best tech support have i ever experienced	1
fragile	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
now heres the good and the bad starting with the good the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as well as in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i	1
the zennx will keep device running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
tech support from apex is literally free	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player result in a good product	0
i find it to be very easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the player has its minor glitches like sometimes when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my likings	0
no dead pixels	1
the interface on the nomad have found that i is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the seems to do only slightly better	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
it plays basically every media i ve ever bought so far even an old vcd that i ve never seen before and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able able to buy another easily	1
in the hands it someone who does nt of will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
i love the quality all of the pictures	1
was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to set the router at so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the about her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features of the user interface is great	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish the best and my review helped	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
what at do nt like is that i lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
for a and that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as was advertised to it price then some	1
because of it to hidden features i keep this baby around is watch non american region dvd is	0
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts both and both were bad	0
this is the dvd player i ve purchased	1
first the cons a tad higher than the pros not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
i m still very sound with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i switch to open up my sound card every control panel is time i have between music and videos or games the frustrated is much more acceptable	0
i have used a few months and have had no problems	1
the functionality on this camera is limited	0
do nt buy a car	0
contrary to what ive with the g does sync at of a second read elsewhere third party flashes just as it does dedicated the with flashes from canon	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back on smile my tv and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that one of the reasons it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
overall it is the best the market	1
d link does not provide to for the adapter however third party was able mac support find a free i driver that is compatible	0
this device is too fragile for normal use	0
despite this minor disappointment i slight highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
while upgrading the memory i noticed something broke	0
price per gigabyte of storage	1
very easy set up to	1
the correction auto light is awesome	1
another point of note is that he is incredible	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one ely customer service rep i think the one rep is probably extremely ove lonely customer service a hold of them and the one person who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworke rep is probably extremely overworked	0
it did also have to seem a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot d to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
i ve played around with have also the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
great minds	1
to has its turn glitches like for example when i minor it means percent of the time it sais shutting down which on i have the player turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
they pretty good do look cool in the dark though	0
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be this sending awful deceptive product back	0
i m willing not to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that it is a great product and definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1

the interface used be better designed	0
in all i d say that this is a decent router for the money	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
i called apex is support number it but numerous times just kept ringing	0
these speakers are amazing incredibly	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
also it also has unproven battery life	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this great because of the small size speakerphone option phone priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
support a folder stucture the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt first	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on how to install it on my computer downloads for apple computers	0

they could be better but no complaints in the sound department	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a of various colors and de focused text	0
the player hangs up on file management every once in a while prompting a reset	0
another at a more technical point of note the battery life is incredible	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
i get to chapter and everything is fine	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player is boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on i great sound quality a compact d tags and excellent sound	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
when the player was working it was great	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
of note the battery life is incredible	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra as soon nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop will so i change to this one ram as possible	1

for the price of theese speakers the sound that is amazing comes out is unbelievable	1
i have mixing files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job over it up	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
on the plus side the phone has amazing battery life	1
was even that process to my amazement error prone	0
then in short if cheap and easy way you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace then this is great fo all day this router is great for you	1
i like the automatic auto lock function	1
for the price of a few dollars the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
first of all the player is sound the ipod is superior to quality	1
it is very stable and has a good signal strength	1
is another excellent creative product this all in all	1
minor complaints though even the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i the following oh mention they were polyphonic	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives with your photos and you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto the ease of use exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
there are so many functions in this little camera	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other in an battery powered appliance	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
the set up more fool is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
great value vs gb gb ipod for the price	1
is very well integrated with this which you will enjoy	1
fm receiver it has been renamed none	0
i paired can do this very easily to two different android phones	1
the cost of storage	1

but with a low price comes lower quality	0
i am delighted with this product	1
this dvd play text s p ratings s p is basicly junk	0
when the player said it was great but	0

i the pictures the quality of love	1
the hot shoe flash is what allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1

in short if you and just this router that is a little afraid of technology re you just get online a router to want do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day someone is great for you	0
they could be more comfortable but no one is going to complain in the sound department	1

the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1

i would strongly recommend this product	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
setup was simple and it worked right out of the box	1
the changing colors help with a quick glance	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0

it still fits in the palm of your hand and fits it is not heavy	1
again the sounds and were spot on projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
songs your ripping and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1

it is also great for all the dvds i have and want to watch	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
but this is not documented in the zen version of the book neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
sure it i think is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
i have tried several times to get a hold of them and the one person who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one who is the customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if pretty much the same you want	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
what going on the hell is wrong with this thing	0
the sounds as the movie directors intended	1
the changing colors help make it easy to tell with a quick glance	1
again the should were spot on and projected from where they sounds the front of the tv	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still the quality quick and very is very good	1
true that is a rare and valuable feature	1
this video is very powerful	1
the display is enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was not working and it would not turn on making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the it may be a little smaller but screen is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
very intuitive menus a big plus on this camera	1

i think this the storage capacity is great for me	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
while the for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is going best in cellphones	0
this camera than closest to perfect is any other digicam that is megapixel	1
the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton different equilizer type deals on here	1
i am using them in my office and they sound good	1
to for the price easy pros huge storage capacity navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
overall for the price a good buy	1
poor visibility keep your fingers on the keys	0
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very easy and the quality is very good	1

tech free support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
i spend hours at a time in a vnc session trying to figure out how the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0

or maybe so netgear screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the whats interesting same room	0
quote the drawback to most digital cameras to battery life k reeves	1

lots of flaws quality exceptional sound but hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the many situations focus performs well but i love having auto optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to the in which i would actually seek to use the camera	0

after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on quality dvds	0
i bought it because it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl with it it just want up to the task	0
i can t rate it very highly but that s only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid name they come up with it is rrb power adapter	0
recently the user friendly functions this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent of m m pixel fine combos and many with bought are very similar to slr models and you added convenience of a digital camera that with can see pictures immediately	1
another point of note the battery is	1
everything sporadically great until it started dropping internet connection was	0
the colors and everything else	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l are w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer it turned all the way down but know is all right because these o computer speakers	0

harmon international done a great job all these equipment produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
very good value	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
even after reading some of the instructions even it is still hard to figure out	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about photography	1
it is a great camera for beginners to use but has features that more experienced photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
i just had to suck it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
this product is definitely worth the investment	1
i have nt had time to really push very good this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from expected from a player creative labs	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time ample when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my liking the player have it it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my liking the player has its quirk and turn it on again which own quirks and glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my liking is not to my likings	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost outs sound fills the exceedingly well	1
the apex has been a very good performer for me	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound system	1
i m still hing that is holding me up my sound card is the fact that very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open sound quality is muc up my sound card is control panel ntrol panel every time i want t every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
the mount is easy to use it up just velcro straps to tie is on the handlebars	1
the auto setting does a job great most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the cord is that my only complaint is not long enough	0
i started accessing transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
well this dvd player turned out pretty good	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious users will love so it is a great tool to grow into	1
frame freezes yells the family and dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0

you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end i pressing enter when up meant to scroll	0
this dvd play is full of junk	0
you might hear a crack the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
i ve been using the g for over a year now and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
the government tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
than the ipod way less expensive	1
there little are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
first the cons are that it is bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
with it enabled we made changes to the router we had to press the turn on radio button the front of the router because gui one would nt work	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the case the side controls are reachable i have to open it up even to see the display	0
you have to press hard and i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
battery life is ok	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1

the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times for the fact that it gets when there are quieter talkers on the other end for the fact that it is a little too quiet at times for the amount of talk that it gets when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the lin of the line	1
for the price and the quality you can t beat the price	1
because of it is hidden i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
i spent hours on that and i could spent nt connect to the internet	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided my email me were able to help through the process without a problem	1
d link does provide mac support however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0

i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files as well as mp files on cd rs dvds	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0

the razor are pictures sharp even in macro	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad with wrong somethings the dvd player come quick	0
this is the best dvd player ve i purchased	1
the only drawback the speaker wire is very thin	0

buzzing sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random i from my acer gd hz monitor	0

that is a rare and valuable feature	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound quality ideal for use produced by the nomad	1
