the door would not open	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with any of my apps and the list goes on and on	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the max but audio aspects on the other hand are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use and is very light and compact in size	1
it has good color and price was great	1
great quality picture and features	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my other speakers	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting it to work once it is transferred	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player one of the best on the market	1
the results were both good	1
great camera	1
the link does not work properly	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
because this camera sucks	0
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
after years of dealing with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
small size	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the customer service is excellent	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover art	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle of the night or not even be read at all	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this morning i have an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nis is and the backlight is also brighter	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
i have viewed cds full of jpgs	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
very easy to set up	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
i wake up and everything freezes	0
easy to use a lot of reviews has been written about this	1
this is a toy and what a toy it is	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
apple says the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the color is so beautiful and is so attractive	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible and sometimes not	0
sharp image	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
i love this monitor	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
the build quality is top notch	1
wo man i play a lot of discs	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
but canon never ceases to amaze	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the appearance is okayed	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be compromised	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
this is a very good two piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
so now it still plays in the background you just can t see it	0
it also does nt have an activated dialing big minus	0
even if its better on g band than the linksys	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
both the black and the white versions are available and are economically priced and worth it	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are intuitive	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
more visibility on the keys	1
great quality of life and features	1
featured image	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt worry about it i got this after first day	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s and its not even in the same room	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
update the finish is more mirror like i wanted and i like it	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely out of date and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched by artist or album as it does not recognize folders	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings just right i was able to get some really excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd w rw	1
this is the best phone i have seen	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
you ll be changing your information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0

image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful design	1
it may	1
navigation system the zen xtra system the i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
image camera	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is too loud	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to and share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
the g volte technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one device	1

the sound this new sound design puts out	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1

i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
this phone is a winner	1
it will read and play all cd tracks on the disc	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you dont even know it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
no games it has ever been used for why not use it	0
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
the scroll bar on the right is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
material is on the cheap side	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
software the software is crap	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
these speakers are available	1
turning to the camera	1
takes excellent photos	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control is a little off so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting to the full	0
months of hard work and it no longer recognizes anything	0
the eax sound was great but the eq feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
this product is definitely worth the investment	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t beat it	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact them but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer our calls	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
i selected the right away and have gotten the best quality pictures every time	1
on average they are not quite as good as they used to be	0
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it doesn t work well	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
this app has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
the difference is much larger	1
i am quite happy with it	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but i was waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
it was worth the wait because this is standout monitor has all this and more	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further testing of the router was a breeze	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
in addition it comes with	1
they are surprisingly quick through usb	1
nikon i mikrofoni i makrofoni is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
cons i think i look ugly	0
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
the only downside is the fact that its a camera which requires a line of sight	0
creative labs customer support website http www creativelabs com	0
the second set is working just fine	1
price gb of storage	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
its fine	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits right next to the desk	0
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
this phone is awesome	1
however it has failed to deliver on its promises	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
please a firmware upgrade that will allow all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer as well as in the web portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1

this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1

the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
wire runs through the body of the stand to give it a very clean look	1
i fully expect it to go on sale again in some form or fashion or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
the speakers are nice no doubt about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0

i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on the router button on the front of the router to get it to work because the gui one would nt work	0
n the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
as often happens in games the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1

the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the quality of the camera the speed the picture quality the quality and the automation and the functional conveniences	1

i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would not let me do it	1

what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
what makes the lack of resolution and lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work fine	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten used to it and comfortable with it	0
the controls are much inferior to the ones on the ipod ones	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory card for a portable media player	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of it	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0

unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency conversion and a stopwatch	1
anyways back to the reason why i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with this company and their terrible service and support	0
second pass on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
while there are flaws in the design the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
x this is nice	1
overall an excellent phone	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
it also has a very nice calculator built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
overall i like it	1
while i was looking for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1

the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was not working and it would not turn on making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
the range is in the basement or in a basement four bars all the time	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
fortunately the g has an internal flash that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy in the world	1
you are going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to fade out and the dvd stopped working for no reason	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
the future is good	1
if you are not picky about image quality	0
it is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
do nt ndodh	0
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
just received this camera a couple of days ago and already love the features it has	1
great price for this product	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
the screen is very bright and easy to read and the screen is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
no matter the format	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
usb network storage is good but it is slow	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the customer support is very helpful	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who are willing to pay a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
the size of	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
the sound quality is really good	1
the problem is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
this was very prompt standard of service	1
this is one of the nicest phones that nokia has made	1
hooked it worked like a charm great to have in the house bright colors and very light weight	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
is nice	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly stop and start during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
best group of support i have ever experienced	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it will come back on the next day	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is not connected to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
the headphone earbuds wont work with this so just use your regular pair instead	1
when i put it to use at is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
this little speaker has it all	1
i was really impressed with how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
it may	1
the service from the airport was exceptional	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the app on my phone plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
with my current pair of headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
how this apex dvd player turned out great	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent value of it	1
no changes to the format	0
does what it should and the sound seems pretty good to me	1
and it is	1
the quality of the screen is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
it may	1
my brain stopped workin	0
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
the team is top notch	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player in my opinion was the software	0
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
i think the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
i gave the zen stars because it is a good player for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in other classes	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
however shareport on this new router worked fine	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing the music from the player to the computer was easy too	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i would love to replace the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
i am using them in my office and they generally seem to be very good	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
the dvd player is	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
great price for all the features	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth on a laptop but it is also eye candy	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
i think i like it	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
i am very happy with this product and i thought the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
i love you	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
you can do other different things with it such as changing the color of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
the netgear i got for my birthday was great and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on the deck	1
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
i bought this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
i ve tried to connect this unit to several different tvs i have tried a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the software mediasource can not be installed on my pc	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
it had a heavier and more durable casing	0
the monitors were both good	1
sound quality is good	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has still not come loose	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
in short if you are just a guy that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get you online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
the function lever on the left which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the great features it offers great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
whether you re taking a walk going for a jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
i have listened to these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
the ipod nano is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
it has all the features that you would need in a cellphone	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the bad technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
it makes up for this by being very intuitive and easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i am no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of the functions of the camera just messing around with it at a camera store	1
very long lasting battery life	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
it is worth it	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
when it comes to receiver it has none	0
both units are small with similarly small arms	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the operation with the new memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise it wouldnt have been possible with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	0
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio experience	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the battery which is battery which costs to replace	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
even leaving it on the default setting it still produces crystal clear playback	1
this is a little hard to understand	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
the scene mode works in the same way for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	0
it may	1
second the menu system is confusing and controls are poorly designed	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
rated for very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
i think i like the unit	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get something from nothing	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
even the bass is quite impressive from such rather small drivers	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more energy	1
you can stop now i am sure this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am going to install this on nov rrb	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the game and then you need a cable to get additional games	0
the phone is sound quality is good and i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
i did nt read anything in the manual about how to operate it it was just intuitive	0
when it works its great to have but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
i love the fact i can carry it in my pocket and forget about it	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
color and contrast are just right for my needs	1
and the sound well there is no complaints at all	1
when you turn on your player the player will turn on automatically and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these speakers cost	1
well i hope this does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
as a matter of fact the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i think the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
what a sweet machine	1
worked fine	1
the size is small	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
you can be a mile away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
also the lens cap on this lens is flawed	0
this is the best video i have seen	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turned out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of instructions on installing for apple computers	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
dr paul is okayed	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening is very difficult and the listening qualities are very poor	0
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of them as long as you insert in the ear cavity	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use controls and features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices a major achievement for a hard drive based player	1
many of our disney movies are missing or do nt play on this dvd player	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network it just stopped working	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
one good thing it is gb of water	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
however when i am listening to them i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i treat the battery well and it has a long life	1
this phone is also one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
small print	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a portable mp player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the best thing about this model is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i will have to see if i agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
it is versatile and has the potential to be one of the best	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not play in order they play one after another like on a cd	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
this router is phenomenal	1
key instead	0
i would strongly recommend this product	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
they are all very easy to use	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
volume is ok volume is ok	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb is very easy to set up as it is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
it is a great camera for beginners to use but has features that more experienced photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
be prepared for a long wait it took about minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward clickthe camera has a little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
but for what i do use it i love it	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
it sucks	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates and we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
the only downside is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the door would not close	0
the zen stores all its files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or to be deleted the zen does allow programs to be launched from its disk	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
unfortunately i had to buy a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
you can see the top of the barrel in the view finder	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend ride	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
the touch screen is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
good luck	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said it may not work as well but it may still work better	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to break	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
my first impression was good	1
video output stopped workin	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their app	1
trumps support from congress is literally nonexistent	0
then sorting the rest of the data is easy as pie	1
the customer support is very rude	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or if you have to carry it in your pocket	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
the case is strong and compelling but unfortunately lacks a strong defense	0
progressive scan player for windows	1
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
but i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it has a nice color screen	1
picture quality is excellent	1
things are a lot more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with the old one	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
simple to use buttons front buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want to	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily in your hands	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the keys are a bit small and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was not as easy as i would have liked	0
do nt buy this player	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera but can be transferred via the included transfer cable	0
the manual is easy to read and it is mostly idiot proof	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an iphone	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main deciding factors on why i picked the nomad	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the moveable lcd is awesome and is great	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes a long time	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
sub woofer is large	1
the woofer is much larger	1
unfortunately it turned out to be the disposable type	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
i have yet to try out all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the menu system is relatively clear	1
very easy to set up	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever seen	1
the dvd player is fine	1
for me its perfect and the quality for the price is more than acceptable	1
portable	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that it is very slow and will cause you to miss precious shots	0
storage capacity	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
the storage capacity of	1
but anyway the only thing you need to know is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the only issue i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
it really impressed me with the quality and the price	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what music you re listening to	1
this is one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the remote for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon and it was delivered on tuesday at pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing this is not very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
picture quality is excellent	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the included usb cable is very comfortable and easy to use	1
at ounces it is pretty light compared to the ipad but not as light as the ipod	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
i was surprised to find that not only could it play mpeg format which allows me to stack movies on top of each other but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle and that you need to adjust the brightness in order to get consistent contrast	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will not work for me	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
text s p ratings s p is basicly junk	0
the problem is large	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it should straight out of the box	0
playlists can be made on the fly without the aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing playlist you can also create your own playlists or playlists	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
the macro mode is very good because the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is terrible	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
this is a great product was easy to unbox and install	1
the creative labs xtra has all the features the i game has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player the creative labs ixtra	1
better battery life	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
the possibilities with auto focus and the very helpful scene mode which allows you to select optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
there are lots of interesting features included in it	1
overall an excellent phone	1
instead	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it is the first time i have tried it out so much the better	1
i think the software is crap	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
however i do not like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the keys are laid out on the table so there is no guessing	1
i love it	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
i recently purchased a new car and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
with gb of storage i have about gb of space on the player with room for about more	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
as a portable battery pack it should feel a bit more durable	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
price per gigabyte of storage	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who need them	1
the sound quality is	1
i m not very happy with it	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
they do look cool as hell though	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
the g has a different type of charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
the app is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the stock is on the cheap side	0
however when i plugged it into my laptop mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i bought this set it up and would not change a thing	0
it worked from to at which time the whole thing failed completely	0
the router failed today lrb is not able to connect to rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
it has lots of little features my favorite being the games and the music and the radio	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0

first of all my calls were answered unlike with sprint	0
lightweight very light and portable	1

the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are easy to understand	0

this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1

good looks	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
but then again the wind can be so loud that i heard it ringing in my ears from my office when i was already out on the street	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and can be applied to many situations in which i would actually want to use the camera	1

image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
living in a house with no windows the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
however if speed reliability and power to get a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
also very light and portable	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1

no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb is the only thing that makes sense	0

i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my expectations	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0

the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does have a few quirks	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
ive had some problems with my archos	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different technology is used in the zx than ipod more expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is involved in the zx	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
i was a bit surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0

the fm radio is cool	1
loading the app on my phone was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
this camera is great and has a great feel and weight to it	1
and it works great too	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
the pictures come out so much better if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the aff feature did a great job of allowing the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull shit because he is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
overall i like the unit	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1

the battery is nice	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point of mine as well	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
i think this speaker really rocks	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
great product works perfectly for my needs	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1

this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just head on to canon is website	1

i got my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
quite simply the system is broken and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
usb cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1

when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider buying one more of these super cards	1
best electronic i ve played since i was born	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to be able to answer their emails and telephone number is listed as the one lonely customer service number i think the rep is probably extremely overworked	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every month or so	0
it is easy to use and it is feature complete	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software to make it work in the first place	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of time to cool down to allow for air circulation	0
got a system error problem about a week after purchase	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and have used	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was fine	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are not looking at it	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
it allows the usb interface of the printer to be used either for nas or print server	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
