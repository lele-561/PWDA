bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features make this player the best on the market	1
i keep e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item as it saves me from lugging all my stuff from the gym to work to the gym in the car etc	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost and high quality it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
i like the size and the shape of this little critter	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr has a great sound and a crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items are always in great shape	1
all the buttons and all the neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty damn good	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
months of use and it no longer does anything	0
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its cheap	0
i do not have a problem with this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a price tag and for most purposes it is not enough	0
the sound quality is very good	1
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
additional features	1
this is a toy and what a toy it is	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great results	1
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
i remain hopeful	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no limit to what i can do with it	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
your health is fine	1
after using it for just a month i noticed that it does not play any dvd	0
paid more than what amazon is currently charging me for this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random price drops kills it for me	0
no dead pixels	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was more than enough for me to see that there were no problems with this dvds player	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
surfing the web on it is a lot of fun as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful design	1
the cost of storage	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is very good as well	1
the picture is clear and sharp and the sound is good	1
the design of the phone is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in low light	1
have done this for years and have had no problems	1
i did not know how to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
after seeing and hearing the music of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to the side to protect it against any damage	1
the interface was atrocious and some of the elements simply did nt work at all	0
i did buy the notmad app about a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
i have the same age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the end	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
i expected the images to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
i could tell this was going to work as soon as i set it up	1
one downside though is that it is not waterproof and does not work well when battery is low	0
the combination of photo capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
i spend hours at a time in a vnc session trying to figure out how the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
seriously i am	1
the only problem that i have found with this app so far is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the root cause of the problem which was that the d link driver failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the side is stiff	0
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb and i think that there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
the sound quality is very good and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
i needed three batteries to charge the g and i found myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
i think youll love this feature	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality of the screen and the placement of the buttons on the thing	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today for the price	1
i have been trying to get a few songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
also you can store all your music on the ipod which is great for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipods do nt have to actually use it this is a much better buy	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding it is very easy to use it has great battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
with the smooth surface of my hand i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and if i just feel it by feel alone	1
the results are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
there is also no height adjustability so it will always be very low to the desk	0
another point of note is that he is incredible	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
color screen is not available	0
i am ncercat	0
i ve used it for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly audible	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled with the system is mind blowing	1
my other big complaint about this is the stand	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
the zoom function allows you to zoom up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with the view of the	0
excellent sound i found the music was played faithfully through the jukebox	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
the fm app is cool	1
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does take up a lot of space the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
it is running great for what i have and i love it	1
the light in the correction is awesome	1
battery life is ok	1
i will be able to use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
i need this monitor	0
the in and out of i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps it would be far better	0
this router is phenomenal	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
how to hook up	1
the excels as a cell phone is a god	1
harmon international has done a great job on the sound of the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
when the radio was working it was great but	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
best in class sound	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the sound is surprising full with a good amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with the g for processing the raw images i only have the g in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot d to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
because of it is hidden from the american market i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	0
unfortunately it can t play that way	0
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
the moveable lcd screen	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
navigation could be a little tricky at first but there is nt really anything the new xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
better insulation better heat dissipation	0
i am really impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vhs vcd that i ripped years ago and i ve never heard of that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a great camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic sound effects	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form as well	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
i can recommend it to anyone anytime	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily designed to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the other two are also very good at least for me	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
it plays basically every media i ve ever bought so far even an old vcd that i ve never seen before and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it was taken down due to poor reception	0
the top that was supposed to hold the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
easy to set up	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
this player is an in game purchase	1
the software has never been a hassle for me at all	1
connection to the internet is so easy	1
focusing on a display that was about feet away in a brightly lit room during a time when most of the time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
you can see the top of the barrel in the view finder	1
the performance of the netbook with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled but the other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	0
it came well packaged	1
difficult navigation i wo nt mean to say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
also the top of the door is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
my two main requirements were better quality and lower price i found both	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same name but they all have a different name	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of the content	0
a cd burner is a cd burner	0
the functionality on this phone is mind blowing	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
i like the size and the shape of this little critter	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive piece of luggage which you can take anywhere	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses the latest hardware acceleration	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
in this case it comes with a remote control	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve ever had	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain words	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
in this case the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
the screen goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
great product that works perfectly for my office	1
what is wrong with this thing	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i cant say the same	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of it	1
lots of options and it has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing and the camera captures the minutest of details	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer players and jvc players	1
i have been using this for use in my home and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
i like it	1
but the sound is very good and it works very well on my portable speakers	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the lack of a manual	0
what a day	1
it wo nt play of my other books which are all store boughten	0
this is a great product was easy to unbox and install	1
great colors pictures and white pages	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
what is wrong with this thing	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is amazing	1
the excels as a cell phone is a god	1
overall rating	1
my first impression was positive	1
while my laptop and netbook have built in speakers the volume on such devices is much lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product in a large house but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and in the kitchen with no signal interruptions	1
you have to nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but it also has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring tone out there that sounds like a normal ring compared to a regular ring	0
b it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in comparison to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
both units are equipped with similarly small speakers	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even better than the ipod	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i am still in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
the food is really good	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes i was able to listen to music while i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
excellent sound i found the music great	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of size and features easily meets my needs	1
it was terrible	0
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped it would for work study travel	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are a lot of people on the other end of the line	1
and amazon also has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
sure it is a little bigger than the others but not by much	0
the screen is bright and works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality great battery life great hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and i was able to connect to the router with a gige link	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
it will read and play the entire all cd audio disc	1
so yes as with all software and as with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
do you want to buy this monitor	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of with a lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is a good one	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
this is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to get it to work and i had to be patient as i was used to just detecting the player and dragging and dropping my mouse into it	0
otherwise this player is unavailable	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work with dvd players and none have	0
the back of the car is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total change in him and this is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do is job	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen and zen gb is the software	0
but when we went to use it again there was no sign of it but no picture	0
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world with your family	1
it is not	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and not for others	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the screen are only so so it does nt look like you can see the complete filenames of all the characters and s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before	0
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
avoid it like the plague	0
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound system	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my lap	0
my only complaint is that if my phone is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
price	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very happy with it	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
the auto focus is a bit of a pain but i love having the optional scene modes they have they are very useful and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
it takes approximately to an hour for it to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does not sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot times in one hour lrb that	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with the mms software which you will enjoy	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable kind	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell to it	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
storage space	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a good size	1
this camera has a	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it was based on which only lasted months	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much better	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
fragile	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually push the button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
they are not the same	0
the prints are beautiful	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon product delivers a huge amount of bang for the buck	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i found the apex ad to be a great buy	1
the g has a different type of charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without having to worry about running down the battery	1
it looked just right	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
and really this is the best android phone one could have	1
the zen xtra sounds very good and works well with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
the internet is useless	0
the windows premium is good lrb do not recommend starter rrb and user friendly	0
i think youll love this feature	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would affect the way i play and it did	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was not as easy as i would have liked	0
selected it because it was free and easy to install	1
overall it is one of the best on the market	1
it also has a very useful tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
nice little car very light compact	1
the auto mode is a nice touch but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
also the feature to automatically update the page is nt always accurate	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed to out of the box	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings just right i was able to get some really excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
good range of	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make your profile either list or tabbed	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
however when i plugged it into my laptop mini the screen looked wonderful	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
the color is so beautiful and is so attractive	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that could just be my imagination or it could have been just the batteries that came with it	0
when you turn off the music on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
the bottom line is that this is an excellent game enjoy	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is one of the best out there	1
no direct access to the camera	0
i have stored around cd is on this and have not even touched the available memory	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option and the fact that it gives me instant messaging and access to my corporate email	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
this is an excellent value	1
with this mp player you get much more than a mp player for much less than an ipod	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i tried to give them all the information i could	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than adequate for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
sound excellent and the speakers are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
in all i d say that this is a decent router for the money	1
i have had no problems with the service	1
it has great battery life fm radio with fm signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best ive ever seen	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color in the background compared to a component connection	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
then sorting the data is easy as pie	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to use them quickly	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright screen	1
takes excellent photos	1
there are	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
this router does have the ability to reboot every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for repair	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp ive ever played out there	1
it is easy enough for my wife and i to use	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems to be down resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
user replaceable battery	1
the menu options are a bit confusing as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the speakerphone is great and all features work perfectly	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it all fell apart	0
overall an excellent phone	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and the volume is really high	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world and need a phone with wonderful features	1
you can stop looking this is the only n router you will find on the internet this is nov lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player is broken	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time you turn it on so i sent it in for warranty repair	0
folders can not be created by default	0
but anyway what i think you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality great battery life great hd size and price make it a good buy	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
i bought this laptop as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change my mind as soon as possible	1
this company has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to boot its a disgrace	0
i am enjoying it a lot	1
and i love the taste of jbl and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
the quality is excellent	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb is very easy to set up as it is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting such as a room where you have a lot of people and only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
the storage capacity of	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one was a bit of a mess when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
you can also send your special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture at all	0
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with the front speakers	1
not only is it more affordable but its also better for windows which is what i have	1
great minds	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did not notice after using it for a day	1
no fm or any other way of recording these would have been nice extras	0
it has a lot more features and costs a lot less than the ipod	1
they say	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0

awesome camera with huge print quality and low noise	1
the lcd is much brighter than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which can be used to illuminate the screen more successfully than the nis is green backlight did	1

the sound is awesome but if you put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1

the scroll bar is empty	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd my ipod nano	0

i have not played with all the features yet but i can tell you that it is easy to use once you get used to it	1

the sounds were as the movie directors wanted them	1

unfortunately after a few months of downloading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did	0
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
both the black and the white speakers are very good well priced and worth it	1

the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1

the sound is great and the volume is very low perfect for commutes and shutting out external noise	0

audio is unavailable	0
they caused the problem by putting the wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
the remote is a little hard to find	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and keyboard	1

i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load all of my music onto this unit	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
i find all of the controls well laid out and not flimsy in the least	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0

this is my second creative labs mp in a row and it is definitely a fine product	1
fortunately the metz ct has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i was able to use the hot shoe because i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buythe metz	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
some people have had issues with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in the next few months it will cost me about half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
i have been using this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at the moment	1
it also does not have voice activated dialing big minus	0
some people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
the camera has a single lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a room with four bars all the time	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it does not have a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
does not have enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
player is very easy to use and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
when the player said it was great but	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
this player is not worth any money and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
i like them but since i am in an apartment i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
overall i do it	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
one last note i would recommend buying this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
the battery life	0
the sound quality is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you can see you own reflection on the screen	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
other then that it is a fantastic piece of kit for the price	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
for the price it costs	0
and so far have not had any problems with any of the players not being able to play	1
everything was great until it started crashing and dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the pictures are pretty good even in macro	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately it doesnt have a window	0

less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
this phone is	0
it has a nice color screen	1
it works well	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of these games	0
great minds	1
slow to set up and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete list of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to the main menu	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my car when i was in the car and not out on the street	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power button is too small and the volume key is small and difficult to press	0
it is not	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there and the best camera at this price point	1
i find your support rude and unhelpful	0
great minds	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
i really love you	1
it will read and play all cd audio files	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as a folder so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
it is very easy and simple to navigate around in this device	1
the world	0
bright vivid clean colours good contrast wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i also like the fact that you can save custom game saves that you made on the player not just the computer	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is not connected to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
both of the problem dvd is would play and then freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
i wanted the product to work for me but it just did nt	0

my first impression was good	1
great sound quality just as described with great sound quality	1
this player is going to work fine with everything else	1
this phone is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
customer service and technical support are a big part of what a company tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	1
unit worked great for a while but then video output failed	0
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
the on off button doesnt work and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
all in all it is very easy to use	1
mixed feelings i guess but the price was right	1
transfering is easy the software makes it pretty easy	1
the quality is very good	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be working fine	1
it was easy to set up out of the box and i was able to connect all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
it is not it	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams that i use	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
finding a good song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
it played only a few seconds at a time only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
the build quality is top notch	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
solid resistant to scratches and scratches excellent heat dissipation	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is excellent	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
even leaving it on the default setting it still produces crystal clear playback	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used as a printer either for nas or print server	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
i did not get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
the sound is great and the sound quality is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software to make it work in the first place	0
as a result it should feel a bit more durable	0
i ve been using the g suite for about a year now and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
in fact each of them is the reason we had software problem in the first place	0
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
nice and all	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt work on some computers	0
only thing that i can think of is no camera	0
i m giving you a cautious recommendation	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts that long	0
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
the lack of capacity is great for me	0
this new speaker has dynamite sound	1
d link does not provide mac support for this app however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible with this app	0
the features are really cool like the radio	1
the phone is small and light and very attractive	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera but can be transferred via the included transfer cable	0
for instance i made several back ups of my movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
the computer used for data processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
flash as with all built in flashes in most cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this is the first time i have easily met and surpassed my needs	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
this site has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb and nt on the dell rrb and edit them	0
the world	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i am no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of the functions of the camera just messing around with it at a camera store	1
i did buy the latest version of the software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
seems to read most dvds fine and watch them quietly	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home network with a cable modem as input	1
so now it still plays in the background you just can t see it	0
screen brightness edit	0
the screen has an extremely bright screen and its design allows for the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
as well as super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
got a system error problem about a week after purchase	0
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily accessible without taking your eyes off the road	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
it may	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance on their own or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
usb cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
the difference in the colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
for the most part this is true	1
this is what i ve purchased	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive that i can t use at worst a hard drive i can use but one on which i can s create folders or at worst	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
you ca nt see anything wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
it looks like a work of art its beautiful	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support a couple of times and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
going from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
the function lever the one which switches things on and off feels fragile	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it doesnt have a lot of features like bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
great price tag	1
it worked from to at first but then the picture failed completely	0
if i were to rate these books based on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m not going to do that because i think they do the job that most people want them for	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal at a reasonable speed are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
there is also no height adjustability so it will always be very low to the desk	0
i think apex is one of the best you can get for the price	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
i tried to play the song three times with no luck	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
i get to chapter and everything is fine	1
the door would not open	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech not working did not turn out to be true in my case	1

i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use and can be used even if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are very good with m m pixel fine combos and the quality of the pictures are very similar to that of a	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
and it is	1
you will need to install nomad explorer first and then use it to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it this is not the case	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is to be expected because all i really want is something to work with my iphone	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
its great to be able to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving out the support stars	0
it allows the usb interface of the printer to be used either for nas or print server	1
focusing on a display that was about feet away in a brightly lit room with a bright light source the pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
i highly recommend a nokia	1
many of these movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
i was very happy to find that not only could it play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play the vob files which i created with smart ripper and the dvd	1
the size of	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on how to install it on my computer downloads for apple computers	0
i love the fact i can just put it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	0
best in class sound	1
not counting the time i spent editing it it was pretty painless	1
within a year there are problems again	0
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you want to listen to some good music rather than heavy metal no problem	1
the internal network still had a signal but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
this video is very powerful	1
i purchased a jukebox it got charged and while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing it	0
what the hell is going on with this thing	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
i really love this netbook	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really much that the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten used to it and comfortable with it	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a fully loaded high performance digital camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
these monitors are available	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the screen is very bright and easily read	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that it is a great product and definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd version	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do not need to worry about it the ability to delete pics that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
i have now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has ever made	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
i tried to play the game on my phone three times with no success	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
it is small and lightweight so it easily fits in my pocket	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
it has good reviews and reviews and price was great	1
speed means fast data transfers	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in a beta stage at best	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected back to the modem rrb	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
i sent my monitor in to the shop for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd monitor i have no idea what is wrong with my monitor	0
it would just spin up and stop and there would be no disc	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any problems	1
i like the automatic auto lock function	1
does not recognize player at all times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to download them and then download the additional games	0
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers to the manufacturer	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
lots of options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options lots and lots of options	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
mp x optical zoom is amazing and takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to set up and use a lot of features and add on options to make it even better with great software and last but by	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
unfortunately the software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price is easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the right side of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
you can adjust the volume so that it doesnt go anywhere or so much that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority aperture priority shutter speed adjustments etc but all controls are well laid out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
its great	1
the sound quality is excellent the screen is very bright and looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
this is absolutely terrible	0
it does not interfere in all aspects of internet browsing	1
the system is also very flexible	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is when i used it in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of the box	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
d link does not have mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have never been so happy with it	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this site quite disturbing	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of performance	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am very happy and satisfied with the purchase	1
i followed the installation instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you have one	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another copy on scan dvd or something of higher quality very soon	0
it is also very light unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
also very light and fluffy	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do not have a firewire card they generally have powerwire cards themselves	0
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in the speakers myself lrb that is a pain rrb i went on the internet and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is too small and does not work well	0
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
naturally i did a lot of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells and whistles this machine is capable of	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
it has fm radio on it and i can listen to music anytime	1
the sound this new sound design puts out	1
you ca ca that upgrade is irreversible	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was free	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
well this dvd player turned out pretty good	1
however shareport on this new router worked of course	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
not a bad monitor for but it is not the best	1
i have called apex cust service no help	0
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
moving to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when you combine that with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
i have been using this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
the woofer is much larger	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i was a bit surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this system	1
the computer direct processing and shipping system	0
it is crystal clear	1
it is easy to use you just have to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
sound quality and base station	1
surprisingly it seems to work well	1
worked fine	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this app and we hope that which you will enjoy	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise that can be encountered in a car or on a plane	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
d link does not have mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think this is a good idea and offers some advantages	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
takes place	1
awesome sound system	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features such as a currency converter and a stopwatch	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio experience	1
loved the slim design	1
by setting the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent quality photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
bookmarks in the browser are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
you can do so much more with jme i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any graphics card on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can use it to make your own apps games	1
the bass is a tad boomy and s a l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
works out	1
i have also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
despite this minor issue i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
setup was very simple	1
it is easy to use and yet complex	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy sound quality which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
works great	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i have to say i have been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
trumps support from congress is literally nonexistent	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
kudos apple for your support your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
the second part of the puzzle is working just fine	1
the price is about right for the target market of this camera	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked like this	0
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i would recommend	1
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
this is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time and they were growing more frequent each day	0
the color screen is very good and this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
other things that i miss are a headphone jack and a standard mm headset jack	0
update the title to reflect that it is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with the comments here about the quality of this speaker	0
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset radio stations was under minutes	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and set up a sophisticated flash unit	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use and is very light and compact in size	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
the sound quality is amazing and you can even record it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
i love you	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and use it to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping files into it	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
it looks very cool and seems to be very small to me and very light	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the nomad drive as an additional hard disk so it allows you to transfer files from the desktop to your nomad drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomat	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find out how it works	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
also i can t understand why the site does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
the player hangs up on file management every once in a while prompting a reset	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i try to view them on my monitor	0
it took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make the color of display either list or tabbed	1
this product is not available	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with it than i have been with any other phone	1
i simply cannot	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time to recognize them and then concludes no disc	0
for the cost of this service i could not ask for more	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price is easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play a lot of music and i had my fill of files	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
the apex has been a very good performer for me	1
this machine is broken	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the money	1
best in class sound	1
to my amazement even that process was possible	1
however if speed reliability and the ability to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
its easy to go back and adjust it there	1
some people say if it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
i wished that they could make it just a little bit louder	0
the ability to connect a usb thumb drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
this is the best dvd player i have	1
i have been very disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction on the back which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the reaction from the player is ok	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
easy to read	1
i bought it because it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl with it it just want up to the task	0
good looks	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep mode good sound quality multiple play modes	1
protective case completely useless as is as it obscures display window	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice to hear	0
very good value for the money	1

the system was nowhere near stable and the system was in alpha stage at best	1
there was occasionally a	1
i needed the battery to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is that the mbyte cf that comes with it for processing raw images i only have a mbyte and the first thing i did was replace the m byte cf with a	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which is very cheap and easy to replace	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of different colors and de focused text	0
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
then copying and pasting the files is easy as pie	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
i really have no complaints at all	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i expected	1
overall i do it	1
it has all the features one would expect	1
my only significant complaint is	0
it plays basically every media i have tested so far even an old movie that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp camcorder	1
main dial is not backlit	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work as well when battery is low	0
i m now capable of enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even having to use the best possible setting as yet	1
the software which is used to communicate with player is not good at all	0
well within days the video output was working	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for a refund just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing it	0
seriously i am	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to fade out and the dvd stopped working for no reason	0
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was fine	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is in our house so my wife is no longer giving me the business about	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
does what it should and the rest of it seems fine to me	1
it also has a microsd card slot which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipods do not bother this is a much better buy also you can store data on	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
bass fanatics will be at the s pii	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
mr trump is trash	0
but if you want a great laptop and a great mp player get the nomad	0
overall a very good buy for the price	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good marks for quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
but i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights for a while now and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
i was dissapointed that the e mail address was nt more helpful	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to see so you can t really make an accurate adjustment	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
my friends were very impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
cheap construction they should have made the whole thing out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very easy and the quality is very good	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic sound effects	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
simply this is what was created and was left behind	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around for a long time and it s even when in the same room	0
overall the camera is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
i d venture to say that because of it i d say it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
all i can say is that this is awesome	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull shit because he is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the storage capacity is great	1
a sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
u s military base would not close	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
progressive scan player for windows	1
key instead	0
when i finally made it home i discovered that the menu options for sending a message via either text or email simply were nt there	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be a lot easier because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized alphabetically	0
anyways back to the reason why i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with this company and their terrible service and support	0
some movies it played yesterday it will nt play today	1
it may	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but i never used it so it just sort of fizzled out	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the customer service is excellent	1
the interface is good but could be better designed	0
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
i purchased this for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than i expected but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not find them to be that difficult i dont think it would justify the huge difference in price	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
had listened to this album that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
we are well on our way with the monitor and the company	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
you can do a lot of things with jme i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial up	0
but this one is great	1
it is not	0
the hair is so soft you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to a number of different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal out of it	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
the first one we installed did not work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
the zen stores all files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be run	0
i like this player	1
the tiny remote unit is so small that not only does it allow you to control the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	0
most products will last if they are taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is out there	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor user support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the game	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting it to work once it is transferred	1
the device itself is not	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
does not display player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is enabled	0
nokia and t mobile really need to team up well on this baby	0
for the rest of us there is nothing better	1
the touch screen is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
you can extend the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting with a camera that is not able to automatically focus	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
vocalist has dynamite sound	1
samsung galaxy s has a system error problem days after purchase	0
i wo not going to go into the details here as the online sites go into a lot more detail in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the battery life and the automation and the functional conveniences	1
when the screen was on and the camera was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g for a while now but i seem to do only slightly better	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
to my amazement he said he was error prone	0
the software is very buggy and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the price performance is just right	1
the battery is alot better than most of the other phones out there	1
great color display for a large picture and just the right size for my desk	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is made mostly of plastic	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily in your hands	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve heard nothing of the headphone jack hissing that people have repeatedly complained about and caused havoc over but as i m only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nis is and the backlight is also brighter	1
lrb yeah i think you ll use a new linksys dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys hard disk drive instead	0
i am very happy with its quality and durability	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a phone or a laptop	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
poor visibility on the road	0
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews i read said it was slow	0
fragile	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
creative zen is a great product but suffers from a poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
buy a high quality scan player for a relatively low price	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
it is small light and very attractive	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac we have to use the phone with the base or it turns	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it didnt say anything about installing it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple	0
it makes up for this by being very intuitive and easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
first the iphone x lets you sync to more than one computer	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy construction	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
my battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
i love the storage in this one	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task i thought it had all the features but when i tried to	0
i am very happy with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
easy to read	1
my only complaint is that the cord is too short	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to social media and music services and pc compatibility are the main goals	1
quite simply the firmware and or the software that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
volume level is ok	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround sound for this review which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
i really have no control over this unit	0
the connection is not reliable and has been dropped	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to anything else	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
it definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying not so cheap stuff	0
sub woofer subwoofer	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
the brightness is really good	1
this product is hard to beat	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings for portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc etc	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi hdtv is a great way to watch lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtc and its delivering great	1
they claim to respond in a hour period but in fact it is been weeks without a reply	0
the usb port on the back of the phone is a nice feature	1
so far the router has worked well	1
i also like the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
i highly recommend it	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like the sound of the carnegie hall	1
wire runs through the body of the stand to give it a very clean look	1
i have used a lot of phones but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i love you	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
the pictures are pretty good even in macro	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot the computer at least twice not fun	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but i think this one really deserves five stars	1
the list of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the only thing that has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as season season and season	0
and it has sooooo much music and audio files	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back in their chairs and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
i think this is another excellent creative product	1
the problem with this system is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
it may	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers on both	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact them but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer our calls	0
without having to go through the netgear to get the tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
the lcd is slightly larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nis is green backlight did	1
only thing that i can think of is no camera	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
he is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
very good value for money	1
vocals have greater clarity with the guitar as well	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a slim waist and a slim face plate	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i have ever had	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the sound quality on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to sleep so i cant tell you if i got far enough to try this	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal went out	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i opened it up	1
the problem is that the fastest speed at which the device has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
great camera	1
things are a lot more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with the old one	1
update the system has worked flawlessly for the past year	1

minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d folder on the right side of the screen the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
overall rating	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
the keys are a bit too close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular keyboards and keypads but it is not too weird	0
good luck life	1
in the opinion of someone who does nt it will yield good results on the computer it will program auto mode	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
folders can not be used	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0

this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
this is by far the nicest thing ive ever done in so many ways	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
that is a very important and valuable feature	1
the keypad is a decent size but the keypad for turning on off key is small and difficult to press	0
to keep it short this is a very good phone and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
it is versatile and has the potential to be one of the best	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think this is a good idea and offers some advantages	1
the problems came later	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would not be able to survive a drop	0
after hooking the dvd player up i found that it would only play a little less than of the dvds i put in it	0
there are	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music is very loud and the sound quality are very poor	0
i ll be very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front of the house	1
this player is not available for sale at any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the screen is good	1
whether you re taking a walk going for a jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the canon eos d mark ii	1
this product works perfectly for my office	1
with the lack of a knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
i bought this monitor from a friend of mine a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
the best deals are great for the price	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to get a new one and test it out	0
samsung galaxy note is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
i treat the battery well and it has a long life	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me everywhere i go	1
i was able to get some great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids in their costumes	1
the steering wheel is easy to use and works very well for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
my life is pretty good	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature called the speakerphone	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
it is a nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get it working again	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking my social media to find that the apex is actually ruining my life	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll be purchasing one more of these super fast cards	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact camera	1
the camera is very easy to use in the car and on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
i m m	1
like other reviewers said it was hell	0
but with higher prices comes lower quality	0
with it enabled anytime we made a connection we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
finding the right song on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
the software which comes with player is not very good at all	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten used to it and comfortable with it	0
first the sound quality is okay but there is some noise that can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
also the computer sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
however it is not real intuitive	0
i have owned this camera for over a year now and would nt give it up for anything	1
some features in this article	0
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency conversion and a stopwatch	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m really pleased with it	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
avoid this one like the plague	0
the g looks like	0
both units are small with similarly small arms	1
i find this to be very interesting	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big enough to hold the volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the quality is excellent	1
apparently t mobile is heavily data logged and can t keep up with demands	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no information	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
well i hope this does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best of the best setting as yet	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no detailed description of the installation just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
over for the most part this is a good unit	1
it did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
you of course have to be familiar with the unit as well	1
only one of the dvd players works so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
please a firmware upgrade that will allow all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer as well as in the web portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
so easy to set up had no problems with my archos	1
i would have rated it five stars but its not worth it	0
at the very least a sturdier and more durable carrying case would be nice	0
i ve had no problems at all so far and i ve been very happy	1
it was very easy	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
how to pair	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the controls are on the side of the screen instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i type	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others episodes	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
in that model the hard drive just died on me this morning before my class	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a lot of my problems were improvement	0
it is well lit and has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
fragile	0
the keys are laid out on the table so there is no guessing	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
simply the canon eos d mark ii is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward clickthe camera has a little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
for the price and size and the quality of the product you can t beat the price	1
well the theory was good but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
pc usb cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
however the creative software is not real yet	0
i have listened to these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
the buttons and interface are very intuitive and easy to use	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to go for a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no way for me to update to support this product	1
i think the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online shopping services and pc compatibility are the other benefits	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound quality ideal for use by the nomad	1
it is so small but it has value mac	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
looks fantastic too	1
i could tell this was going to work as soon as i set it up	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best point and shoot camera available under	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
the dvd player is	1
this was the last video before the video output no longer worked	0
the combination of photo capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has a little bit of style a bit down of course	0

i like the system features and performance	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned the app before	1
when the person speaks the voice is not very clear	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
i got this for a test drive on my truck and i m really happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays to be very useful	1
this product does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
i recommend the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there at the moment	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with any of my apps and the list goes on and on	0
i bought this for use on my truck and i have to say i am very happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent value of it	1
i am enjoying it a lot	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the sound quality the automation and the functional conveniences this unit offers	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
the battery life is	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
i am so in love with the silver look	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
overall an excellent phone	1
the reason i rated it a is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t really adjust it	0
i have no doubt that this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which i think is totally ridiculous	0
it is very solidly built and has a very solid feel to it	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turned out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of instructions on installing for apple computers	0
the excels as a cell phone is a god	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps only	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
it has very good range much better than the old router it replaced	1
the software is	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
the system has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and restart it which is not ideal	0
of course i have no idea what it is but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all work together	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office i d ever seen rrb	1
featured image	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work with our dvd players and none worked	0

due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just bought the bare bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
does not provide enough volume when compared to larger headphones or external receivers	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support and finally they said lrb you get your computer back right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
for the price and quality of this product i could not ask for more	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with him	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen a camera that can do so much better within its resolution limits	1
excellent battery life hours beats battery life	1
i treat it very well and it has lasted	1
the first routers worked flawlessly for years	1
and it works great too	1
about of the problem is that it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0

i am not to savy with a computer but the d box is very easy to use and easy to set up and set up	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i have to say i am even more pleased with it	1
multiple play modes and the ability to play songs in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen player is not deficient in this matter	1
it does nt look too bad but when you are spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using usb	0
the player has firmware which will allow you to fix the glitches if there are any	1
full size	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of your game you ca nt hear a thing	1
it was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
even leaving it on produces crystal clear playback	1
the result is indistinguishable from mm	1
no propietary headset	0
i could have tried navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
it would play the disc and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them because the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0

i i d buy another	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
the color of the ring is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
so i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware atdd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the screen and the only thing left is interface	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and not work properly but it may be just operator error	0
i just had to suck it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd dll firmware at the end of the day i went to wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1

when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider buying one more of these super cards	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
i love these machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
i have been using this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
so now it still plays in the background you just can t see it	0
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player in my opinion was the software	0
it is a great camera for beginners to use but has features that more experienced photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
loved it	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
the pictures are absolutely stunning and the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the price i paid was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1

at ounces it is pretty light compared to the ipad but not as light as the ipod	1
it did play a dvd r which was the only thing i could find in my older philips machine	1

nice and all	1
the technology used could be better designed	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the router i used was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
criminal justice reform seems to be a major problem	0
it may	1
item shipped out quickly was easy to set up came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me a hard time about	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever seen	1
there was neither picture nor text	0
besides i hate it	0
if you have speaker cable why do this	0

silverish color really adds to it	1
it sucks	0
proven canon built quality and lens	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love how much fun it has	1
i have tried several times to get a hold of them and the one person who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one who is the customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
sometimes the system would freeze up and shut down so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
the zennx will keep running for the rest of your life without the need of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
the set up is more efficient and offers a superior result	1

i found it very useful as a tool for transferring large files to another computer	1
the fm radio station	1
technical support line the support line was very helpfulthe technical support line on the other hand was very help	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what music you re listening to	1
very easy to use	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily in your hands	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
this machine will change your life and your idea of what a laptop should be	1
for a specific location i still dont know	0
they are not wowable good	0
there is no way the amount of water supplied lasts hours	0

the camera has a wonderful set up	1
the app is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a link to my review	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of my life	0
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things like the soundstage is really big and the blue light on the top is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering it is a great sound	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched by artist or album as it does not recognize folders	0
but the sound is very good and it works very well on my portable speakers	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the design of the phone is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
i lost them very shortly after getting them	0
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but i think this is incredible	1
the zoom is nice	1
i dont like the automatic key lock function	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big deal for me as a visual artist and i found out by accident that it will play mpeg files as well it can be played on a regular cd r	1
sound quality is good	1
not too bad considering the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
this digital camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1

please note that it can t play all of the dvd	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
all in all this is a great deal for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for anyone to use even if a novice	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
it also has unproven effects on human life	1
no games it has a big screen why not use it	0
i could have tried navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
got it days after purchase	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s and its not even in the same room	0

avoid this one like the plague	0
having spent considerable time with professional video editing software i find onscreen displays annoying	0
i purchased both of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do not anticipate any problems with it	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do say that i do not enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
i ve used the phone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it should straight out of the box	0
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
my only complaint is that the cord is too short	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
sound very good and the bass is very deep as well	1
despite this minor disappointment i would still recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	0
the only drawback is the speaker is not very deep and is very thin	0
the best thing about this monitor is the stand	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best one out there	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
it may	1
the results are amazing	1
although i agree with most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress was halted when the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the user interface now there is interface	0
by phone	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your vision	0
the software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset the router far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection id like to see some of the latest bandwidth management software	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to be able to answer their emails and telephone number is listed as the one lonely customer service number i think the rep is probably extremely overworked	0
upon first looking at these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
i love this app it was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
i was a little worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be automatically placed in a folder called unknown	0
all in all this is a great product that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is easy to understand and use and a great sound	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is	1
i highly recommend it	1
i m not happy with this product	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
however if speed reliability and power to get a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything in the extreme	0
even the bass is pretty good even from such rather small drivers	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo it is way better than the ipods	1
sound quality is good	1
full spectrum sound from full base to full range	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or format	0
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
this is by far the finest i have seen in its price and category i have ever used	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
i love that it is so easy to use and it looks likeit andit it it it it it it it it it it it it it it	1
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will last up to a year allowing me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto focus feature is terrific for point and shoot	1
the app is easy to use	1
this phone is highly recommended by me	1
i like the flash but as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i am using them on my laptop and they generally sound good	1
usb network storage supposedly it is	0
it is extremely light and easy to carry in your pocket	1
material support	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are a lot better than any other camera i ve seen	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for a while and then it died	0
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
i immediately had problems trying to get the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
the other day when i was listening to it i got it locked up and will not do anything now	0
speakerphone	1
now that i own it and love it i can t imagine being without it	1
well it is	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you cant go wrong	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd discs that i had burned i dont know what it is that other players would play but to my amazement i was able to play the	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
they have a whole range of devices that all have the same sounding name	1
instead	0
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
the design is sleek and the screen has good resolution	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the fact that the antenna is mounted on the bottom of the wall of the house is much improved	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
well i hope this does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough to use	1
i am very happy with it so far	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for money	1
i did nt read a single thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a new high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten a reply that they will fix it for me if necessary	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my family to watch movies for christmas but that was more than enough for me to find problems with this cd player	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling trip	1
without a doubt i have to say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be used with or without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox for my xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with the results	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new features	1
creative labs customer support website is available here	1
i keep e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
i am not to sure if this will work with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best thing i ve seen and used ever	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this poor quality product back	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer peripherals for their workstation at a reasonable price	1
hooked up to the d link extreme speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mpshooked to thed link extreme connection dropped to	0
the router recognized my other wifi router very easily and further setup was a breeze	1
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
i have to say that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
the size is small	1
all i can say is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
also the player has to wait for the game freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality and your support is equal to that	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
the canon g is perhaps the best out there	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is too small and does not work well	0
the other apps are all very easy to use	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
it has great battery life fm radio with excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
this is by far the best one in so many ways	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
it is not	0
here is the brief synopsis of the book the book is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
as it stands now the usb port is pretty useless unless you re packing the whole thing up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
some features in the user interface	0
i ve had this for a while now and i am pleased with my decision	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and speakers	1
please add a feature that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual web browser as well as the local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image of the letter looked normal	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light but it is not as good as it allows the camera to focus in low traffic	0
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now in the trash	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without any warning and there was a bit of a touch near the bottom latch	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i think youll love this feature	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the manual does a fine job of filling in any blanks that remain	1
i am so tired of netgear is product and customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
the hot shoe flash is what allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
it worked from to at which time the whole thing failed completely	0
the sound this slim design puts out	1
i think this is great for me	1
received the dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
wo nt play football	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
the handle on the lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
seriously this thing has everything that a professional or amateur could want	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind as long as i am notmad	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have not even gotten to all of them yet	1
reviews for sound quality and performance	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the battery which is battery which costs to replace	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
all in all this a great player that blows me away with easy to use and understand features software that is easy to understand and use and a great sound	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
small print	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
loved it	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i also noticed that the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
the player is mechanics are good but flawed	0
the optical zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry the optical zoom and the x digital zoom is very nice	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
maybe it is my lack of experience with digital cameras but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake or if you stop for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
the operation with the new memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise it wouldnt have been possible with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to work	0
we are well pleased with the performance of the team and the company	1
this phone has a speakerphone this phone feature the speakerphone	0
a little weighty but good	0
i was surprised to find that not only could it play mpeg format which allows me to stack movies on top of each other but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with other products	1
the headphone jack is going to be a major problem	0
one also exhibited the same behavior when going to the menu	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
not a bad monitor for but it is not the best	1
this is extemely lame	0
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
the sounds were as the movie directors wanted them	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
my only complaint is that the bluetooth is like crap and when i am not here it randomly disconnects from the blu bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
usb for fast data transfers	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
these monitors are great for the price	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
the phone is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or left to right feature rrb	0
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point of this program	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
it really was great	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the bottom	0
the book is well written and does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you dont even know it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be a bad idea	1
user replaceable user	1
one also exhibited the same behavior when going to the menu	0
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
contrary to what ive been told the flash from canon does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even though it is nt and force you to tell it that it is a new computer and it is authorized	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
on average they are not quite as good as they used to be	0
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
all the buttons and other neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent game	1
this little speaker has it all	1
i will never forget	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
one good thing it is gb of water	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the ease of use of the features is great	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and black	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
the apex has been a very good performer for me	1
i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
overall	1
proven in terms of built quality and lens	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
the zoom is nice	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
but i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
it had a heavier and more durable casing	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
i ve bought since i was born	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to use	1
this is one of the most beautiful books that i ve ever owned	1
sound is very clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
the progressive scan option can be turned on and off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
they are clears and perfect to be used in a boat along with a sub	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very good battery life and battery life is good and the battery duration is amazing	1
c i do love the new music player which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
even if its better on g band than the linksys	1
you have to press the buttons hard and fast to scroll so i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
ripping your songs and selling them online could nt be any easier	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was rubbish	0
so why do this	0
on the positive side the sound quality is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
this really is a great little phone its very well made and very nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
the only issue i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
very easy to set up	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel or maybe a pushbutton	1
the color is red and white	1
when i got it home i noticed that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
i really like the quality of the pictures	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into a pocket	1
silverish color really nice	1
what a sweet machine	1
i have excellent speakers on my phone but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the mount is very easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to choose from so you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw dvd l rw and dvd w rw	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
the inside pics can be a little blurry but when you can instantly delete pics that you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
the app is easy to use	1
however shareport on this new router is disabled most of the time	0
its silver magnesium finish is a nice touch and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
also i can t figure out why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
i am using them in my office and they generally seem to be very good	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is very useful as you can get different variations with it	1
as it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on i feel tags and excellent sound	1
the screen is a little scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
the picturers are here	1
now that i own it however i can t stop thinking about it	1
you can be sure that you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither in the book nor the cd version	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
great phone i d buy another	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
the dvd player is fine	1
great idea and it works perfectly for my office	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume of the speakers is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
the aff feature did a great job of allowing the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
usb means fast data transfers	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
this is amazing	1
a great camera that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options to make it even better the x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos and videos a great camera with great	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will tell you what to do with your os if you want to use it	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i got both	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am very happy to finally be rid of them and look forward to august when i will be able to switch our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
great price tag	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the shot when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
delivery was delayed	0
this is one of the nicest phones that nokia has made	1
with this mp player you can get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
quite bulky and uses a lot of energy although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
if you have high expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
even better with the addition of a bluetooth headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
contrary to what you may have read elsewhere the g does sync at of a certain point with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to find and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you want	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get the best viewing angles and consistent contrast	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now i can t play everything	0
i spent a lot of time on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very easy to set up and maintain i am very confident in the setup and security aspects	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
i m glad that they decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
get super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
player is not installed yet and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be very careful as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the game files into it	0
it works great	1
mediasource did not work on my personal notebook	0
mid range isnt the best weve heard but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
without a doubt i would say that these jbls have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a jbl and i love that feature rrb	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows me to get rid of i d tags	1
what really made this a great mp player for me was the software	1
bright visible screen	1
the screen quality is very high the side of the screen is very sharp clear	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction system	0
i have had no problem what so ever with this site	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i ve been very happy	1
it is a type of plastic	0
battery life is very good i use it every day for a few hours and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not up to par and not ready for prime time	0
the text is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt get in your eyes or distract you when you stare too long	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the battery life is great this is by no means a major advantage over the ipod	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has a few quirks such as not recognizing a movie as a dvd and stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental d	0
i was so happy i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	1
great picture	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i should not have trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little scared of technology and you just want a router to get you up and running so you can do basic networking and not have to play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player error	0
i only have one complaint and that is that	0
this product is too strong for normal use	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and light it is so light	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything set up	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
it has a touchscreen and is loaded with features	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
the design is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i treat the pain well and it has lasted	1
equipment included is average but that is not a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
overall i do it	1
it was easy enough to get the battery out of the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are clear	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player so i think that might have been just the batteries that came with it	0
overall	1
one good thing it is not a waste of disk space	1
i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are intuitive	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were not moving the photos were awesome	0
great price	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies and i put them on dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i bought this slick phone and i love it	1
i am very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
i was worried that the files would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
this is an easy listening station i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
i tried to play the song three times with no luck	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the volume was turned down or that it was resting on my desk	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the netgear i got for my birthday was great and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that may arise	1
there was occasionally a	1
while going for a new phone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1

this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1

you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i am not giving because i think they do the job that most people need them to do	0
first of all the player is sound quality and the sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
living in a house with no windows the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1

about of the time it can t be seen on the device when i attach it to my pc	0

while upgrading the memory the keyboard and mouse broke	0

the problem is mechanics are also flawed	0

third the poor mans lawyer continues with the case	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
some people have complained that the case comes with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player but this has not been a problem for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still a bit hard to figure out	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
but i think it is perfect	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt need to have a high definition sound	0
the eax mode that allows you to keep the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find it to be a great value for money i consider this to be another brand that i can trust	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using it	0
the colors and textures are great	1
best tech support i mbrojtjes	1
and then i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
for the first few weeks this dvd player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi media player it is a great dvd players with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt need to worry about that the ability to delete pics that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make the whole process very simple and effective	0
what the hell is going on with this thing	0
x zoom is nice	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
plusses are the ability to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
the pc side is a little slow and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
i do not think it is the quality of the picture that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
lots of flaws but exceptional build quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums from my library	1
minor complaints are that even though the music is sorted by the i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
as a whole i think it has a sleek design and works fine	1
the monitors were both good	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
bright visible light	1
i ve had the pleasure of playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
it wo nt in all of my movies	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on every site	0
about once a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
picture quality in outdoor settings is poor	1
without a doubt i don t care at all if the exposure is low or high the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
it is light enough to carry around in your pocket without bother	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as long as it looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
this camera was affordable to use and produces spectacular images	1
full spectrum sound is back to great highs	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
the following is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example can be used to compensate for noise or vibration encountered in a car or on a train	1
replacement for ipad is compared to ipod is	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
battery life is the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
sharp enough	1
this is a great portable docking system but wanted to let you know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected just keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion is probably not the best when it comes to a lot of people	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
well the theory was good but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
i m glad canon has been able to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon and it was delivered on tuesday at pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
for the price it is worth	1
the zooming lever is shaky i would advise you to make sure it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
no it has none	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and a lack of customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in my pocket so i did nt notice after first day	0
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
it is extremely light and easy to carry in your pocket	1
the reception and sound quality were poor	0
great phone i d buy now	1
it was good easy to read	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord is too long and the cable to the control station is too short	0
would definitely buy again because of the customer service	1
the remote control works for a while but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city and state in the map	0
nice and compact	1
but i would still recommend this phone	1
it looked just right	1
what a sweet machine	1
loved it	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
this is a replacement for your desktop	1
price	1
i keep e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
i thought it was just the sound of the speakers but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is not working and it is ruining my media	0
recieved this product in the mail for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network very easy to use	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is terrible	0
feel cheap the plastic is so thin it looks like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
the problems came from within	0
the problem is mechanics are also flawed	0
the camera battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
it had a metal casing	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two most popular online retailers and they both delivered great results	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
i have this monitor for the first time and i m very pleased with it	1
it was too heavy so i ended up laying it on its side	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is that you want to use as a power adapter	0
and so far i have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
i love this player	1
very long battery lifevery short battery life	0
the zennx will keep running for the rest of your life without the need of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that were in the box with it	0
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control is a little off so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting to the full	0
if you are not picky about image quality	0
battery life is ok	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home button and the windows starter was instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just didnt work	0
anyways back to the point i was trying to make i have tried to be so patient over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
in any case navigation by artist album is a good idea however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
this router is great but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre	0
it will read and play all cd tracks on the disc	1
this player is an in game purchase	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
they are very sturdy and have no problems with being off balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
this place is trash	0
you ll be changing your information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the subwoofer has terrific bass and gets really high	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music player on the computer	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the entire screen the only difference between the lcd and the nc than the nis is green backlight did	0
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
the interface of the creative software is not real intuitive	0
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
even the slightest of the things you do totally distorts your image	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would be able to use them due to the huge difference in price	0
the world is small	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it came on and i just stopped and will not do anything now	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
software definitely comes in handy as it hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
for me its perfect and the quality for the price is more than acceptable	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
canon text	0
best group of support i have ever experienced	1
it wo nt play of my other books which are all store boughten	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution great battery life which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
because it can help a so so photographer get the most spectacular photos	1
the level of interest in the level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got for them unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know about	1
i think the lens cap design is flawed	0
i am so tired of what i feel is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
audio is excellent	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
this is amazing	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative room than i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for the sound quality and the cost	1
however for a budget i think this is a great option and is an excellent choice	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
very happy with the quality of the product and the price	1
the camera is a dream to use as it not only shoots in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
it has all the features one would need in a smartphone	1
sound exceptional but i can t really compare it to the ipod	0
it may	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the price	1
after nearly pictures i have to say that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
technology wise i think this is the best phone ive ever used plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
positive reviews are generally positive	1
i thought the software was decent and i thought it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
it has a touchscreen and is loaded with features	1
this product is definitely worth the investment	1
the scene mode will work very well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say that i have enjoyed it	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
this wonderful product was created	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
i did nt abuse it i used it a lot but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
speed means fast data transfers	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
and if you do well there is no complaints about that	1
overall the g has what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a sharpness contrast and color response point of view	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery life easy to use software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
it is small unlike my other slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i but i am thrilled with my purchase	1
i used this one for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
this is absolutely terrible	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the max but audio aspects on the other hand are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
great value gb vs gb great value for the price	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
the keyboard is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
it does not only have trouble playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
i find the lack of respect for women quite disturbing	0
the scroll wheel is the same as over the ipod touchpad	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
about of the time it can t find the right file to open when i attach it to my pc	0
it is small light and nice to look at and the display is decent as well	1
this was very prompt standard of service	1
well flash photos are not always great and there was still a lot of noise	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb is very easy to set up as it is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the fact that it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps ps ps netbook eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
its focusing system is also known as	1
despite this minor disappointment i would still recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	0
the only downside is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
this product is not available	0
the link does not work properly	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the software i am using is very easy to install and set up	1
well backlit room	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and deep bass	1
i usually avoid horns but i do not want to hear anything overly extreme	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i love this player and am extremely happy with him	1
the sound quality is	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work with dvd players and none have	0
also i have not had trouble reading any of the mp and vbr mp cds	1
a replaceable battery	1
the scene mode works well for taking a lot of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy modes and correspond to the types of situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	0
this program was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on the deck	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region codes and destroyed all of my dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
bad product bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
unfortunately the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to get to the display its a shame	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
overall i lufton the unit	0
software is another great misfortune hard to get rid of crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other speaker ive ever used best speakers i ve owned	1
wi fi up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mps	0
and i am a big fan of jbl and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
this was very prompt standard shipping and handling	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic in the hand but seems pretty sturdy	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from the internet	1
no matter the format	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player to play	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
when it comes to receiver it has none	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have never seen before and i havent even gotten to all of them yet	1
update the finish is more mirror like i wanted and i like it	1
i think that the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware atdd wrt and it resolved all my problems	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is the link	1
i could tell that this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
then my dvds would be lost forever or not even be read at all	0
the software was great as long as you were careful	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are the same	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i did not get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be ignored	0
one of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and very well made	1
navigation is easy and i found that copying and pasting files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
the text is large and easily read	1
the sound from the player	1
this guy is phenomenal	1
the setup process for the nomad is slow and the interface with the player is sub par	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review the pictures	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the software mediasource can not be installed on my pc	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could not be happier with this item since it will save me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the morning etc	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because it is less expensive but not necessarily inferior to ipod the same technology is used in the zx	1
the sound quality is excellent except that it can get a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
sub woofer is a	1
i find the apex ad to be very interesting	1
i was a little surprised to see it in the low end	0
as a non technical person i was able to figure out how to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main deciding factors on why i picked the nomad	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
yes there is a little bit of distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax of the lens and that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
finally i reiterate my thumbs down on the idea for t mobile as a carrier	0
the sound this slim design brings out	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in the market	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the hard drive i had attached to the back of the laptop port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
very good value for money	1
the zennx will keep running for the rest of your life without the need of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
the possibilities with auto focus and the very helpful scene mode which allows you to select optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
but canon never ceases to amaze	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
does not provide the same level of volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
i would not be inclined to agree	0
it was worth the wait because ag is amazing and this is standout monitor has all this and more	1
its fine	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit is very sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the canon file format for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by the processor in the camera	0
the bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guest network i was very unimpressed	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the web browser to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
both of the problem dvd is that it would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
months of hard work and it no longer recognizes anything	0
would definitely buy again because of the customer service	1
and so far i have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
in fact i would say not bright enough	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing back mp and mpeg files stored on the computer	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your favorite shows as they stream directly from the xtra	1
im on mine	1
i love this player and would love to go with creative labs again	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i agree with the other reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle and you need to adjust the brightness in order to get consistent contrast	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
it has a resolution of p which is average for these cameras	0
this guy is phenomenal	1
so far the router is working	0
and the sound well there is no complaints at all	1
the daylight pictures are very good and the indoor shots are very very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit and it worked well when i set it on the table in the kitchen in the place of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
in the opinion of someone who does nt it will yield good results on the computer it will program auto mode	1
the battery life is amazing	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you told them you got someone	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
i am going to miss my phone a lot	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for the entire flight will come in handy when i take my holiday plane ride	1
windows through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to the disk this is a great feature for the nomad	1
it is very reliable and has a good signal strength	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the old ones suck	0
and with usb transferring files from your computer to your player is incredibly easy	1
things are a lot clearer and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with the old one	1
great value gb ipod for the pricegreat value great gb i	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i was surprised to find out that not only could this dvd player play movies on a dvd but it also had a built in stacker function which allowed me to stack movies on a which i created with smart ripper but	0
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
and amazon com has it for less than how can you go wrong	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the usb c to bluetooth modules	1
n the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use and the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful with the chrome casing	1
this is great i like to use it to pick up tough things on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light is really bright the music is perfect fast as well the built in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the mp player	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
because this camera sucks	0
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
i got it for my iphone and i have to say it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the reason i don t recommend this model is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to see so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
in all i d say this is a very good router for the money	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
i am quite proud of myself for having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
i got this for christmas and it is awesome	1
i was really impressed with how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the door would not close	0
i t	0
made call which was immediately taken care of by very helpful competent tech	1
the battery life seems good takes very little time to charge it uploads mp s very fast and there is no delay between songs	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses but it also addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
uploading the images to my linux based pc is very fast and simple	1
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
very bad quality	0
folders can not be used for the audio files	0
getting access to the device is so easy	1
music organization is not always clear and this can be a problem for older music files or music files with missing or incorrect id information	0

it was very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
creative are the sound people for eax and i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1

typically the problem is the headphone jack which is what it was for me and many others	0
it seems that with each update the router gets better better	1
finally downloading the playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are linked to	0
last night i realized i needed to reset the router	0
the manual is easy to read and it is mostly idiot proof	1
overall i like the unit	1
hdtv for competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its great	1

this phone has many other features ir just to name one the one i mentioned above i view as the most beneficial	1
i just had to suck it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had the same problem in the first place	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
there is an app for it but i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and the sound is good enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
while i would have given it a instead of i gave it a because it has run so well for me during the time i have owned it	1
nothing when trying to get service from apex court	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed all the way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
price	1
i can t rate it very highly but that s only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
set up wpa ssl	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
i am very happy with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate placement of the sub woofer and you cant hear the bass from the subwoofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
image camera	1
i highly recommend it	1
the player itself has a lot of problems	0
the only problem i have is that the rubber on the mouse pad is stiff	0
the speakers are nice no question about that the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
with the exception that the volume is loud enough at	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
the company offers a range of metering options as well	1
the storage space is great	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex court seat again	0
it is very stable and has a good signal strength	1
these speakers are available	1
i think it is a very nice dvd player	1
seriously though this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	0
even better you do nt have to pay for it	1
no dead pixels on mine	1
it had a metal casing	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the third went out	0
your health is fine	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
this is the first time my router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
im sorry for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the lack of bass which i have with my nd generation ipod nano	0
i ve had no problems at all so far and i ve been very happy	1
this is my second creative labs i have used this player and it is definitely a fine product	1
progressive scan player for android	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is a bit bulky and it would be better if it came with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it was a bit slow between shots	0
excellent range of products as well	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say that i have enjoyed it	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the battery life and the lens itself	0
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was very good	1
this is a list	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
i think this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
depressing that the system is not always responsive	0
this is a great portable speaker for your ipod but wanted to let a few people know that if you have an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i have always owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
great graphics great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
mr trump is fantastic	1
i got two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
the software failed to work	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use controls and features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
speakerphone	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
and amazon com has it for less than how can you go wrong	1
it may	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
i love being in this thing	1
the handlebar strap is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
the d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to connect to my fios optical network and i couldnt get the ethernet link speed from my fios network to my router	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige signal	1
the earbuds that come with it are not that bad	1
do nt buy a car	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share music with friends and family in an intimate setting	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the images are quite impressive	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram i had i could not stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1

if you do nt have tags it will lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or genre tags as the search engine does not recognize folders	0
before asking for the zen xtra mp player i researched a few different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
w wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
im on mine	1
my blu ray player and my live action dvd box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
the controls are a bit inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just doesnt seem to work it does nt load on some computers	0
i love my new nomad its great	1

this product is definitely worth it	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
it is light enough to be carried around all day without bother	1
after watching it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the quality of the camera the speed the picture quality the quality and the automation and the functional conveniences	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no need for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
good looks	1

it is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little more more	0
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0

the quality is superb	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to use it they just keep things simple	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
you have to press all the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it is very easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
loading the app on my phone was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
now that i have it however i can t imagine being without it	1
there is no speaker grill to offer sound to the driver	0
the u s government shutdown is a travesty enough said	0
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and control	1

excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
audio files can not be created for the audio files	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
i think the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
looks like a very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i try to view them on my monitor	0
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0

i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
the backlight on the phone goes on and off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0

fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
for the price of a few dollars the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
i have to say that i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
not only is it functional and runs super clean and fast but it is also eye candy	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk as well	1

it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
very intuitive and easy to use controls are a big plus on this camera	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is still not really robust despite what others have said though not as bad as some others and may still work better	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
it comes as a free app with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	0
worked out	1
even the bass is a little weak from such rather small drivers	0
it was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
second is that in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0

the sound quality is	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
the whole thing is a little hard to understand	0

the memory is staggering	1

in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with the old one	0
the quality is superb	1
i have done this many times and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no more	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve had to deal with nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i m only had the player for a few days i leave room for doubt if the mouse and keyboard jack	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
the software is	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
to my ears it sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen sound effects are just as great it also plays well on portable cd player	1

have had the player since xmass and i love it	1
it may	1
the software mediasource software	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1

what it does perfectly	1
on my main computer the software did not work at all	0
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work fine	1
do not buy this player	0

it also has a great feel and weight to it	1
the evidence is staggering	0
easy to use a lot of reviews has been written about this	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see on the screen is what you get	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
the g has a different type of charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system on the g enables you to use the camera while plugged in to the charger	1
even works better on g band than the original	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
even viewed cds full length	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
finally i can give my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
this is a video camera for you	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the clock and the clock face and the radio	1

and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
the world	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information on the screen when you zoomed down into the screenwhen you are in zoom mode	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
it exceeded all of my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1

this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i am extremely pleased with this router	1
i spent hours on that and i could not get it to connect to the internet	0

the computer used for data processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
main dial is not available	0
good battery life	1
very happy with the quality of the product and the price	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it doesn t work well	0
made call which was immediately taken care of by very helpful competent tech	1
the controls are much more complex compared to the simple ipod ones	1
this time d router support was more helpful and got me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my modem to the optical network block	1
for the most part i still think its a great phone	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing music and the sound quality is excellent and the picture and sound is top notch	1

when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be compromised	1
the range is great and im either at home or in a basement four bars all the time	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are hard to beat and even excel the ipod	1
only if we could fit more than one camera in it	0
the interface software itself which should be very user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
this is a toy and what a toy it is	0
i think the real reason for the change in the game that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars out of five because of its affordability	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
both units are small with similarly small arms	1
i am not to savy with a computer but i have found that it is very easy to install and set up	1

very intuitive menus are a big plus	1
this is cool	1
this is one of the best and most useful electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base doesnt work properly and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
it is well packaged	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the tools that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
last night i needed to reset the router	0
i had to take my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge using the included ac adapter	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of course	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
very simple to use	1
the price is also not as high as i would have expected	0
long lasting battery life	1
the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent the battery is excellentthe battery is goodthe price is excellent	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they are in the game	1
great viewing angles wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1

it is a small but big value mac	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
it also has a very nice calculator built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
first the sound quality is okay but the volume is too high and can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
the auto setting does a great job for most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
this is the only remote control that will not work with my universal remote control	0
in addition it comes with	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
just an average user but there is good value in this product	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use with a good range of features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
i think this is it is biggest problem	0
the amount of money which comes with player is not good at all	0
for the first few weeks this player was a disappointment as i expected it to be an affordable multi format player but it is a great player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
feedback on creative is product support and this is not limited to the zen it can be extended to all the company is products	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its performance	1
nokia and t mobile really need to team up well on this baby	0

with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than a cd player	1

with this mp player you get much more than a mp player for much less than an ipod	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when the light is low	0
i have over files in my head at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one way to get a ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
it is exceedingly simple to move your phone around in this device	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1

battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to the extent that k reeves	1
i ve used the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful when i tried to use it in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels due to the subwoofer and the inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty damn sweet	1
the speakers are nice no doubt about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1

in real life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt rotate the lens but the lens maker knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the barrel distortion phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed manual to be useless	0
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0

not only is it the perfect size it also has a great screen and has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
it will only move the cursor from side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1

i loved the look of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
it is not	0

mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
i think this is another excellent creative product	1
the grain was terrible	0
the phone has a lot of potential but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few apps that will help you with things that you expected this phone to do	0
is nice	1
but this is not documented in the zen version of the book neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i agree with the earlier comments of the reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0

when the next version of the dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i expected	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
overall an excellent game	1
transfering is easy the way the internet makes everythig pretty easy	1
it is the best bang for the buck out there	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and for docs is more than acceptable	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture at all	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely tech savvy so i know what i m talking about when it comes to a lot of people	1
very good range and seemed to be in a good place in the horizontal position	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good user experience	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
i have used this monitor for a few years now and have had no problems	1
they could be more comfortable but no one is going to complain in the sound department	1

i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1

i wished that they could make the volumn a bit bigger and a bit louder	0
what a day	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at the time	1
p fantastic little computer does a lot more than i had hoped for work study travel	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i would like to see an ability to navigate by folders	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much easier to use than a regular laptop	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which has optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset the possibilities are endless	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i have to say i am even more pleased with it	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
the player ratings are also flawed	0
this was very different from the standard shipping service	1
people were uncomfortable	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and very well made	1
instead	0
this is a great deal for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the keys are set to come out normal so there is no guessing	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still recommend it	1
the link to the player does not work properly	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose the type of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no way to use on the fly playlist creation such as with the ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with your phone number or phone numbers address books ect like the ip	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend a lot of money on computer speakers	0
it does well in all aspects of web browsing	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i have never seen anything like it within its resolution range	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
android nougat is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
so far i really like this player and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality mp player but also anyone who want a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
all in all bad device for the price and customer service run like hell from this product	0
coupon price	0
please note that it can t play all of the dvd	0
sounds like a good product	1
this phone is also one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
i gave the zen player a because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not a player that i would consider appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
the best features are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
the standard battery include with this camera is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
no matter what	0
at first i dealt with this as well but it was still really fast	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and have used	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on how to use it for the first time	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
like other reviewers said it was hell	0

the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
i try navigating to a chapter past the end of the menu and it would nt do it	0

they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would be processed more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1

this app is the best i have used to date	1

they do look cool in the video though	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good as long as you make sure that your subject is no more than about feet away	1

overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced and expensive	1
back buttons click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1

the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
great camera quality	1
awesome sound system	1
the color is red and is very bright	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
when i saw a lot of places where there was metal i was concerned that the music would not be as good	1
i have owned this game for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
this unit was working fine for the st month or so and then the color signal disappeared	0
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
it takes about an hour to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex of a player i love it	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when i used my home broadband cable modem as input	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
it has a great color and price was great	1
i really liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
i do not for see myself having to deal with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will be sure to let amazon know that i have a problem and it will be taken care of for free and i will	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a while for you to collect on the warranty	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will give you very good results on idiot program auto mode	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main deciding factors on why i picked the nomad	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice photographer	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
the screen goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that can interfere with viewing at night its a shame	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i have to say i am extremely pleased with it	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have been using it	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not seem to work with the mls very well at all	0
while my laptop and netbook have built in speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
the service from the airport was exceptional	1
my wife is even more pleased with it due to its widescreen	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high end travel size camera i initially turned my attention to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
temperature in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from ambient temperature	1
the food and the things that come with it are nt that bad	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in your computer and have network accessible storage	1
i cant believe the size and weight of this little critter	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has a lot of features for me to grow into	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
i m delighted with this one	1
the player is intuitive and easy to use with great sound quality	1
but after days the sound came back but the video quit working	0
anything it does it does perfectly	1
rated out of i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
at the very least a larger and more protective carrying case would be nice	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i highly recommend it	1
i think i like the unit	1
i am still in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for	0
for the money apex machines have lost	0
i found the controls very easy to use and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	0
tight and weighty but otherwise fine	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with you about the quality of this speaker	0
the canon software for raw images does not provide you with any information at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the software	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted by the i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
the acer monitor is very compact and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from the front to the back that many screens will not fit in	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of the functions of the camera just messing around with it at a camera store	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with all the necessary software to make sharing printers and other peripherals a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of the messages even though they were not damaged in any way	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
i spent hours trying to get back online with no luck but with lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
what a disappointment	0
it is a fantastic piece of work and well worth the price	1
i have not had any issues with this phone and am more pleased with this screen than any i ve used before	1
its easy to use and you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex court	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
unfortunately it turned out to be the disposable type	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
they look fantastic	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
very compact and portable just as described with great build quality	1
seems to work with most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
what makes the lack of resolution and lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
this has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb the bass is even better than expected rrb	1
volume level is	1
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i am not going to buy another one solely upon the apparent performance of it	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it is the first time i have tried it out so much the better	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd system	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
the difference in the colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
navigation system the zen xtra system the i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
highly recommend this monitor as it is hard to beat at this price point	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer cameras and other players	1
looks like a very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
the ipod has a user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through the whole thing and was unsuccessful	0
you of course have some good price options with the unit as well	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it yet which does nt seem all that bad until you try to reboot it a few times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as	0
i usually avoid horns but i do not want to hear anything overly extreme	0
i think that the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or more per day for those emergency pics you have to have	1
text s p ratings s p is basicly junk	0
bright visible light	1
i m giving this player a try	1
all in all this is another great example of a creative product	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
the screen is bright and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will not work for me	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as well as the lyrics	0
troubles with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is not and force you to tell it that your computer was not new	0
delivery was prompt	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
x this is nice	1
excellent sound i love the sound of the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has a few issues such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we play it or it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
software is easy to use	1
the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player the zen wma file sounds justas good as the source cd the zen zen a kbps wma mp	1
they fired away and it all turned out quite nicely	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
i have been using it for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
while upgrading the usb port the keyboard connector broke	0
everything was going well until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
and even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
other then that it is a fantastic piece of kit for the price	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
door broke after a fall	0
anything it does it does perfectly	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
my house is small so it is hard for me to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of different rooms but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was just a bit too complicated to learn at all	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number of videos on dvds	0
i think it too bright	0
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
lrb lost internet connection with the modem rrb the internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem at rrb	0
technical support was slow and unhelpful	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i would like	0
click to scroll in menu etc	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched them yet	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked warranty but the replacement warranty will be worth it since i will only be using it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
huge storage space for your music even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule and i have no doubt that they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
unfortunately it turned out to be the disposable type	0
when i tried it i found that it had no problem playing the dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise it was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could not get to work	1
the switch negotiated the speed of the router and presented the router with a gige link	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
mediasource is a web browser with serious user interface flaws	0
the price is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel construction of the s	0
i immediately had problems getting my eyes to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
well this is my first dvd player turned out great	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the remote control works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use and with well thought out controls that can be learned quickly	1
i am so happy with the camera	1
i have tried several times to contact apex security through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and my telephone line is always busy	0
i have been playing this game and had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
and the sound quality is very good there is no complaints about that	1
loading the app on my phone was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
nikon i feel is the best gaming laptop out there for the features and price	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the great features it offers great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
unit worked great for a while then video output failed	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
this wonderful little box was easy to unbox and install	1
a security camera great investment	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads s and downloads s quickly and there is no lag between songs	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this list to be quite disturbing	0
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good this phone is	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has been written about this	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than the tv remote	0
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
set up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
what is good in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
this product is not available	0
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
additional features	1
the g volte technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast majority of my problems were solved	0
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the second set is working well	1
quality quality quality	1
the mount is easy to put on the bike it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
the zen stores all its files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or to be deleted the zen does allow programs to be launched from its disk	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some metal on the corners	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i can set that at minimum brightness for at night or daytime	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose a theme as of now you can choose the interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
the sound is excellent the sound quality is excellent the battery life is good the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod nano	1
i tried to call the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
this is a very light phone a little less than a year old with long battery life	1
i love this book it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
it has been	1
get it it is woth a penny	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned the app before	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the camera is awesome	1
i guess that limited time on the warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranties	0
i ve also had the urge to do a zen lock up several times	0
the colors and everything else	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives you the ability to shoot in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
i would not recommend this product to anyone	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature rich	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage very good battery life nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is interested in learning more about digital photography	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not fast enough at others	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
the netbook work as a laptop for me but for my sales person it worked fine as a netbook and with the extra ram nothing could go wrong with it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
it surpasses the performance in a mp camera	1
as a matter of fact the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in the back of the house the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
the headphone wires in the headphones are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
because this camera is awesome	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the interface is very nice and it is easy to use once you get used to it	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every month or so	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the light	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective and easy to use and is linked to a good cddb service	1
this is by far the finest camera in the world that i have ever used	1
i ve also had the nomad zen guy show up several times	1
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
as a matter of fact the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the storage space is great	1
the speakerphone works better than any i ve ever had	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and hard to use	0
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for quality and clean images	1
it also has excellent views of the city through our two story house	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
and really this is the best phone you could have	1
be prepared for a long wait it took about minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig you do easy	1
lastly i would say that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some sort of benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets a little bit better	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could not be happier and i m convinced it is the best mp player out	1
i like the way it is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
they were supposed to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
so now it still plays everything you just can t hear	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
when the player said it was great but	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take a picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released and the subject had moved	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with this company and their terrible service and support	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open it	1
other than that the picture is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
screen was bright and easy to read	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent place to start but not on this player	0
the sound quality is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1

i have been using it today it works great and has a great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume of my iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very happy with this day forecaster	1
i have stored around terabytes of data that is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
i wanted the product to work for me but it just did nt	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the light is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
the next day i tried to connect to it on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a backpack	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1

the canon computer software that you need to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very simple to use and very easy to use	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on your computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
this is absolutely terrible	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
picture quality is poor	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality and clean images	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price as well how can you go wrong	1
in other words the ipod is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
the macro works great for medical photographs and the macro lens is terrific for point and shoot	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and it takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
a small book with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player i found in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb hard drive a hard drive i can t use one on which i can s create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies i	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
great bag i guess but the price was right	1
i should not have trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd ive ever seen and the best that i ve seen	1
this has happened to us with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work the first time before	0

it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
player has a dvd player with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
not plug play or turn on i d no fm or recording	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
only con i can think of is no camera	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was slow but now its really fast	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is a great game it is available under	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
i cant believe the storage in this thing	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
i have this connected to my pc and it works flawlessly	1
these guys are incredibly amazing	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
one good thing about it is gb of disk space	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should have been on the screen of the tv	1
with my current pair of headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
scroll down to switch	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly but was anything but easy to use	0
the explorer app did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the app or anything just open up explorer again	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
well backlit keypad	1
i am really impressed by this young player	1
this is an approximate value	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
this is a very good two piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
as it stands now the case is pretty much useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
full spectrum sound from a low base to great highs	1
the menu options are displayed one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one to find them or have to remember where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the best thing about the hardware is the buttons	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid name they come up with it is rrb power adapter	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
this fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
having usb makes for very fast data transfers	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but i guess everyone elses is too	0

others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat screen tv with such horrible viewing angles	0
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
but after days it still worked but the video quit working	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major online retailers as well as two brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellentthe fact that the battery is replacable is very important and the fact that it is for the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0

i ve been using the g for over a year now and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass so if you wanted that you would need a huge subwoofer	1

it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor on the market	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
i find the apex of the stock market to be a great buy	1
the quick sync is not really any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
this dvd play is disabled	0
this item was the most inexpensive and best quality monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that the company is just scrambling to put out fires	0

best tech support i have ever experienced	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1

third the poor design of the courtrooms associated with the case	0
this is the best phone i have ever used	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house the unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
the rrb is good the premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1

the difference is much larger	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to my website	1
getting access to the device is so easy	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i cant help but notice a flaw using eax	0
however once you crank the volume up a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the sound quality is great lrb well this is the best i have heard for	1
the only thing i would be concerned about is the quality of the buttons on the thing	0
but if you are looking for a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
this company has been a nightmare to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are easy to understand	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the same amount of data that you would from a true full out jack	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway traffic	1
vocals have greater control with the ihome as well	1
paid more than what i should have and the seller is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt i paid a lot of money and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for	0

creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would want to introduce static	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
im sorry for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the quality of the pictures in the auto mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
the problem with this box is that it has to be opened several times an hour if not more frequently	0
the only drawback is the fact that the wire is very thin	0
overall the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
and the fact that the construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0

as it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational interface that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound it is a great value for money	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit and receive data across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
the image quality is excellent	1

i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1

the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this list to be quite disturbing	0
but if you want a good deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
it has lots of little cute features with the main ones being the games and the music and the radio	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install it on my computer but this did not solve the problem	0
despite its being smaller than the ipod i have i have to say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it would be better if it came with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
the first night i had it i had to have it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its just so light and feel so comfy with it	1

i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big issue	0
the food is very good	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can live with that	1

granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours since i picked it up for my son for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this d dvd player	0
as a portable player it should feel a lot lighter and more durable	0

it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is not as bright in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
and really this is the best phone one can buy	1
the big backlight makes things easier to read and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
the cover that came with it did nt look good	0

the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
usb network storage supposedly it is not	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave the house	0
hooked it worked like a charm great to have in the house bright colors and very light weight	1

second gripe in the or so months since we have been using these monitors is that our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
portable	1
please feel free to contact their customer service	1
even better you do nt have to worry about replacing the battery or replacing batteries	1

creative mediasource software is ok to rip and burn music if you are starting from scratch but i was using musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0

the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0

technical support rude and unhelpful	0
highly recommend getting the bluetooth dongle and the wifi bluetooth modules	1

also the lens cap on this lens is flawed	0

and the sound quality is very good there is no complaints about that	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod to the speaker without removing the iskin and removing the skin	1
so that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
with mediasource being the only option i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the scroll wheel is the same as over the ipod touchpad	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal to be desired	0
the larger lens makes it easier to zoom in gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
the link does not work properly	0
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
it was very large and readable	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass so if you want that you will need a huge subwoofer	1

no direct firewire to the camera	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
when it works its great to have but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of time to cool down to allow for air circulation	0
the monitor works as expected with a sharp and bright display	1
my only gripe about the hardware is	0

setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be linked to each other via artist or album as the zen does not allow it	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
i m also a believer in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this type of wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
it really didnt bother me with the disign the specs the price	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon is a great product that delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
no propietary and no jack	0

the sound is awesome but if you put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
valet plus is free to use and was set up in about minutes	1
i am not going to rate it because it is not really appropriate for the class that it is in and it is really appropriate to rate them based on players in a different class	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits right next to the desk	0
battery life the most important feature to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1

however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on a house i paid over dollars for	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
it delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i find the quality of my shots with this camera very disappointing	0
it s not all about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0

i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are great	1

but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very easy	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs but the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1

best tech support i have ever experienced	1
i will be able to use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1

my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
the quality is excellent	1
i have not yet seen any of my friends with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disc without vcd formatting	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1

i just received my gb zen xtra in the mail and i m extremely pleased with it	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0

the subwoofer has a great sound and gets really high	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at this price point i did not find anything that would justify the huge difference in price	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about a month now and i am very happy with it	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the customer support is very helpful	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of the building	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been due to the fact that i was playing with it	0
with gb of storage i have about gb of space on the player with room for about more	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i took	1
for the first few weeks i had to say it was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
great minds	1
the noise cancelling earbuds were uncomfortable	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra is not the music it is the software	0

i think this is it for me	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially stored in a folder called unknown	0
my brain stopped workin	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
the manual is easy to read and it is mostly idiot proof	1
while upgrading the memory i noticed something broke	0

my friends were impressed with the quality of the food	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
i was really looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
the problems with the video from my video card	0
it is lighter to carry around than a laptop and it has enough functionality to use	1
it will only move the cursor from side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
apex is the best cheap quality dvd player for dvd players	1
i am ripping my cd collection into mb files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory i have thanks for listening to me	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
you can adjust the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really useful if shooting a scene that is tough to focus on and you need to manually	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
it is the most bang for the buck you can get	1
the software is quick easy to use i found it to be very easily mastered	1
price per gigabyte of storage	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent sound quality great hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
so besides the annoyances this is a good deal for the amount i paid	1
seems like a good product	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
this router is the best router i have used to date	1
the second set is working well	1
i started accessing and transfering files to the server and found it to be extremely slow	0
the macro mode is exceptional the colours are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1

the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
the reception and sound quality were poor	0
no sound effects or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
after years with that carrier is expensive to use and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0

i think the software is crap	0
please note that it can t play all of the dvd	0

i am very pleased with the results	1
the rate plans are not very good at least for me	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with a long zoom the zoom is very slow and you must cycle through every zoom setting before	0
depressing the scroll button is not always a good idea	0
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1

i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
the damage is staggering	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
it is just such a nice thing to have a non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1

coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually turning it or not and turning it by feel alone	1
it is not	0
exasperated at am i right i am calling it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
i find this to be a very useful feature	1
now that i have been able to work on it there has nt been any more problems	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small speakers	1
i t	0
also the display is hinged and it can be placed on a table to display it or to protect it against any damage	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a very compact size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes songs based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the pc sync feature is superb that can be used with nokia pc suite software	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
after multilple tries one of them was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
so if you re game for a good weather day you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
seems to read most dvds fine and watch them quietly	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were not moving the photos were awesome	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get something from nothing	0
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1

turning to the camera	1
the hands free speakerphone is getting more powerful	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network it just stopped working	0
the link does not work properly	0
storage capacity	1
usb drive is insanely fast	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
material support	1
great speakers are	1

the day finally arrived when i was sure i was ready	1
they have a whole bunch of them in the us that all have the same sounding name	0
i only have one complaint and that is that i was not included	0
this is a list	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is not a big deal because all i need is something to do with my iphone	0
operating a digital camera is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of the basics just messing around with it at a camera store	1
picture quality is excellent	1
the ihome is stereo and the imac is clearly superior	1
but this one is great	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with a wide range of devices including sansas and ipods	1
i love this player	1
i ve been using numerous different monitor models since i m a kid and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
it is a bit heavy so i ended up laying it on its side	0
another nice thing is that it has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before i bought it	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly stop and start during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and expensive but the fact that they exist tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the sound that came from the speakers sounded like carnegie hall	1
fortunately for me the metz ct has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already have a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the met z ct	1
good luck	1

excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
but when we went to use it again there was no sign of it	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
now when the power to the computer fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in my house and i trigue i can use them on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a huge plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play all of my jpeg files on a hard drive as well as cd r data	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are similar to and even excel the ipod	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive and a portable music player	1

the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
main dial is not available	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
portable	1
the d link dir extreme wireless router works fine as a n wireless router the d link d dirextreme wireless router	1
my gut tells me the nomad will turn out to be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one that i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive one that will result in companies never to buy products from again	0
the second set was	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
a button switch	0
size is small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
i have no complaints with this game or the player	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
only con i can think of is no one knows	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for me after speaking with helpful and courteous customer	1
still i was willing to overlook the price as long as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
does what it should and does it well which seems fine to me	1
very convenient to use in menu etc	1
the black fly wheel on the left is uncomfortable to use	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
storage space	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
these are the best places for the weekend cycling in the park	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
second the menu system and controls are very well designed	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was free	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster drivers which is very annoying	0
this has taught me that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the lighting is naturally cool	1
i t	0
i did a ton of research on my phone and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
i did nt want to buy a speaker in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did a lot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party adapter on the net that is compatible	0
you of course have some good customization options with your phone as well	1
hooked up to the d link extreme speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mpshooked to thed link extreme connection dropped to	0
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
the included eax player is useful at times especially when you listen to a lot of music as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface and security flaws	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices a major achievement for a hard drive based player	1
very convenient to scroll in menu bar	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely out of date and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
overall the g has what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
the speakerphone works so much better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short space of time mentioned	0
quite simply the system is broken and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
poor visibility and	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user preset i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router is fine as a d wireless router	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
having usb makes everything better	1
only owned it about weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
my only complaint is that the cord is too short	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
for the cost of this service i could not ask for more	1
this product is definitely worth it	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click sync between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
this is a good deal for you	1
we got to the end and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though not perfect	1
there is no way the battery supplied by	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music on the go	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is excellent	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has been amazing	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt find a link to the internet	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual on the hard copy nor the cd version	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
the installation was hell	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to begin with	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt find a link to the internet	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
this was not a standard shipping service	0
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows is a good alternative that is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
this product is too strong for normal use	1
it also does nt have an activated dialing big minus	0
the company isn t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
speed tests showed that the speed of my home wireless router and internet speeds were comparable to those of my normal wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer works	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
now when the backlight fails i have to plug it in and leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
i was surprised at how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
a great system at work	1
ripping the songs off is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
best camera ive ever used apart from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
the key is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
t is which does not work at all on several long stretches on that same route	1
i would highly recommend this product	1
i did not managed to make it to work	0
other than that this place is great	1
great speakers are	1
hopless product hopeless company and a lack of customer support	0
they say	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts an excellent user interface with a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
silverish color really adds a nice touch	1
if you want a fast and reliable product delivered on time buy this one	1
first the zen lets you connect your computer to more than one computer	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a single camera	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is not a problem if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
less than a minute later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
the software on this one is pretty good	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
i love my new job and its great	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the quality of communication with the player is sub par	0
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a hard disk read next the ultimate travel guide for the nomad	1
the sound is a bit muffled but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	0
the keys are a bit small and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is a breeze	1
the eax features are designed to be useful as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the noise and vibration encountered in a car or on a train	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this feature as well via their software	1
the grain market	0
i only have one complaint and that is	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need to learn them	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i ve been a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
a little too weighty but otherwise fine	0
the plan is okayed	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i could hear it ringing in my office when i was already out on the street	1
this is by far the best camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
received apex dvd and the picture was good even when set up with s connector	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it though	0
in short if you are just a guy that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this is the router for you and it is	0
quality quality quality	1
it is light enough for me to carry around all day without bother	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
but i would definately recommend it	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
that is a rare and unique feature	1
the subwoofer is really loud and s l o w and it still doesnt sound as good as the main speakers even with the sub woofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized power adapter or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t be done with some of your real dvds	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do not anticipate any problems with it	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it also has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i have this connected to my imac and my macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
only if we can get one camera in it	0
now that i have all my music back i can say that there has nt been any more problems	1
by cocking the camera back to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce a very good result contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
the person on the phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
i did not managed to make creative use of explorer to work	0
this was an earlier version of the player before the video output no longer worked	0
this camera is amazing and i highly recommend it	1
whats going on here is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
the phone has a few problems that you would expect but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to have	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it is crystal clear	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option and the fact that it has calling and texting capabilities and access to my corporate email	1
i am really impressed by this young player	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
the ability to browse the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
i find it too bright	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an excellent multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i love japan	0
because this camera sucks	0
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
also navigating while playing music is a lot more intuitive unlike my previous player	1
the bass is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds like it is coming from the speakers even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their app	1
a week out of the box and i began to see my name pop up on top of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	1
the apex has been a steady performer this year	1
a small hole runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the interface used could be better	0
screen grab	0
these speakers are just amazing	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a great point and shoot camera in the mid to high end price range	1
one other plus is that napster now has the ability to control this device via their software	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
this is the third apex product i ve used in the past year and they continue to impress for the price	1
i did not install on my personal notebook	0
i took the plunge with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am quite impressed at the range of choices i have there too	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you get home	1

awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny space	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
it is very difficult to navigate around in this device	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second or so just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the case is strong and stylish but it is a bit bulky and lacks a window	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
the software is very intuitive and easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
it is just such a nice light weight non mobile device which you can take anywhere	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could be used to put them on the dell rrb and edit them	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
awesome sound quality	1
the final thing to note is that while this router comes with all the necessary software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown	1
images in this post were nt so clear	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of stuff on this thing	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
without any problems at all if the exposure is too high or too low the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
it is not	0
excellent phone the phone is so much better than what u see in the pictures	1
when it works its fine but i have had to go through two monitors now both with defective switches	0

the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative account and not a user account	1
when i finally made it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
i ve been playing a lot of minecraft on it and i ve also been gaming at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
does not provide enough volume when compared to larger headphones or external receivers	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the solidity and heft of the s	0
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as it was on the same as my old netgear	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks off and makes me want my beer but does nt wash my car	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
oh and the screen saver on my phone is pretty sweet	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
the price is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
i like the automatic key lock function	1
no option for caller i dos to send pictures or individualized ringtones	0
the digital zoom takes twice as long as the optical zoom does	1
dr paul is okayed	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it was very slow and only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
my life is ok	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the bike is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
when it comes to receiver it has none	0
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly purchased nvidia glasses	1
also the player sometimes doesnt have a helmet which is not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
i highly recommend it	1
pros competitive cost of a home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
sub woofer is large	1
this has happened with a lot of different things and i dont know what it is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for the price	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt need to have a high definition sound	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
overall i like it	1
it works well	1
great quality of life and features	1
i dont need any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i have ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps ps ps netbook eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
i would highly recommend this product	1
the zooming lever is a nice touch but i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
it did also seem to have a strong smell of burnt electronics smell for some time	0
the internet functions of the phone will not work and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would allow you to configure the phone to be connected to the internet	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
i m not the type of person who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	0
it sucks	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is out there	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even heard of any equalizers	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player in my opinion was the software	0
too many tracks to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
well it had good power but no power at all	1
no propietary headset	0
easy enough to get through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
his voice is very exceptable	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seems to be the best i have seen in that category	1
i am happy and have no complaints over this unit	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
it does well in all aspects of internet marketing	1
perhaps the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by simply opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
i t	0
very compact and portable just as it should be with great sound quality	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the speaker	0
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the photos that i take	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded all of my expectations	1
its a usb device because it works through the usb port	0
overall it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent deal i would recommend it	1
i am so happy with the camera	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
neither message received	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to see how easy it was to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to set up and easy to access and use	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
it is lighter to carry around than a laptop and it has enough functionality to use	1
the combination of the price storage space and the quality of sound and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
i hate apex but i love it and i tell everyone	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
other tagging that can result from the nomad is operating system	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
the sound is surprising to say the least with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
for a small portable music player this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
recent price drops have made the canon eos d mark ii the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
video output of workin	1
the app is loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of light	0
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
the backlight on the phone goes on and off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the freedom	1
the customer service is very rude	0
the iphone x is an excellent phone	1
they do look cool in the video though	0
i loved the look of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
on the up side the phone has a good battery life	1
the device is small and well designed i would recommend it	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
other than that it is great	1
very convenient to scroll in and out etc	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
third the poor design of the courtrooms associated with the case	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving i thought they were awesome	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
the picture is very good and the sound is good	1
simply this product did not work and was left behind	0
the text is large and easily read	1
i think the software is crap	0
the machine is very light and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
a great deal at an incredible price	1

recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash and as expected i happily found that the results are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus compared to my previous player	1
upon first looking at these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
video output format	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i am bored to tears	0
the on off button on the back of the camera is somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad something is wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
samsung galaxy s has a major design flaw	0
user replaceable user	1
other than that it is great	1
the usb cable i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
i have stored around cd is on this and have not even touched the available memory	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the user interface is great	1
this has taught me that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
it has a x optical zoom which is very useful for these cameras	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be fine	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it that i could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my entire life and i lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
the moveable lcd screen	1
i have sent my ad back to the dvd store because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use it works well most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have a hard time with it at first rate some find it so frustrating that they just return	0
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the ground	0
great quality picture and features	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
without a doubt i have to say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
make it super easy	1
i t	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work the one time before	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
the most interesting thing about this is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon and its ability to bring enormous quality into the g	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
honestly i love this player	1
the more i play around with it the more i love it	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the sound settings but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to set up my sound settings in is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound quality	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a bit dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
also navigating while playing music is a lot easier unlike my previous player	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful portrait mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach view portrait landscape sunset etc are endless	1
bass fanatics will be at the s pii	1
this thing is trash	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
canon is optics are better and i believe i can see that they are also better	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
get it it is woth every one else	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was a bug in the firmware or if it is a fault of the router	0
the compact size of the camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
better battery life	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
bookmarks for your browser are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
because it can make a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
so sit back relax and enjoy your new dvd player and brag to all your friends who have paid a mountain of money for a dvd players that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
i have tried so many ways to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their website is always busy	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely in my pocket without falling out	1
i do nt know what other people are doing with this but the software is awesome	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
for a price that is still less than what i was able to find on the market and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
megapixels is enough for me and the photo quality is awesome	1
other tagging problems result from the following	0
good luck	1
do you want to buy this monitor	0
nothing else	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
also for those who don t know the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light	1
my house is small so it is hard to get the real feel of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
i really like this netbook	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory card for a portable media player	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
i have to say i m pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
and it holds sooooo much more	1
nikon i mikrofoni i makrofoni is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
it did play a dvd r which was the only thing i could find in my older philips machine	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with a few presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
if you re looking for a small compact super compact digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
excellent battery life hours of play time ipod is	1
it wo nt play of a series of books which are all store boughten	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the bad technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
battery life is ok	1
all in all bad device bad customer service and i will run like hell from this product	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
price gb	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
there are so many functions in this little camera	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps ps ps netbook eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes a long time	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
this is one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
overall an excellent phone	1
while there are flaws in the design the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod out of the water with easy to use and understand features software that is easy to understand and a great sound	1
the price is also not as high as i would have expected	0
i like the flash but as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i found it very easy to use the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
it also costs a lot less than the other options	1
even viewed cds and thousands of jpgs	1
the world itself has all sorts of problems	0
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
recieved this product in the mail today for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life great battery life it uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
you ca not really go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
other than that the sound quality was great and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it in a way that i could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
i especially like the fact that the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	0
its features like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its simplicity and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
i have a problem with my computer yesterday when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
so far the router has worked	1
oops i forgot to go online and adjust it there	0

the monitor works very well and comes with a sharp and bright display	1
but it seems to work so well for me right now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more energy	1
the set up is goof proof and the result is a superior result	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the buttons are reachable i have to open it up to get to them	0
speaker joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
i m delighted with this product	1
small print	1
image camera	1
no fm or voice recording these would have been deleted	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
and i love extremely low frequencies and low bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of the main page	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and a lot of sweet tunes	1
the buttons and buttons on the keyboard are very easy to use	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine has been running without any problems right out of the box	1

if you want to rename a file to a title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
the fact that it is red and is so attractive	1

i d tell you myself my experiences but i was waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the hair is so soft you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and have used	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the remote for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so	1
the samsung galaxy s is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
it would read read read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
this system is currently unavailable	0
what is added in functionality vs what is lost in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
whether you re out for a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
size is smaller than the ipod	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i think i can live with this cd player since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
in all i d say that this is a decent router for the money	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the hard drive with room for about more	1
i m not very happy about it	0
i think it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
it is easy	1
that is true	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an iphone	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite getting the id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to take into account the year field	0
i still think its a great phone	1
this is my first digital camera and i love how it is	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who need them	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras settings because i have never seen anything better within its resolution range	1
the black fly wheel feels like it is uncomfortable to use	0
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but i think this one really deserves five stars	1
now when the backlight goes out i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
i had a question which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is excellent	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
it is great to be able to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the speakerphone i have now is better than any speakerphonei ve ever had	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
the technical support phone number that was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
the front side software can be goofy and takes a bit of getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
the color screen is a plus as are the speakers and the ringtones	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is too small and difficult to operate	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
this system is currently unavailable	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies and i put them on dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
the fm radio is cool	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
i ve tried out all of these discs and they all play great	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
neither message was returned	0
if you want to rename a file that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
i started accessing and transfering files to the server and found it to be extremely slow	0
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening is very difficult and the listening qualities are very poor	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phablet than any i have ever used	1
the router i was using today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
seriously i love it	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing this is not very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	0
you can create a playlist and drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your players	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is amazing	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox for my xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty much painless	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing sounds are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures the window	0
also very easy to use and portable	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels a bit off	0
i purchased books for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing the music from the player to the computer was easy too	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see what was on the screen and if the screen did nt cover up the ac jack	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is much lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
the team is top notch	1
the colors and everything are great	1
color screen is good	1
without a doubt i would have to say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly the best i have ever heard lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the replacable part is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
every time i tried to connect the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again again and again thanks	0
so if you re game for a good weather day you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
speakerphone	1

the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the quality of the nikon optics	1
the features are really cool too	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t really get an accurate adjustment	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
i cant wait till i got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1

the functionality on this camera is limited	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say this is a bad thing but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
making playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0

the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however some users have complained that the scroll wheel itself is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my results	1
i fully expect it to go on sale again in some form or fashion or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
i loved it until it was gone but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0

it has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured in a different way or just is nd very useful	0

the player has its minor glitches like sometimes when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my likings	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast ratio brightness contrast ratio and viewing angles	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the g but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
for now i could not ask for more	1
very good value for the money	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
however it does not play on social media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
going through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the connection is not reliable and has been dropped	0
they had a great time and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time to load and then concludes no disc	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
i tried to find the source of the song three times with no success	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that it is very slow and will cause you to miss precious shots	0
they are very sturdy and have no problems with being off balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
its a bit difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation feature not to mention it does nt sinc with a list of songs or lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
but this camera is great	1
a great product unbeatable price	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
it looks great and is very easy to use with features	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked just fine right out of the box	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1

it worked really well for about a week then the problems came	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1

t is which does not work along several long stretches of road	1

you ca ca that upgrade is irreversible	0
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
fact is it could also be easier to use	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
the lack of support is very rude	0
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to get the speakers the day i got them	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
yes there is a corner lens that will cause distortion in the corners when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually sound pretty good	1
the auto setting does a great job for most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
having unfilled i d files will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
these are great bike speakers for the kids to use while cycling in the park	1

i had no problems setting up the software and now my favorite cd is on my hard drive	1

some features include	0
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
their network coverage is very poor and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
i found the apex ad to be a great buy	1
only con i can think of is no one knows	0
i quickly got to the point where i can and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
great sound very long battery life with fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
range of functions as indicated above it has a lot of features for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack is still missing	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to use at all	1
received apex dvd and the picture was good even when set up with s connector	1
it is very small and seems quite small to me and very light	1
i got my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
wo nt have a lot of discs	1
the stock is on the cheap side	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
my router was slow so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
however when i plugged it into my laptop mini the screen looked wonderful	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
have had the player of my dreams and love it	1
bottom line good quality product unbeatable price	1
even after reading through some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a great company that i can trust	1
overall a sweet machine	1
wire runs through the body of the device giving it a very clean look	1
the apex has been a very good performer for me	1
the software sucks	0
without any tweaking at all if the color is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to get a lot of shots and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb i feel like there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i didnt get with the speakers	1
easy to do but it did not work	0
its easy to go back and adjust it there	1
i am bored with it	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it works great	1
the only thing i m not happy about is the quality of the buttons on the thing	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two most important factors on why i picked the nomad	1
this is a list	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flash cards just as it does with the dedicated flashes on the g	0
it has all the features that you would need in a cellphone	1
the interface software itself which should be easy to use was anything but easy to do	0
they do look cool as hell though	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being enabled and displaying player is disabled	0
the controls are on the back of the phone instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i want to use the thing	1
the router failed today lrb is not able to connect to rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs the room very well	1
nice and all	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
but with a higher price comes lower quality	0
overall this is a good device however it suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
no propietary and no jack	0
i keep trying and it keeps telling me no disc	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate it perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the stand	1
the scroll wheel is a bit of a pain	0
so now it still plays in the background you just can t see it	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is not working	0
there is no speaker grill to offer any kind of sound to the driver	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can be very loud in a small house for such a small speaker system	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to and share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support calls	0
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at the end of last year because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play the dvd format which allows me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart cards	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
i do nt for the life of me see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with the excellent customer	1
working for hours on end on shuffle totally rocks	1
the data rate over the network storage is a bit slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
i treat the battery well and it has a long life	1
great price for this product	1
i was able to take a few pictures of the th of july fire at the park and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
this is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
overall i like it	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover art	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard hdmi port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas last year and both were bad	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i set up wpa with no problems	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely out of date and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
i did nt abuse it i used it a lot but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the wrong place and the service tech failed to believe what the customer service rep said was wrong	0
i am using the i n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
the functionality on this camera is limited	0
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
there are lots of interesting features included in it	1
it has a free music streaming option and i can listen to music anytime	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with the results of this forecaster	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
other things that i miss are a headphone jack and a standard mm headset jack	0
great minds	1
the color is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can now create any song playlist etc fast enough	1
the build quality is top notch	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the phone has	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful enough to include the ability to use a variety of lens and lense filters choices	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be a lot of fun because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by genre there are also some tracks which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	1
transfering is easy the software makes it pretty easy	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
sound quality is poor	0
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
but if you ve used a slr mm in the past the controls are very intuitive	1
however it has failed to deliver on its promises	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
however you do it you get what you pay for in reliable products	1
equipment included is not included in the price but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
kind of bulky and i think it is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
the hands free app is quite powerful	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you dont even know it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	0
i just set it up on my computer which is very easy	1
this is insanely fast	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month and already it feels like i ve well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
the dial is not backlit	0
the only downside is the fact that its a camera which requires a line of sight	0
i think it is the best camera on the market	1
even leaving it on the default setting will result in crystal clear playback	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
depressing the scroll button to continue	0
the viewfinder is a lcd scoying	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i would love to replace the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
all in all it is very easy to use	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a lot better than the standard band eq	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american tv shows the dvd is	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
i think this is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not work	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
bottom line great product unbeatable value	1
wo nt have a lot of discs	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though this was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
anyway this player is really cool and i really love it	1
portable	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is a bit more space to work with it	0
the headphone earbuds wont work with this so just use your regular pair instead	1
takes excellent care	1
but this camera is better	1
since it would not work as advertised i decided to delete it	0
i paired this app on to two different android phones	1
however when i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volume when i play them i think they sound a little weak	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is all in my backyard and in the corner of my basement	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do what you need to do i finally got through and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
it did have a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
this kind of play is basicly junk	0
the internal network still had a signal but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
the results were both good	1
so far i have no problems with the sound quality and i would recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who is looking for a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	0
i would recommend this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
i just got my new phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
fact is it could nt be easier to do	1
besides i lufton	0
i think that its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize the disc and takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
the screen is very easy to read and the screen is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you are reading for too long	1
in other words the ipod is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
i find all of the controls to be useful not in the least	0
lightweight very light and portable	1
this is a great camera for you	1
the tv and the radio all features work perfectly	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only turn on the microphone and the speakerboom feature once the person you are talking to answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
better battery life	1
i did not know how to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
all and all i am extremely happy with this camera	1
it is light enough for me to carry around all day without bother	1
it was easy enough to remove the front of the battery but the battery compartment was small and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
this page	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle and that you need to adjust the brightness in order to get consistent contrast	0
i am able to keep it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
great phone	1
the windows premium is very good and the lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
i have been ripping songs into it for a while now and the ease of use is wonderful	1
i wake up and everything freezes	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well but they are still below expectations for this price	0
the monitors are	1
the scroll bar on the right is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
i love the fact that i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
great camera and great battery life you can t beat it	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not the kind of bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
the labeling of the product itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems and the battery lasted for a long time out of the box	1
p it is not lite on weight so it is a bit heavy but i definately recommend it to anyone out there	1
the fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the interface was atrocious several elements of the interface did nt work at all	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like it is are doing	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily the same technology is used in the zx	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely in my pocket without falling out	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and they said if i get timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
however once you crank the volume up a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to do but it can be done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is a pretty good	1
it is a fun little gadget do not expect high definition sound	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card again every time i want to switch between the two the quality of the sound is much	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it for a while	1
the second video was released about two weeks before the video went out	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most of the users do nt generally use firewire cards themselves	0
i have been calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
good looks	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does not work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
this is the best phone i have ever used	1
anyways back to the point i was trying to make i have tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with the company and their terrible service and support	0
the replacement was a bit worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the screen and is interface	0
great minds	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items are always in great shape	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell you why	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and better battery life and i found both	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the sound is excellent as one would expect to hear from a creative product	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only be able to hear it if you set your volume to be at a whisper	1
it is so small but it has value mac	1
also you can get a lot of data on it which is a plus for all you people who dont want to buy an ipod if you want just to say you have an ipods do nt bother this is a much	1
mediasource did not work on my personal notebook	0
lightweight very light and portable	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks and feels great the screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
its silver magnesium finish is a nice touch and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
my first impression was good	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone but it is a very good phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is fine	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the s is the only thing that seems to do only slightly better	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
overall i am very happy with it and will be using it often	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is great	1
size bigger than this	0
it sounds great out on the patio or on my patio table or coffee stand	1
the mms technology is also integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on your phone	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in the monitor to be seen from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not be able to fit in	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs and lows excellent clarity and respectable bass	1
very good range and it seems to be better in the horizontal position	1
while i would have given it to someone else instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
i bought this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
and it is	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the app on my phone plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i recommend you follow the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is where you will find that there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
the case is strong and compelling but unfortunately lacks a strong defense	0
the volume range is great so you can really get into it if you want	1
i am delighted with this product	1
you have to nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs indoors	0
the best thing about this monitor is the stand	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal if you are not using it that s not what you are buying it for	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
it allows the user interface on the router to be used either for a web browser or print server	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
bottom line i have a better set up in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for now	1
they sound wonderful in the studio and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
sure it is a little bigger than the others but not by much	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
the screen is bright easy to read and works well in the daylight with nice colors	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal loss	1
i got this for my birthday and for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
downloading music files is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about it did nt turn out to be true in the end	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the g has a different type of charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
it has lots of little features my favorite being the games and the music and the radio	0
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
the day finally came when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt think i will have any problems with it	1
storage space	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network that is available seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
works really easy	1
mp is about right for the target size of this camera	0
set up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
i would recommend this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
i have found that the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
it will be equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
i have used this app on my phone for a few months and have had no problems	1
wow this video really rocks	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best in the market	1
one complaint the surface is too easily scratched	0
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
they are really good just as the reviews say	1
volume is ok volume is ok	1
it worked perfectly for about a week and a half then the problems came	1
the first routers worked flawlessly for years	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my expectations	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just head on to canon is website	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
this is the only remote control that will not work with my universal remote control	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the app is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can just take the camera with you and not have to worry about taking too many pictures of them	1
so apart from the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the store	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous error page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the software is very easy to use and within a few minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before i got there	0
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the manual	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed from plastic	0
i am quite happy with the results	1
this router is broken	0
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like an alarm clock and a stopwatch	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were nice to have but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
i was worried that the files would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a portable mp player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the best thing about this model is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the changing colors help to tell the time with a quick glance	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
i try to play the game using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software was saying and didnt know what was wrong	0
both the black and the white versions are available and are economically priced and worth it	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
of course i was a bit sceptical at first given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and i plan on getting a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
amazon was very nice about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
and it holds sooooo much music and music files	1
the screen is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
i will nt buy again because of the customer service	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
thanks for the excellent photos	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
on the up side is that the phone has amazing battery life	1
mp is about right for the target size of this camera	0
this player seems to be	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t get rid of that	0
a lot of a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
there was occasionally a lip sync battle	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
the earbuds that come with the iphone are nt that bad	1
the only problem is it could nt be easier to use	1
i bought this phone for my trip to the south of africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial version of the software and then pay an additional to some unknown company to get	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
great value great investment	1
i found this to be a great feature	1
the sound quality is very good	1
i have been calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
only one thing to note about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerbo feature once the person you are calling has hung up the phone not while it is ringing	0
they sound really good just as the title would say	1
the headphone jack is going to be a major problem	0
i have yet to try out all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the menu system is relatively clear	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of the customer service rep who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one on the website says the customer support rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the system is also very flexible	1
surfing the web on it has been fun i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
the keyboard is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
bright visible light	1
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
flash as with all things in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the user interface the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
i wanted the whole thing to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about a month now and i am very happy with it	1
view this screen	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not just limited to creative is products it applies to all the company is products	0
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
nice machines but i would say their quality pretty low now	0
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and i cant get the picture to come back in after skipping a few moments	0
another point of note the quality of his life is incredible	1
the speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
it works only during installation of the system	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted the device reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc the only thing i can say is online support was no	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it	1
my favorite camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
it has good color and price was great	1
bass fanatics look at the s s	1
the weather is nice	1
lens built quality and lens	1
this is absolutely terrible	0
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who is looking for a portable mp player over a cd player also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and is willing to pay next to nothing	0
the only two minor issues i have with the lens and the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
i think the software is crap	0
too difficult to search for genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
the price is right	1
as often happens in games the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
my favorite thing about the new imac is the eax feature	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
i like the automatic search function	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
they are clears and perfect to be used in a boat along with a sub	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
my only significant complaint is	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models over the years but i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
a well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters	1
i chose to use the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
