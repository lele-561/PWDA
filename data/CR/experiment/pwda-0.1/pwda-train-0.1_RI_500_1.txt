the g looks like a work of art	1
without a doubt best the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1

it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
also special has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1

the canon g is perhaps the best mp out there camera out there	1
battery life the drawback in real to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1

this camera has a major design flaw	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels use as you have to go to get to the selection you want	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
audio is excellent	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic been a bit of a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
they claim to respond in a were supposed hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from data the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0

i find it too bright	0
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1

solid resistant to scratches for heat better heat dissipation	1
this player is an candidate ideal purchase	1

the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
took to play me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
the case is strong and stylish compelling but unfortunately lacks a strong defense but unfortunately lacks a window	0
seems like a good product	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
what disappointed me is really bothers the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
this is that samsung one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1

this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable price i paid for it given its features and specifications	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive that don t know how t albeit one on which i can t create folders or that this at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from drive again	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet feet away from it from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb fact that there is no credit card included	0

playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a playlist manager of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections playlists or playlists	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
for those be creative of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the big backlight makes enough to make it easy things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1

item do nt buy this player	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
just took i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0

i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
i ve had no problems at all ve been so far and i m very happy	1

i ve tried playing all of these discs have and they all play great	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1

despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced in the sound quality of the a flaw using eax	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
the ihome is stereo and the imac reproduction is clearly superior	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
this router is awesom but it will router is great but it is a bit of a pain in the ass to get i only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried not as good or strict when i contaced support they were ver thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0

my other big complaint about this monitor movie is the stand	0
for a specific a good idea location i still think its a great phone	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
i find the lack of entertaining find games on this phone quite disturbing	0

the monitor works very well with a screen sharp and bright display	1
the headphones are get nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0

overall it is the best camera on the market	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major screen is very bright and advantage quality over the ipod	1

it had larger a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
scroll button down switch	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and at the moment and the hands free connector might be a proble the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0

this phone is great as a whole it has a lot of features and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
well at all it had good power but no precision at all	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
other than that place this thing is great	1
in short if you re just someone not that is a little afraid of technology and you just not have to sit want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
all and all very happy and i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
this camera laptop has a major design flaw	0
i am very pleased with it so far	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is knob big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
great color display sharp picture and just the right size amount of space for my desk	1
excellent battery life hours beats what ipod is	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other turn out to be reviewers have expect pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
lastly i feel that bose the speakers were over priced for what i the price of got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
it is to use and easy easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the the lack of rumors relieved to know i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
is looking for so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also cheap anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along with used in a boat a sub	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
the remote is the keyboard flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item having to carry since to carry around it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being very difficult to play and plagued afflicted by a number of glitches	0
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1

due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just lack of support for whs upnp guest network i was very unimpresse dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
even better with the on the go optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
the often problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
it is easy	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
i quite impressed ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1

the volume	0
this player is an ideal purchase	1
easy to use with the installation clear instructions contained in the install drive	1

this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
i get is fine to chapter and everything freezes	1

i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
yes the picture quality and features which very good are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
the eax features are well as other noise cancelling features are also pretty cool as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a ca pretty cool other features such as noise cancellation as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod ipod nano	0
files audio is excellent	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
also the computer player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0

my only complaint is that the cord list is not long enough	0
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size are good there is the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps expect even better than expected rrb	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
canon is optics are better and i believe think that their processing algorithms are also better	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
the resolution is very good and the colors vibrant are bright and even changeable	1
storage capacity	1
is amazing and the ability the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1

a big deal equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
all nice and compact	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the price for the money	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control the main scree are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp the characters it only shows the names of characters s with really long names you must cycl s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
not a good idea as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if gear in the case you load up all your songs beforehand	0
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that one of the reasons it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make adjust that big of a disturbance	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1

i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are the images are very sharp and thanks quite impressive	1
but the sound is very good sound quality and works well on my portable speakers	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i tried have called apex cust service no help	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
an all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
best camera ever that this camera does from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1

overall i like i think it	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
t is which does at all on not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on camera settings and this camera	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0

i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i love being the storage in this thing	1
