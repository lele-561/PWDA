after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
amazon was wonderful about picking up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
i have had problem what so ever with this product	0
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0

they are not	0
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can	1
is best i have used to date	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but waiting to go back to the store so i never got far to try this	0
the first routers worked good for years	1
other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
this is an excellent value	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0

great	1
the explorer program did shut down couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0

did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
the scene mode works well for the of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality i am getting from this g and easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto settings provide excellent photos if you nt want to bother with the settings	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
on the positive side is good once you have everything configured	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and headphone jack has already come loose	0
it has a nice color screen	1

anyways to the point i ve tried to be so calm the past month of dealing with and their terrible service and support	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
also sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can be annoying	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0

the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1

the main problems for me is that dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would a stars but i m giving because i they do the job that most people want them for	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0

without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i looked into inexpensive player that had than standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
i had this for months now and i	0
i have stored around cd is on this and barely touched	1
is beautiful	1
its to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
no propietary headset jack	0
nikon i the best camera out there for the features and price	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times zooms gets you just that much closer	1
the works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think would have been with the ipod as well	0
the end of the day what wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the range is so can blast it if you want	1
tech apex literally nonexistent	0
you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised how well this baby runs	1
this did nt bother me too much because is still a decent size	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings and am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was of the router	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the us and mortar they both delivered great results	1
great speakers overall	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1

the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
navigation could be better but is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable it	0
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
is easily but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
what a disappointment	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my ipod nano	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
slr like programming and gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1

you can do different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
user replaceable battery	1
this router is phenomenal	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
this is an excellent value	1
wonderful about picking up the next day paying for return shipping	1
however since i am in an office i keep them at a pretty low volume at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i have no complaints	1
both are very easy to learn use intuitive enough for even a novice	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone earpiece	1
it and has a nice dense feel to it	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level this phone is especially	1
surprisingly everything seems work well	1

creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds i bought the zen and guess what	0

the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0

the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
the lcd is larger than the model the nx and has a bright backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1

the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0

with mediasource being so easy i found no use the bundled nomad explorer software	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0

weaknesses are minor the feel and of the remote control are only so so it does show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting getting back normal size	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we we bought this router for our two computers	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
i nt had time to push this player the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory should be expected from creative labs	0

the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
t which does not work along several long stretches on same route	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
its ability to as a back up for my music collection is huge plus	1
all other pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1

however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
the first routers worked good years	1
also i can t understand why the does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the fm radio is cool	1
color and contrast	1
lcd screen was very large and readable	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for a small unit	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
be for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
compact and portable just as described great sound quality	1
overall an excellent phone	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1

without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound as the on stage and are truly portable lrb can played without power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
at am i called it quits and will be sending	0
the keyboard is also very nice and although it does take some getting	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image normal	1
is working just fine	1

the that came with it did nt fit very	0
chic look and good build the player comes a metal face plate	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1

battery life is very good i use it every day i have to charge it every or or so	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
to my ears kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked and will not do anything now	0
the rate plans also very good at least for me	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
it is mac	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
i that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make movies that way if you wanted to	1

but i already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me necessary	1
it is easy for to use but has features that photographers will love so it is an excellent camera	1

creative are the sound people for computers i can eax would introduce static	0
price gb of storage	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0

i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to through the quickly	1

user replaceable battery	1
i with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
the design and construction are excellent as is legendary quality of the nikon optics	1

but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
very simple to use	1
could be better but there nt really the zen xtra t once ve gotten comfortable with it	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
both the and white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
color screen is good	1
was very large and	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
i it up only produced a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0

the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
i have been disappointed find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information	0
ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb and with no extra shipping costs was at my door in chicago by got home from work tuesday	1
i know this unit will have problems in future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be it since will warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume loud enough at	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
for the price and features is really good	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
fact is it could be easier to use	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i love this player	1
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
it makes for this by being extremely easy to with well laid out controls that can be	1
both the black and the white speakers are and worth it	1
does not player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you is a good sound in a small package	1
the price of theese speakers the sound out	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
the interface software itself which should was anything but easy to use	0
brightness is easy four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel it	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
i m pleased with my zx here is a quick review	1
it would either not play the at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting my desk	0
for specific location i still think its a great phone	1
while the ease of use i put off by the price about more than i paid amazon for this player	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
the labeling of firmware itself mystery and suggests that this company is just	0
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0

speakerphone	1
they sound wonderful in my have nt even touched any equalizers	1
battery life is ok	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
mid range is nt best but it is certainly there enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
it surpasses greatest expectations a mp	1
it was the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	0
in it caused hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
i limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual with pictures so i am very pleased	1
you have to press hard and i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
other than that thing	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it work when it did not work one time before	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
video output stopped	0
yes there a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this engineered it that way minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
my other gripe is the remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
great speakers overall	1
these monitors are great for the price	1
that is a rare and valuable	1
i a little disappointed in the low end	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
broke after a month	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you	0
the picturers are amazing	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
the slim design	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
is a tad boomy and s o w it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down it all right are computer speakers	0
in fact it caused my system hang more times not so i uninstalled it stuck with mediasource	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing up	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can almost everything you at it	1
i could tell this a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
however for a budget i this camera is an excellent choice	1
it had a more sturdy	0
i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr cds	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the sound is excellent one would suspect from a creative product	1

they are not wowable good	0

selected it because it looked easy to install	1
first of all the is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0

although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the setup process for the nomad and the interface with the player is sub par	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots are not going to be in a regular setting	0

the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
it stands now the case is pretty useless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs	0
wow this speaker really	1
my blu ray player and live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform forever thereafter	1
