that is a rare and valuable feature	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vhs vcd that i ripped years ago and i ve never heard of that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
also it was very easy to set up a route on my new netgear as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing i love this app it files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
it is small	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
awesome system	1
but then again the ringer can be that i heard ringing inside my office when i already out on the street	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the sound pretty good also lrb although not anything a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
i simply love this feature	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i by feel alone actually gripping it and turning it am	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor is are very good provided that your subject shots no more than about feet away	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1

this is extemely lame	0
are not wowable good	0
the service from the airport was exceptional	1

canon is does it consistently g	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
even setting the volume to max and leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
the battery life this is amazing	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
it great to switch to spot metering see it on the lcd screen	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for the first time was under minutes	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are they are not quite as good as they used to be not quite as good as mm	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to get it to work and i had to be patient as i was used to just detecting the player and dragging and dropping my mouse into it	0
you ll be changing in this cd track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
best tech support i mbrojtjes	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say have success rate find it so frustrating that they just the device	0
the eax mode that keeps n song is a great feature that the volume at rides the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
full spectrum sound from full base to full range	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
nice and all	1
is mediasource an application with serious user interface flaws	0
overall i like the system features and performance	1
bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel combos and many of the user friendly functions very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
the catch with the canon g camera is its that unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
everything seems to work well	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts an excellent user interface with a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
found i after using it the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
the difference in the colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be than using windows explorer	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the right side of the screen kept going	0
i really love this netbook	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on hard to use off key is small and difficult to press	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
is no grill to any protection to the driver	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and some rubber put on the corners	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
i guess that limited take warranty means it may lifetime a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
no propietary headset jack	0
the prints are available	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0

i have one complaint only and that is the mb card included	0
the eax features are designed to be useful as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the noise and vibration encountered in a car or on a train	0
audio is excellent	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
first the sound quality is okay but after can cause audio interference the eax about minutes	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no way to use on the fly playlist creation such as with the ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with your phone number or phone numbers address books ect like the ip	0
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with than any other computer speakers ve owned	1

when you put this phone in pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	0
i three batteries to keep myself going with the s but battery in the g is a powerhouse	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
it surpasses greatest expectations a mp	1
slr programming and exposure control you latitude to be creative yet exposure settings excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
battery life the drawback quote most digital cameras to to k reeves	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1

i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
just an example of a user getting good value in this product	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than adequate for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
it has a nice color screen	1

the price took a chance with this new product and am pleased half of what i paid in six months it will cost except but that is i for current state of the art	1

this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and trying to find a way suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0

i bought my canon and a half ago g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next because months pointed out other reviewers have as the construction is pretty flimsy	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1

this machine will change your life and your idea of what a laptop should be	1
i use of for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job it	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
the design of the phone is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the door	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very scene mode offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset	1
mp x optical easy takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all is the above mp cameras zoom to understand and use a lot of features but add on options comes with great software and last and by far not least received my fiance of stamp of approval	1
i got this is a great gift and it for christmas	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
i pc spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do my pc nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
upon opening these i found them to be but a solid to them	1
my overall experience company with this monitor was very poor	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and modes	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
it has unproven battery life	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
a little but weighty otherwise fine	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1

received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
way less expensive than alternatives the ipod	1
it comes as a free app with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	0
my dad also hd has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
when the next version of the dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
anyways to the point i ve tried to be so calm the past month of dealing with and their terrible service and support	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
i purchased the nomad for about jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
i paired this two to very easily different android phones	1
both the black and the white versions are available and are economically priced and worth it	1
i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
i wake up and everything freezes	0
i have a problem with this mp player	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
software is easy to use	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	1
only thing missing from is creative a cd burner	0
it was very easy	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers good battery life multiple play modes	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
but if you re looking for my opinion can vouch for it of the apex dvd player i love it	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
the quality is excellent	1
it also has a very nice calculator built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
the first one we installed did nt work and didnt work our kids were devastated to say the least	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
for me its perfect the and quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
and the sound quality is very good there is no complaints about that	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
not want to have to buy a new one and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchase i did nt want one in which i would have want to buy another one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the auto mode is a nice touch but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i ve awful the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it but top of a portable radio on was tried trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
are the reception and sound quality top notch	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
is staggering the memory	1
great price for all the features	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
this is a directory for music and data storage	0
a small book with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
they caused the failed ie wrong product software the box the service tech problem to believe what the in said was wrong	0
huge storage space i loaded and of music which is nt that much songs my entire collection still have gb out of the provided to you	1
there is much about has been said in other reviews great the features of this phone it is a which phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
the main problems for me is that the distance from the sub to the control station is too short	0
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
this is one of the nicest phones one nokia has made	1
it can be up to about feet away from it and you will still work perfectly	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
no one sells a mm x mm is sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
lots of options and it has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
kidding was nt billy joel when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
and the screen freezes less than a month later eventually shows no disc	0
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
the storage capacity is great	1
the problem with this box is that it has to be opened several times an hour if not more frequently	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are lost	0
i book from amazon just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
is good	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
i am very proud of this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying display player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is enabled player is library	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday car out for rides	1
i have it on had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only turn on the microphone and the speakerboom feature once the person you are talking to answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
these speakers are these guys incredibly amazing	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and most intuitive remote control controls i have ever seen or used	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
the ringtones included were and did i mention they are awesome polyphonic	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on in the shower my night stand	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
well this speaker does the thing and is perfect same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
monitor easy to up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
the door would not close	0
first the zen lets you sync to connect your computer more than one computer	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
i needed the battery to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
very i am overall satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
i will never buy a creative writing book again	0
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
i chose would recommend this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
i got this thing for christmas i have been very with it ever since	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca of nt be beat	1
so i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware atdd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
it is a great phone if are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be heard	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
the zen xtra s great with good headphone and well recored mp sounds	1
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
great price for this product	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
look fantastic they	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is also better what i have	1
it a type is made of plastic	0
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality the not even using and best possible as setting yet	1
the speaker phone in the car very functional and i use it is very audible even with freeway noise	1
it has a nice color screen	1
market the grain was terrible	0
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
very convenient to scroll in menu bar	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player one of the best on the market	1
it is a fantastic and well worth the price	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
oops i forgot to go online and adjust it there	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
very happy and all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones to your phone from www crazycellphone com	1
although the phone is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was designed to do and what it is meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
found nearly pictures i have after that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
ooh works fine i dropped it and all still and this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to it of them yet	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and started ad lasted about a week and a half act it the to before up	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a quality camera that takes great pictures yet would be easy to use and does nt take weeks to figure out how to operat good digital camera that takes great pictures yet would highly does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
is excellent image quality the	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and they said if i get timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
this phone is a winner	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not to be a regular setting	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
this is awesome thing is trash	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has i cant tell if been around mb s even when in the same room	0
i found it very useful as a tool for transferring large files to another computer	1
a i have had no problems with the phone	1
and everything are great	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
the monitors were both good	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
color screen is good	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality netgear products service that i would never recommend customer to anyone i know	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
placed on the screen again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
they re pretty comfortable to sit in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and still it would nt work	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just there	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i had no problem using already software musicmatch on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
what a sweet machine	1
i have tried many times to get a hold apex who does nt seem to their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one customer service is probably extremely overworked	0
my only complaint to date is that it does not allow me to change the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt want to do that i dont know if it was because of something that i did or if it	0
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
i ve been using numerous different monitor models since i m a kid and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
i checked out the m amazon and i reviews pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
great value gb gb vs ipod for the price	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main the on why i picked factors nomad	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
best without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
this size small speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
in addition it only seems work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
i would not be inclined to purchase it again	0
there is no way the battery supplied lasts that long	0
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
and amazon com has it for such a great how can you go wrong	1
looking you re if for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end with search your the nikon	1
the phone is is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss my is voice dialing	1
there is no way that long the battery supplied lasts hours	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried was trying to make i have to be so calm over the past month i want to get of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the rest of the process so i dont think it was a problem	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
for the first few weeks this dvd player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi media player it is a great dvd players with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
beautiful home theater and music crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
also it was only with free shipping and it was a good price so overall it is a decent player	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
very compact and portable just as it should be with great sound quality	1
this has happened with a lot of different things and i dont know what it is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
frame freezes and the family dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this list to be quite disturbing	0
even with these shortcomings i still think best is the it digital camera available under	0
bottom line good for the price these things sound great and have tons of is bass	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
the player has its minor glitches like sometimes when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my likings	0
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time i have mentioned	0
it is easy enough for grandmother my to use	1
this phone is one of radio the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
it is light extremely and dissapears in your pocket	1
it has a beautiful design lots easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery is amazing	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the pictures are pretty good even in macro	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and more	1
no problem is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal this	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
so out if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
i took with this new product and pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid that is the price current of the art	1
for those who want this is not the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year not be worth it since it will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou no questions asked replacement warranty will most part the no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since i am sure the warranty will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the controls on the player are very simple for a manual	0
and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects are not a good sign this router i kills it for me due to poor quality no doubt rrb an paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb deal on this price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects are not a good sign this router i kills it for me	0
once is great since the replacable battery it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most not seem to have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally use firewire cards themselve windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given the quality its features and specifications	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a good sound system with both internal and external speakers	1
the device is small and well designed i would recommend it	1
were both good the monitors	1
found i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
also you can nt is which data on it a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do store bother this is a much better buy	1
it looked just right	1
thuumbs up to acer widescreen k monitor	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar and they delivered great results	1
bass fanatics look at the s s	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i t	0
depends sound is awesome but if u put it too loud the on yoursound quality the sound might crack	0
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality great battery life great hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused it to occasionally not turn on	0
after using it i in a pocket the size to be perfect for carrying found	0
failed the software repeatedly	0
if you re this for a quality tower speaker looking is it	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
received apex dvd and the picture was good even when set up with s connector	1
update the finish is i think more mirror than silver and i like it	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
the color screen is as are the polyphonic ringtones	0
uploading the images this to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
but this camera better is great	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today for the price	1
in short if you and just this router that is a little afraid of technology re you just get online a router to want do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day someone is great for you	0
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it not really appropriate to rate it based on in a different class	1
it is crystal clear	1
i i d buy another	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
broke after a month	0
picture quality is excellent	1
seems like a good product	1
i think im glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase over of zennx ipod	1
not it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems trying to find a way to get to do only slightly better	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the sound quality are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are using the zen software but i was using musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
because this camera sucks	0
excellent range of products as well	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from image quality from a technical camera a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i like the the shape size and weight of this little critter	1
it energy is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
without a doubt i have to say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated say to the least	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
in other words the zen is not it if a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need collection for your music collection	0
it a little bigger than the ipod not by much	0
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
well the theory was but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already created you will have to do it manually and transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the player has firmware which will remove memory leaks the glitches if there are any	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me is many to complained that the wheel however cumbersome and difficult have operate	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have twice a week to charge it every or days or so	1
when i tried to install the in dvd player second my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
the picturers are amazing	1
the person on the other end the call can hear you perfectly	1
main dial is not backlit	0
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
the other day when i was listening to a came on and i just stopped song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
i am enjoying my phone	1
it well was nice while it lasted	1
i ve had it for about a year now and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
the scroll bar a pain is a bit of a pain	0
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance on their own or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging full of music a cd case to work to the gym around with me in the car etc	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
in fact the of my creative mp players had software problem in each first place	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
i m not the type of person who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	0
also it has unproven battery life	0
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
nice little phone light compact	1
after seeing listening to and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
i m setting it would and can different useful in a be sure one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was and disconnect from my fios optical network when i tried to connect to it that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical d link service failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed fro network block	1
was	1
first i ll start off by players that this saying hardware is pretty good	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the is awesome	1
guys these speakers are great	1
the same title as on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
i with the results am very pleased with it so far	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
great camera	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
it is than smaller i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the lcd screen was it very large and readable	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
downloading music files is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq a limited band eq	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
it is well packaged	1
you have to press the buttons hard and fast to scroll so i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even though it is nt and force you to tell it that it is a new computer and it is authorized	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t beat it	1
within a year there the last week are problems with my menu dial knob	0
i can to anyone recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also you as a radio which is a nice feature when doubles are bored	1
might the price and specs this considering be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get think this is the best dvd player you can get for the pric for the price	1
battery is nice	1
i bought this a couple months ago from computer direct monitor and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
i tried to play with no success three times the song	0
this like does drop every once in a while but not router the old router did every hour or so	0
however shareport on this new router worked of is disabled most the time	0
buttons do are a little small so the connector might be a proble seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
finally rating reiterate my thumbs down i for t mobile as a carrier	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for thing i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyt processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price found both i	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i old with my did front speakers	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell to it	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
blown out highlights ve been bothered by i on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library does work with mp s the goes on and on	0
i just had to suck it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
with my sennheiser headphones at is loud enough the volume	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
this thing is i like to it to pick up and also to	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
i but nt go into the details go as the online camera here into great depth in their reviews wo i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this sites offers	1
it would spin read spin some more and would read read read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no dis then show on the display that there was no disc	0
this is my time using the second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do not need to worry about it the ability to delete pics that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
my only complaint is like it it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when others here it because does does it so often	0
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
easy how to hook up	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
made call which friendly and was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either nas or print server	1
black and white balance	1
understand i can t also why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
easy to use the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
that canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has to use auto mode the makes it very easy for the novice an	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight balance of size to it	1
a replacement is this machine for your desktop	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
i bought this set it up and tried would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
finding a on song or album particular the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
anyway this player is a great one and i really love it	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the software is sucks	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
this feature simply love i	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently standard than with lower speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
price of storage	1
kind of bulky is awkward the wheel and but i can deal with that	0
i bought this monitor from computer direct bought a couple months ago and i have been very happy satisfied with it so far	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
bought the gb xtra of couple a weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating a as for t mobile carrier	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing editing of id tags	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
i use this with a home have been using theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
plusses are the battery the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
also i can t understand why the site does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
p it is not lite on weight so it is a bit heavy but i definately recommend it to anyone out there	1
this is the best dvd ever seen player i ve purchased	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
this wonderful to for your first dvd player	1
bottom line well made easy to use very and powerful to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
for the it price is a well spent investment	1
i would nt mind having floor external adjustable antenna but it house fine as is and the speed on the bottom an of the does is much improved	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the speakerphone the radio work perfectly all features	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option and the fact that it has calling and texting capabilities and access to my corporate email	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
it is easy enough are currently to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and this that suggests company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
the player like its minor glitches has for example when i turn which on percent of the time it sais shutting down it means i have to turn which and turn it on again off is not to my likings	0
the color screen makes this phone after rebates free shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
they look fantastic	1
anything this phone does it perfectly	1
it is versatile and has the potential to be one of the best	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
first of all the player is sound quality and the sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
get to chapter and everything freezes	0
after months it playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
the is okayed appearance	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
it s not all about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality and clean images	1
the pictures daylight pictures are brilliant and night and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
however you do it you get what you pay for in reliable products	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
can t beat carrying cd with me collection wherever i go	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
do nt buy this player	0
excellent takes photos	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was can hear can hear already out on the street	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
however get does not play windows media and i can not it it to play any of my divx rips	0
picture poor quality is excellent	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
can works and looks great if you player get the dvd is to play	1
the insult is that while this router comes useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the software from the internet then pay an to unlock all the features	1
ring tones only come with crazy one ring that sounds close to a regular ringwith all the ringtones with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one round that sounds similar to a normal rin songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
games kind of stink and you ca download them you have get the link cable to get additional games	0
i just got my new phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has a lot of features for me to grow into	1
it may came well packaged	1
features great	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
audio is excellent	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was free	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
i love my new nomad job and its great	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate would get you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line about half out jack	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
this is a very a little less than oz phone light with long battery life	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish the you best and hope my review helped	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
the other controls all very easy to use	1
i got this for use on my truck m for the most part it loud however you are going to want for i	0
and really this is the best phone one can buy	1
the remote is flimsy feeling use and awkward to use	0
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
but i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the price is very good	1
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
i just purchased this phone coolest i think this is the and phone i ever had	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work again and again when it did not work one time before	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
color and contrast are just right for my needs	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
second the automatic sync on creative your iphone lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
this is not worth any price and recommend you	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
the battery is nice	1
when it works its fine two of them but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
this the battery life is amazing	1
i on this phone the lack of entertaining games find quite disturbing	0
mac is so small but big value it	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
to are much more distinct squint i do nt have to strain my eyes and and when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had things do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
i started accessing downloading and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as it was on the same as my old netgear	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re going to be loading packing the player up for travel or if that it s not worth it you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the light is awesome correction auto	1
use this product is too fragile for normal use	0
color screen is good	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
the earbuds included were uncomfortable	0
overall i like the unit	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
the keyboard connector upgrading the memory while broke	0
the software mediasource can not work on my computer	0
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
the sound is excellent the sound quality is excellent the battery life is good the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod nano	1
all other buttons are work pretty pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that the driver was a problem installing there	0
my other gripe than the incredibly crappy remote which is worse is other cheaper apex units	0
linux has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
maybe it is my lack of experience with digital cameras but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when rrb on my laptop i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
at ounces is pretty light but as the ipod	1
bookmarks are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
one other issue is that the jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone is a great phone and i think will not break easily like typical american phones	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
very long lasting battery life	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
this phone a winner is	1
great good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
battery life is good although recommend i two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
in camera summary i love this quality camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
has so many capabilities that you ll always have as they evolve	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
do nt buy this monitor	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
ripping and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
having access to so much music where ever you the opportunity to listen go is terrific	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
price	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the quality of the nikon optics	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered it would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it as well will play mpeg hard disk i also found that i files on a regular cd by accident that it as well will play mpeg hard disk i also found that i files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
tech support was very pleasent and easy to deal with once you actually got someone	1
great camera great investment	1
those used to mm cameras will to the g very comfortable and friendly find use	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you and will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	0
great quality of life and features	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to the elements protect it against any damage	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
it works during flawlessly installation of cx	1
it is lighter to carry around enough it has and functionality to use	1
acer has awful to deal with they treat their customers like and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
for the apex money machines have good features	1
some features in the user interface	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
avoid this like the plague	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the player i ve seen and used ever	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
it also views of the city has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend to it anyone out there	0
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
the sound quality is	1
pros huge storage capacity for the and cons good value price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast ratio brightness contrast ratio and viewing angles	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner my basement	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit very easy to set up is located on the top floor rrb and way it is set up very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
bottom line it did line is that nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
do nt buy a car	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to have to pay for this great player	1
as stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your	0
but with higher prices comes lower quality	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
however the main reason i am not too impressed with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
i could tell this was going to work as soon as i set it up	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
there are lots of interesting features in the app such as eax and customization	1

support from is literally nonexistent	0
the color is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1

the instructions that come with it use it do nt explain how to make things simple	0

if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
without ever any tweaking at all if the exposure is and the colors accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
very good value for the money money	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard hard to turn so you can for the dial t get an accurate adjustment	0
item do nt buy this monitor	0
had a jvc system that was years old better and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1

it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1

the format matter no	0
the subwoofer has a great sound and gets really high	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
quite bulky and uses as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful device	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
and if you do well there is no complaints about that	1
lastly i feel that bose the speakers were over priced for what i the price of got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
i like this player	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical chance american phones	1
first of all the player quality and the sound quality is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0

you irreversible nt that upgrade is ca	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0

i am is to savy with a computer but the d link not very easy to install and set up	0
i m this monitor for a month now and i have very pleased with it	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the reviewer got me to buy was what that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
or is great upstairs downstairs outside the range in a basement four bars all the time	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
it has the radio of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and lots	1

even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
i think real the reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
setup software for my application i found found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
its silver magnesium finish is a nice touch and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
now when the backlight fails leave have to i it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
mr trump is trash	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only the shutter it trigger does it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1

a week out of the box and i began to see frequent contractions of the screen from time to time growing more slight each day	0
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1

the the software problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is main	0
for my birthday i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
i was really impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though this was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1

i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1

i am using them in my office and they generally seem to be very good	1
changing the brightness is brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
however if speed reliability and power to to connect to the internet transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
ve been using the for about six weeks and it proven itself be all that it is advertised	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
the dell phablet i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
is zoom x nice	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack which is what it was for me and many others	0
well backlit keypad	1

pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1

possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this apex model will work not work with my universal remote control	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
are the picturers amazing	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
poor visibility on the keys	0

however the intuitive software is not real creative	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
i know this unit i think will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days be worth the money and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will been worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1

i highly recommend it	1
the windows premium is very good and the lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1

after about an hour it starts skipping like it is are doing	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings at the range of choices i have there too	1
the computer used for data processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the software mastered quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily is	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software was wrong	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0

the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
however some of the in bandwidth hogging software far too often starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer was latest order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
sound quality is good	1
however since i am in an office i keep them at a pretty low volume at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
delivery was prompt	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
my first impression was positive	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
you can settings manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
its fast forward and rewind work much models smoothly and consistently than those of other more i ve had	1
it may	1
your hand still fits in the palm of it and it is not heavy	1
i have and installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that was a problem installing the driver	0

much luck with also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
crystal clear is sound and the bass is very deep as well	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
the sound is excellent one would suspect from a creative product	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the ks which are not listed but are listed tracks are listed individually and are organized by alphabetical order can be difficult because the cd which are listed separately and are ordered by the kd individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
in all i d say that this is a decent router for the money	1
when the screen was very good nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
the optical zoom works great and the x zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
when i got it home i that the options sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0

all sorts of problems has the player itself	0
no fm or voice recording have been nice extras would these	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants to buy wants one now	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to charge the camera while plugged in so you dont have to worry about	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
third the poor mans lawyer continues with the case	0
these speakers are great	1
you can manage your profile change make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is very useful as you can get different variations with it	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
a lot the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as is supposed straight out of the box	0
the infrared is a blessing if you have want and to a previous nokia transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
the sound quality is very good	1
the size is small	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
the setup process for the nomad and the interface with the player is sub par	0
the usb port the back on is a nice feature	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
the be installed software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
is nice the battery	1
turned this apex dvd player well out great	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to be able to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
after hooking the thing up would found that it i only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
these monitors are great for the price	1
however my hard drive fail and i not dropped it once	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day a mah battery without worrying about charging	1
my immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of i favorite dvds	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i home tuesday	1
this dvd play is full of junk	0
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months took me to get through to their customer service dept	0
i find this to be a great feature	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
very convenient to scroll in menu bar etc	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu to select them by using the number keypad	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line the other hand was very helpful	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
the price is very good	1
exceedingly simple is it to navigate around in this device	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is too small and does not work well	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it really annoying when it does because does it so often	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
digital cameras have made the g the best bargain in recent price drops currently available	1
buy a high quality scan player for a relatively low price	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing a thumbs up for great sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
perhaps the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the player can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
for a small portable this allows you to listen to as well as share music and podcasts in intimate setting	1
is looking for so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also cheap anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	0
very good range and seemed to be it seems better in the horizontal position	1
the features are really cool too	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
simply the canon eos d mark ii is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my when using my home wireless router home broadband cable modem as input	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
both are very learn use to easy and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
i was acer that dissapointed was nt more helpful	0
earpiece is and easy to use	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommend it to anyone in the canon for picture quality	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can for expected be the mind specifications keep in machine i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion a to comes lot of people	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1

but if you ve used a slr very camera the controls are mm intuitive	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0

i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
also has a nice guest link so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
these monitors are great for the price	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
that came with the router did with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had not work and to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0

the volume range is great so blast can you it if you want	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
i m delighted with this product	1

the grain was terrible	0

the second set rest of the is working just fine	1
the black fly wheel too feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the fact that there is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1

nice and compact	1
my friends were impressed with the the of quality pictures i took	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1

too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
it full hd has a nice color screen	1
the excels thank a cell phone as god	1
the movie clips taken probably will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
an excellent feature for example are bookmarks but not on this player	0
but anyway the only thing you should have voice dialing look at here is the fact that the phone does really	1
sound exceptional though i can t really put my finger on it to the ipod	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
the zen stores be files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened data programs to or launched from its disk	0

my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
the sound quality is very good	1
screen brightness is really good	1
is great i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
creative are the sound people static i can t understand why eax would introduce for computers	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for anyone to use even if a novice	1
the excels as a phone cell thank god	1
all the buttons neccessary lil buttons and all the gadgets are on the sides of the your hand player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
months of use and it no works longer recognizes anything	0
i have nt had time really push player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as be expected from creative labs	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
it really didnt bother me with the disign the specs the price	0
your health is fine	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
volume level	1
apex is an application for dvd players	0
the apex has been a steady performer for a turning point me	1
with this mp player you get much more memory can get for much less than an ipod	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
the ihome stereo reproduction clearly superior	1
cheap rubber they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some construction on the corners	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for	0
it has all features the one would need in a cellphone	1
i m not over dollars to accept shoddy construction on something i paid willing for	0
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
it came back working and i was turn in that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt momentarily out to be true glad my case	1

the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for last couple to i have had it	1
the player is mechanics are good but flawed	0

the day arrived when i was sure d leave sprint	0
portable	1
love this feature simply i	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now on playing interface you a lot of things can see the interface as modern or classical	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see screen and if button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
the price performance looked just right	1
the team is top notch	1
the pc side software it be goofy and takes a little getting used to but can is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
in all i d say the price this is a decent router for the money	1
the software is very buggy and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
the system was near stable and the code was alpha stage at best	1
what picture the hell is wrong with this thing	0
the manual does a fine job filling any in blanks that remain	1
i ve sent an e mail to their customer service department requesting an explanation of the issue with no response	0
i bought this slick and i am very happy with it	1
it stock tracking has a also app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
it does tend to run hot and be given lots room for air circulation	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who have been looking for a new mp player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
they are clears with other products and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
my wife is even more pleased with it due to its widescreen	1
the only two minor issues i have with the lens and the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0

navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
rw ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r apex and dvd r rw	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
in fact to caused my system it hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
speed switch negotiated the the just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make adjust that big of a disturbance	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
it is versatile seems to be one of the	1
here made out of metal and is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
great by phone	1
screen the is large and easily read	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
a good dvd player this is for the most part	1
it and is easy to use it seems feature complete	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my computer but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
the is good but interface used could be better designed	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention were polyphonic	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
for instance ups made several back i of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
huge storage space that many i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have for your music gb out of the provided to you	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox faster to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
you ca nt go wrong if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
it came back working and i was momentarily my that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be case in glad true	1
the quality is superb	1
i have been ripping weeks into it for the past few songs and the ease of use is wonderful	1
it was easy enough to get the battery out of the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
this software is absolutely terrible	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
was very easy setup	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is of the device prone to popping off	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to see how it would feel in my hand i listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than can use it the s	0

the second part of the puzzle is working just fine	1
however when i plugged it into my laptop mini the screen looked wonderful	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
it has many great features bad very few and ones	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would try again have to restart the router then get going again	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load a bit on some computers	0
i am bored it with the silver look	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
material is on the cheap side	0
the too small storage capacity is great for me	0
however a phone call to the d link support crew was in a reasonable amount of and guided me through the process without a problem	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and control	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price use about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1

i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0

my only beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
range was comparable to even or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting do not have this feature is the jukebox player which included in the standard jukeboxes that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	0

technical support rude and unhelpful	0
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with it	1

the canon g gives the average person tons of control for photo buffs easy to use but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even heard of any equalizers	1

despite its being smaller than the ipod i have i have to say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1

the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
i have of yet seen any not the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
silverish color really touch adds a special touch	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
despite cant say the same most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0

i love my new nomad its great	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of on the the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
i highly recommend a dont nokia	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
mid range speakers but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone looking not to spend on computer is nt the best	0
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
you a button can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene button that can be used to adjust the focus that would be really helpful if shooting a scene tha with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tomatically focus with the push of a button and it ha tough to automatically focus	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for the price	1
for the price it is worth	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the only things book i have found that i in the dark it have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
excellent phone the phone looks better than what u see in the pictures	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
great phone i d buy now	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
besides i widescreen monitors hate	0
i started accessing transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
i find pretty easy to use unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind as long as i am notmad	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and can be applied to many situations in which i would actually want to use the camera	1
have had the player since xmass love it and	1
the world is borderuer lcd scoying	0
seemed like a good deal but this frequently can not recognize dvds and takes a long time loading and then no disc	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
the sound this slim design puts out	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
this is by far the finest camera its price and category in i have ever used	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1

a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
and will read it play all cd audio disc	1
great speakers overall	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
if you have netbook expectations will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1

this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
the game itself is pretty solid	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
easy enough but did not work	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
the pictures are so amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the with the iphone earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
got a update that fixed the system error problem days after purchase	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills coffee on the floor my beer but does nt wash my car	1
getting access to the device is so easy	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these for myself	1
x zoom is nice	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
i usually avoid horns but i nt hear anything overly extreme	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled with the system is mind blowing	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
this thing great	1
it would just spin up stop and display no disc	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put so much effort and quality into the g	1
sucks the software	0
even reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
other than that the picture is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the sound quality is very good the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
it is small overall bigger than not necessarily inferior ipod but keep in mind the this is because different less expensive but that technology is used in the zx	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
their network coverage is very poor and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
their network coverage is very sporadic the network always resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
the device is small and well designed i think	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
is an excellent value this	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
picture is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i take asked to was a the camera of a vacationing elderly group	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
i of this little critter the size and weight like	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
definitely more than of filling the room with sound capable any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
i the manual followed the easy instructions in the manual and once have online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily accessible	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
some movies it played yesterday it played today	1
it is lighter to carry around than a laptop and it has enough functionality to use	1
good luck life	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i had ever seen i made the purchase	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
would nt buy of because again the customer service	0
i turned the phone on the first thing that hit how good the screen is	1
love it i seriously	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but enough so it does nt you when you stare too long	1
is a very durable compact package and i find to be a brand that i can trust	1
due to the lack of features and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
been replaced by the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this morning i have an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
the customer support is very mr trump rude	0
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the sound that from that little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
it looks very cool and seems quite a bit of fun to me and very light	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
sound quality is my only significant complaint	0
the problem with zen is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products its a shame	0
but i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
unit is that the another nice thing has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the was latter not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
it a dvd r play did which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
we are well on our way with the monitor and the company	1
the second video was released about two weeks before the video went out	0
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
it through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk from transfer allows you to simply drag and drop files so windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
navigating through the menus is super easy going especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
now when the power to the computer fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
it still fits in palm of and it not heavy	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be the game but there are some things in a regular setting	1
you can see the top of the barrel in the view finder	1
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
hopless product hopeless company and reviews hopeless customer support	0
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially in the market at the the sound quality low price these sell for here on amazon	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t hear	0
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal loss	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
what disappointment a	0
b fast mediasource cd ripping for about seconds takes a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
but about of dvd picture i ve played on ithave a problem the picture a movie the watching will freeze but when dvd still plays and eventualy the is kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was not great	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is manual mode terrific for point and shoot	1
this is an ideal purchase	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
playing it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
was was dissapointed that acer i nt more helpful	0
tech support from apex is almost nonexistent	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are a lot better than any other camera i ve seen	1
and works great too it	1
i should ve all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
this thing is trash	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are quality of the screen bright and even changeable	1
because it help can a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i think this is great for me	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd ive ever seen and the best that i ve seen	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information update the lyrics is nt always accurate	0
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
feel and the plastic is feels like it would break very easily cheap it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic in the hand but seems pretty sturdy	1
it has a lot more features and costs a lot less than the ipod	1
for the is and features it price really good	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
this player is an ideal purchase	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
i found the controls intuitive very and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
this camera is worth every penny i and highly recommend it	1
this is by far the nicest one ive seen in so many ways	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
even the slightest of touches to your face totally distorts your image	0
but if you want mp and a great a great deal player get the nomad	1
the internal network still functioned but it could not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
nice to have them back but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
i love the storage in fact that im this thing	1
as a whole i think it has a sleek design and works fine	1
the results were both good	1
it is scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve heard nothing of the headphone jack hissing that people have repeatedly complained about and caused havoc over but as i m only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize of my favorite dvds two	0
nice little phone light compact	1
great features	1
oops easy to go online and i forgot adjust it there	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i was going to d leave sprint	0
for the price and features it is really good	1
it does not have an auto focus assist feature which is nice for taking photos in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in light but it is not as good as the sony	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
just a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds to my ears as good as a portable cd player	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to at my vista pc reboot least twice not fun	0
i try navigating using is player the built in menu and it still would nt work	0
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple overpriced ipod is	1
before asking for the zen xtra mp player i researched a few different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
battery life my life is ok	1
unfortunately the player not read any of though they were not damaged in any way	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the is great speakerphone is excellent	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is not included in the box is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
difficult navigation i wo nt mean to say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i have been calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the quality of the repair team of acer	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really much that the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten used to it and comfortable with it	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would a little more effort have been with the ipod as well	0
because of it is hidden i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon and its ability to bring enormous quality into the g	1
same story as everybody else when find a job trying to get service from apex nothing	0
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
player works and looks great past how hard it if you can get the dvd is to play	1
takes	1
easy to use a lot has mentioned about this of reviews	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
unfortunately it can t be play all of the dvd	0
but canon never he fails to amaze	1
unfortunately it turned out to be the disposable type	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
i it and treat the battery well has lasted	1
this is a great camera for you	1
its fast forward and rewind work much the other apps more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
i want nt do to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
only get one camera in it we could if	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
oh pretty sweet the screen saver feature is and	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have xbox one of the others are usualy moderate or strict when i called them they were very nice and tried th	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was slow but now its still really fast	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
simply this is what was created and was left behind	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i rate would give a stars but i m giving i would say that because i think they do the job that most people want them for	0
the sound quality is really good	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of size and features easily meets my needs	1
key instead	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to is very good your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound as the on stage and are truly portable lrb can played without power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
price gb of storage	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
however once you crank the volume up a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the sound quality is great lrb well this is the best i have heard for	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the storage capacity is great	1
does what sound should and the it seems fine to me	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
the backlight on the phone goes on and off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing life sound quality great features long battery good and an unbeatable price	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
the software	1
i ve now had really the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
positive the on side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
the in and out of i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
the player usually plays dvd is but has a few quirks such as not recognizing a movie as a dvd and stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental d	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all search engine of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
i wanted the product it just did nt	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
battery life is ok	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can camera but also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
and works great too	1
got a system error problem days after purchase	0

the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0

the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0

im sorry for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
i agree with the earlier agree reviewer angle and you need to adjust the brightness who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player busy not connected or either	0

as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1

i wished a little bit they could make the volumn that louder	0
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the my no matter how often reloaded rebooted device pc reset online device i drivers etc etc creative is the support was no help at all	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
it is it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1

this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them is always busy customer support telephone number after and they do not answer their web customer support	0

the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who serious about digital photography is	1
for ask for more of this product i could not the cost	0

its focusing system is also very flexible	1

i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does take up a lot of space the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
without having to go through all the trouble of going the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0

i ve also had the urge to do a zen lock up several times	0
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
i was surprised at how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
this model router has now failed me the system twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
the menu options are a bit confusing as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost outs sound fills the exceedingly well	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or as a file server print server	1
silverish color really adds a nice touch	1
screen visible bright	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the big backlight makes things easier to read and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
am impressed with this camera is to use	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting button with good the the screen is really big and the to light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy blue use after mastering the scroll things great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1

i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1

this is an excellent value	1
you can also assign special rings and numbers to your phone to special people when they call	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
the screen goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that can interfere with viewing at night its a shame	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get can get a lot more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
my first impression was positive	1
set wpa with problems	0

playlists can be made playing the fly without aid of a computer and you play modes use can like shuffle and repeat for your now on selections or playlists	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not been able to recover it	0
navigation is easy found and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i can t rate one it star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
sometimes the system would freeze up and shut down so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
it is easy for beginners to use grow into has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to but	1
i have over files in my head at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
i hope this is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
the rate plans are also very good at the moment least for me	1
technology wise i think this is awesome system makes plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0

the lack of support is very rude	0
i looking portability and good battery life and delivers both	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
i also like the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
see the detail in the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
after using it for about month can state unequivocably definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1

with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
i have to say that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
made is it of plastic	0
the bass is a tad boomy and s a l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
i ve also had lock nomad zen the up several times	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end bass as my old setup	1
i gave it only stars due to the that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
awesome sound system	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
excellent sound i found music the reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with a long zoom the zoom is very slow and you must cycle through every zoom setting before	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
seems like a good	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month and already it feels like i ve well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox fast and	0
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
the first routers worked for years	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
i have noticed that when i look at the same image day after day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when you look from the center to the corner	0

yes there a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this engineered it that way minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
this was standard shipping service	0
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel select to you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
not counting the time i spent editing trying to find the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
pros so i went to get a faster router and one did the job i bought it	0
height there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and library player is displaying	0
i personally like to see would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting external noise out	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks off and makes me want my beer but does nt wash my car	1
seems like a good good product	1
because this camera sucks is beautiful	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose a theme as of now you can choose the interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1

i like lock automatic key the function	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the features is great	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly with this camera boxy looking it the only issues needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
weaknesses are minor the feel the layout show and remote control are only so so it does nt with the complete filenames of mp s of really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0

the scroll bar is a travesty enough a pain said	0
wpa up set with no problems	1
i would nt having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this pleasantly baby runs	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
of course have some good customization options the unit as well	1

what a day	1
i d venture best pc stereo set out there cost wise to say that because right now of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
this it a great piece speaker system for a computer and is is worth every penny	1
and i love extremely low frequencies and low bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
this time actual link support was more helpful and guided me to from d problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed the my fios optical network block	1
this system is very powerful	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially stored in a folder called unknown	0
down scroll button switch	0

i find it pretty use to easy and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
only con i can think of is camera	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
i recommend unreservedly class the powershot g to first any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
also you can store data on it which nt have to worry abou is a plus for all you a great way to store your ipod data and people who want to buy an ipod just get rid of it if yo to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
my other big complaint is the stand about this monitor	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0

but if the nomad want a great deal and a great mp player get you	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d is on music the option to search for the player contained in a folder tag unavailable	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty it means may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
ripping mouse the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
conclusion bought them but i didnt want i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
with this mp player you get much more an ipod for much less than memory	1
the interface software itself which not only slow should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and expensive but the fact that they exist tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized video was poor and features not available	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a little camera so much	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one app the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on the with sound turned up	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat screen tv with such horrible viewing angles	0
camera great	1
unlike some of the other people who a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
unknown the size is small	1
when the photos took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving i were awesome	1
nice phone light compact	1
it is small	1
however the creative software is real intuitive	1
the connection is not reliable constantly dropped	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
people also have complained about the case having a window but that is not really to me either the case is sturdy offers very good	1
i do i but unforutnately like this phone overall am returning it	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
iso shutter the manual mode is a great option easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0

it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are not looking at it	0
great minds picture	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress me	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
it will only move tilt to side lrb no up down or the monitor side feature rrb	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i have always owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
this is an excellent player especially for features and features the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched by artist or album as it does not recognize folders	0
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and a lot of sweet tunes	1
the possibilities with auto focus and the very helpful scene mode which allows you to select optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
this product is amazing	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but i think this one really deserves five stars	1
i really have no control over this unit	0
the build quality feels or it does nt shake solid whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
are better is optics canon and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player one of is probably the best out there	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer deal and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized i t ringtones	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have it set up and everything configured	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video video was released went out	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
you re going to to need buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
the router recognized easily and further setup was a breeze	1
overall an excellent phone	1

the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
all in all it is very easy to use	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
you have to scroll to the bottom and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits in your hand and can fit into any pocket without falling out	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
i wished that they could make little a the volumn bit louder	0
other than that thing	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this is the first time i have easily met and surpassed my needs	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
the sound quality is really good	1
other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	0

yes the the features picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
this player is not worth any money and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
the catch with the precious camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss canon g shots	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1

sub woofer is large	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor on the market	1

i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1

contrary to a ive g elsewhere the read does sync at of what second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
i enthusiastically recommend this book camera	1

huge storage space even at kbs can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
this phone has many other features ir to name one the features above i view as most beneficial	0
no connection direct firewire to the camera	0
the price i paid was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1

the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there even are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
fact is could nt	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
however some of the bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
was good easy to read screen	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0

it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
it is slightly lighter than features and packed with even more the g	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
i have disappointed to find that there no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it help but to the ipod	1
best in class performance	1
the only of sight is the remote which requires a line downside	0
