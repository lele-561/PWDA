good looks	1
then my dvds would be lost forever or not even be read at all	0
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to use at all	1
bright visible light	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see on the screen such as modern or classical	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1

huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on your phone	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1

i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
the display is bright enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about any of the other issues	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
the big backlight makes it easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
sound quality is good	1
i think it too bright	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0

if you want to rename a cd to a cd that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0

this router does drop every once in a while but not as much as the old router did every hour or so	0
and with usb transferring files from your computer to your player is incredibly easy	1

my only complaint about the hardware is the buttons	0
for the cost of this service i could not ask for more	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1

definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
the man who looks like a work of art	1

typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0

the rate plans are also pretty good at least for me	1
the stock is on the cheap side	0
these are great bike speakers for the kids to use while cycling in the park	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
it works only during installation of the system	0
because this camera sucks	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
easy to set up	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1

the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
for the money apex machines have lost	0

this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
the remote is a little hard to find	0
the buttons and interface are very simple	1
it came well packaged	1
possibly the biggest advantage that this player has is the fact that she can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this router is the best router i have used to date	1
it is the most bang for your buck out there	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
view this screen	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1

i bought this dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a lot of different sites	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1

but for what i do use it is great	1
good battery life	1

sound exceptional though i can t really put my finger on it to the ipod	1
i selected the right away and have gotten a new set of pictures every time	1
living in a house with no windows the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
the speakerphone is great and all features work perfectly	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i took	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume of the speakers is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the price i was willing to pay for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the first one i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0

on dvds so i cant get it to work it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
this device is too fragile for normal use	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today for the price	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1

excellent battery life hours beats battery life	1
this is a toy and what a toy it is	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack which is what it was for me and many others	0
they have a whole bunch of them in the us that all have the same sounding name	0
kudos apple for your support your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
it also has a very nice calculator built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just doesnt seem to work it does nt load on some computers	0

i spent a lot of time on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
i have been trying to get a few songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
the only downside is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i would have rated it five stars but its not worth it	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
after multilple tries one of them was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the labeling of the product itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
the pc sync feature is superb that can be used with nokia pc suite software	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat more advanced analytics application which converts all types of metrics	0
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
i s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
not a bad monitor for but it is not the best	1
this is by far the finest camera in the world that i have ever used	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i tried to give them all the information i could	0

also the computer sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i was a little surprised to see it in the low end	0
excellent battery life hours of play time ipod is	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a hard disk read next the ultimate travel guide for the nomad	1

software is absolutely terrible	0
cons i think i look ugly	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize the disc and takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0

transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as a folder so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the wrong place and the service tech failed to believe what the customer service rep said was wrong	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
then my book would get so boring it would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
this is by far the nicest thing ive ever done in so many ways	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass and a good amount of treble for such a small unit	1

even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small speakers	1
for the money and they have good features	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on any device and not just the computer	1

just an average user getting good value in this product	1
when it works its great to have but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0

i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
the internet functions of the phone will not work and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would allow you to configure the phone to be connected to the internet	0
it s not all about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
i am very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
the netgear i got for my birthday was great and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
this is a list	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked really well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
i selected the highest quality camera and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
this wonderful little box was easy to unbox and install	1
if you want to rename a file to a title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is too loud	0
this is by far the finest i have seen in its price and category i have ever used	1
for the price it is a very good investment	1
i am happy and have no complaints over this unit	1
it would spin read spin read read read and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
the cover that came with it did nt look good	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is a bit bulky and it would be better if it came with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it was a bit slow between shots	0
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
i tried to contact the apex cust service no help	0
it has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the clock and the clock face and the radio	1
one complaint is that it is too easily scratched	0
the team is top notch	1
while i had the phone the main features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
one of the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
i cant believe the storage in this thing	0
this is a list	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all seem to play great	1
not only is it more affordable but its also better for windows which is what i have	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the images are quite impressive	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i have to say i am even more pleased with it	1
i t	0
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light	1
well within days the video output was working	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big enough to hold the volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the screen is very easy to read and the screen is bright enough to read at night but not bright enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
when i saw a lot of places where there was metal i was concerned that the music would not be as good	1
it wo nt in all of my movies	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other speaker ive ever used best speakers i ve owned	1
i got this for my birthday and for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
a button switch	0
one also exhibited extremely slow response times when going to the menu	0
the keys are set to come out normal so there is no guessing	1
the size is small	1
our special friends at creative music have a great review of this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1

typically the problem is that it isnt but it was for me and many others	0
this app is the best i have used to date	1
i have been ripping songs into it for a while now and the ease of use is wonderful	1
because this camera is awesome	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
i am enjoying it a lot	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of it	1
what is added in functionality vs what is lost in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
worked out	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i think it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0

so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
and so far i have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
overall good for the price	1
the remote is hard to get used to feeling and awkward to use	0
good luck life	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting such as a room where you have a lot of people and only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no way to use on the fly playlist creation such as with the ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with your phone number or phone numbers address books ect like the ip	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
easy to set up	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very happy with this day forecaster	1
they caused the problem by putting the wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were nice to have but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
when i put it to use at is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
well within days the video output quit working	0

this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every month or so	0
this thread has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1

the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram i had i could not stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
reviews for sound quality and performance	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two of them now both with defective switches	0
i wished that they could make it just a little bit louder	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely out of date and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
as it stands now the case is that it doesn t really matter unless you re packing the car up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an easy to use interface i also liked the fm phone and earpiece	1
even the bass is pretty good even from such rather small drivers	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
i did nt read a single thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i would love to replace the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for it	1
scroll button switch	0
i just received my gb zen xtra in the mail and i m extremely pleased with it	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
speakerphone	1

sound settings can be changed	1
i am using them on my laptop and they generally sound good	1
the compact size of the camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0

the moveable lcd screen	1
the connection is not reliable and has been dropped	0
i had to take my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
as a portable player it should feel a lot lighter and more durable	0
speed means fast data transfers	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected just keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion is probably not the best when it comes to a lot of people	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use it works well most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have a hard time with it at first rate some find it so frustrating that they just return	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about a month now and i am very happy with it	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the lack of a manual	0

i have listened to these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and drag and drop songs directly from cd to your players	1

sound effects are amazing and base is amazing	1
without a doubt i don t care at all if the exposure is low or high the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1

however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the rest of the process so i dont think it was a problem	0
the sound is awesome but if you put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
i would have given it five stars but for the poor quality	0
i bought this laptop as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change my mind as soon as possible	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is a bit more space to work with it	0
the optical zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry the optical zoom and the x digital zoom is very nice	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping of the tags fails to populate the year field	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of stuff on this thing	1
after a long wait one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige signal	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually turning it or not and turning it by feel alone	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
i do nt know what other people are doing with this but the software is awesome	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1

battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
all i can say is that this is awesome	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than they actually are	0
also i can t understand why the site does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
the on off button doesnt work and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
it is well packaged	1
i love being in this thing	1
perhaps the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by simply opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
storage space	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a strap on the back and it is a bit slow between shots	0
now that i have all my music back i can say that there has nt been any more problems	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
i was willing to live with the small size but the durability was a big zero	0
i also like the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1

the color of the ring is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
