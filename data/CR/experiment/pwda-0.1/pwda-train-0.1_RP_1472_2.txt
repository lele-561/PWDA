battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have been using it	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0

the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0

i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i love it	1
the excels as a cell phone is a god	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be better off with a gb portable hard drive albeit one that is so small i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does not work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0

i treat the battery well and it has a long life	1

finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
bookmarks in the browser are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the lcd is much brighter than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which can be used to illuminate the screen more successfully than the nis is green backlight did	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
the sound quality is very good the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you get home	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have xbox one of the others are usualy moderate or strict when i called them they were very nice and tried th	0

first the iphone x lets you sync to more than one computer	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built in	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
well it had good power but no power at all	1
they deliver a very loud sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
it is well packaged	1

but i would definately recommend it	1
even the bass is pretty good even from such rather small drivers	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can now create any song playlist etc fast enough	1

this product is hard to beat	1

if you re looking for a great wireless tower speaker this is it	1
i was a little worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
its great	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two of them now both with defective switches	0
anyways back to the point i was trying to make i have tried to be so patient over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
the free computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
also very light and portable	1

you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i tried to give them all the information i could	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
they are fantastic	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and easy to set up and the battery duration is amazing	1
other than that the picture is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
please note that it can t play all of the dvd	0
the dvd player is fine	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0

it really impressed me with the disign the specs the phone has	1

i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
the manual is easy to read and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
easy to set up	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and shuffle only for your now playing songs you can also create your own playlists or playlists	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of the content	0
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
this little speaker has it all	1
because it can make a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i will nt buy again because of the customer service	0
i am quite happy with the results	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
whether you ve been taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is much lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
whether you re taking a brisk walk waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you did	1
and amazon com has it for less than how can you go wrong	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a portable mp player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the best thing about this model is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
simply this product did not work and was left behind	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus very quickly	1
have used it frequently and successfully	1
price gb of oil	1
i thought it was just the sound of the speakers but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is not working and it is ruining my media	0
however it is not real intuitive	0
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
there was neither picture nor sound	0
it will be equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
i personally would like to see this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
if i were to rate these books based on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m not going to do that because i think they do the job that most people want them for	0
i highly recommend	1
it works great	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave the house	0
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
do nt buy a car	0
the device is small and well designed i would recommend it	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with a few presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
this is insanely fast	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
the interface software itself which should be easy to use was anything but easy to do	0
for the money apex machines have lost	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good user experience	0
audio is excellent	1
if you do nt have tags it will lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or genre tags as the search engine does not recognize folders	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely in my pocket without falling out	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
i have not played with all the features yet but i can tell you that it is easy to use once you get used to it	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in it and that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i really love this netbook	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
typically it is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
kudos apple for your support your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
the prints are available	1
very long lasting battery life	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
tech support from apex is almost nonexistent	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to set up and easy to access and use	1
storage space	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helps	0
the picture is good and the sound is good	1
my only gripe about the hardware is	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
first of all the player is better than the ipod second it is superior to the ipad	1
with the lack of a knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the product	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos and is a great camera that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and a great warranty but by far not least	1
i ve been using the g suite for about a year now and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
you can stop using rrb if you want this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with this company and their terrible service and support	0
i bought it because it looked easy to install	1
can t beat carrying a good book collection with me wherever i go	0
i purchased the nomad jukebox for my xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
i hate widescreen monitors	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only be available through t mobile is services because they have been installed on the phone the following are the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used	0
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent and stronger	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
huge storage space for your music even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of problems	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover art	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
this digital camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now in the trash	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with him	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is a great alternative to a good cddb service	1
awesome sound quality	1
it came well packaged	1
and amazon com has it for less than how can you go wrong	1
but after days the sound came back but the video quit working	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music player on the computer	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
when the radio was working it was great but	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t be done with some of your real dvds	0
great minds	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone but it is a very good phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phablet than any i have ever used	1
like other reviewers said it was hell	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
in that model the hard drive just died the day before my class	0
again the sounds were turned on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac we have to use the phone with the base or it turns	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major online retailers as well as two brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
great minds	1
i am really impressed by this young player	1
the tools that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
its cheap and it comes with a remote control	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and a little hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
it is the most bang for the buck you can get	1
i cant believe the storage in this thing	0
the eax features are designed to be useful as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the noise and vibration encountered in a car or on a train	0
what the hell is going on with this thing	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs and lows excellent clarity and respectable bass	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
this is amazing	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my pocket and forget about it	1
i am using them in my office and they generally seem to be very good	1
the battery life	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using it	0
the world is borderuer lcd scoying	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software to make it work in the first place	0
it is so small but big value mac	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got disconnected	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers good battery life	1
only if we could find them	0
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
fm receiver it has been renamed	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the images are quite impressive	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed to out of the box	0
the cover that came with the book did nt fit very well	0
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
sound very good and the bass is very deep as well	1
i tried it and it would not work as advertised i called support	0
the scene mode works in the same way for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
i tried called them but no help	0
the sound quality is	1
another nice thing is that it has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before i bought it	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player i found in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal to be desired	0
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
it is not	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
this is a list	0
one good thing it is not a waste of disk space	1
great camera	1
the software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
seems like a good product	1
usb cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
well on keypad	1
they say	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
not a bad monitor for but it is not the best	1
i really liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
at the very least a larger and more protective carrying case would be nice	0
minimal pause between playing and pausing much less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
they fired away and it all turned out quite nicely	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality and longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything about the price as you are just paying for this net book	1
sound exceptional though i can t really put my finger on it to the ipod	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and looks good	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it that i could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps only	1
lrb lost internet connection with the modem rrb the internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem at rrb	0
oh yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge to the internet i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
i have used a lot of phones but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i gave the zen player a because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not a player that i would consider appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this is what i got and it did the job i bought it for admirably	1
nikon i feel is the best gaming laptop out there for the features and price	1
everything was great until it started to rain and we lost internet connection sporadically	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up hitting the enter when i meant to scroll	0
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio experience	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database is very small and the memory utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
this is a great portable speaker for your ipod but wanted to let a few people know that if you have an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
i am delighted with this product	1
player works and looks great if you can get past how hard it is to play	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast ratio brightness contrast ratio and viewing angles	1
i love that it is so easy to use and it looks likeit andit it it it it it it it it it it it it it it	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the player hangs up the phone every once in a while prompting a reset	0
the quality of the pictures in the auto mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
second is that in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
i was really looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
the device is very well made and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
you can do so much more with the jme suite i mean you can get free ringtones from midi files free graphics from jme and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews i read said it was slow	0
the player itself has a lot of problems	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is	1
last night i realized i needed to reset the router	0
his voice is very exceptable	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching it	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flash cards just as it does with the dedicated flashes on the g	0
p it is not lite on weight so it is a bit heavy but i definately recommend it to anyone out there	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have a lot of people around and you can always take the camera with you and take pictures of them	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
and i love the taste of jbl and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
a sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
it is not	0
easy enough to navigate through although i would prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip and burn catalog burn before i bought the zen and zen software	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
as a whole i think it has a sleek design and works fine	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
the software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset the router far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection id like to see some of the latest bandwidth management software	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not play in order they play one after another like on a cd	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
good luck	1
the volume range is adjustable so you can blast it if you want	1
this is absolutely terrible	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer players and jvc players	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is amazing	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but i think this one really deserves five stars	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my results	1
tech support was very pleasent and easy to deal with once you actually got someone	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use with a good range of features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
the technical support phone number that was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
looks fantastic with my w iphone docked	1
i have yet to try out all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the menu system is relatively clear	1
dr paul is okayed	1
i am bored with it	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
the digital zoom takes twice as long as the optical zoom does	1
it took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
sounds like a good product	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i ve been a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
the battery in my car will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
and so far have not had any problems with any of the players not being able to play	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera then you can end your search with the nikon	1
the headphone earbuds are not compatible with the headphones so just use your regular pair instead	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is made mostly of plastic	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
mr trump is trash	0
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
when i finally made it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
i love this player and would probably play him	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
about of the time it can t find the right file to open when i attach it to my pc	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
and the sound quality is very good there is no complaints about that	1
the sound quality are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the right side of the screen the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
my friends were very impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
small print	1
i ve used it for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the screen is good	1
great phone i d buy now	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me up	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten used to it and comfortable with it	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other apps i ve had	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up my books and put them on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
great phone i d buy another	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nn fast even when accessing it with a web browser	0
i just bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of with a lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is a good one	1
only one of the dvd players works so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not been able to recover it	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
as a portable player it should feel good	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for me	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
reviews for sound quality and performance	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
at first i dealt with this as well but it was still really fast	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all seem to play great	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
they are really good just as the reviews say	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights for a while now and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
naturally i did a lot of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
they are not the same	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
i was dissapointed that the e mail address was nt more helpful	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
the has the following function which is utterly useless	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
for me its perfect and the quality for the price is more than acceptable	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
it is very light weight and has a very good signal strength	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very interesting	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it plays them	1
the future is good	1
the plan is okayed	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening is very difficult and the listening qualities are very poor	0
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the rest of the process so i dont think it was a problem	0
this item was the most inexpensive and best quality monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my expectations	1
this is a nice feature i e it is a bit early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening then heavy metal no problem	1
they are not the same	0
also it was only with free shipping and it was a good price so overall it is a decent player	1
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in noise cancellation in the crossovers	0
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
volume level is ok	1
the design of the phone is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
this led monitor is fantastic	1
i keep e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should have been on the screen of the tv	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
some people have complained that the case comes with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player but this has not been a problem for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
high quality picture and features	1
the phone has a few problems that you would expect but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to have	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say that it worked works fine right out of the box	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
it is lighter to carry around and it is more portable	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful design	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great value for money and mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
all of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
video output stopped workin	0
the switch negotiated the speed of the router and presented the router with a gige link	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting is that the zen xtra is not included in this list	0
with the exception that the volume is loud enough at	1
this is great	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the computer used for data processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits in your hand and can fit into any pocket without falling out	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
its far heavier and a bit larger which might not seem to matter to most people but it does if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i am still in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was a kid	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
anything it does it does perfectly	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost and high quality it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the u s government shutdown is a travesty enough said	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
i hate apex but i love it and i tell everyone	0
long lasting battery life	1
video output of workin	1
it does not only have trouble playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for the speakers and the remote are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the best sound possible so i do not	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turned out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of instructions on installing for apple computers	0
the world is small	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
i was looking for a little bit of everything and this product delivers both	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
you can adjust the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really useful if shooting a scene that is tough to focus on and you need to manually	1
it had a heavier and more durable casing	0
the keyboard is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these speakers cost	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on its side	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
the machine is very easy to use and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
i bought this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it works great	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
the remote control works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
the rate plans are not very good at least for me	0
the lcd screen is	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
it has all the features one could ever need in a cellphone	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find out how it works	0
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
i think im glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
the controls are on the left side instead of the right side which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the world	0
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked like this	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would not be able to survive a drop	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt rotate the lens but the lens maker knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the barrel distortion phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is all in my backyard and in the corner of my basement	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected back to the modem rrb	0
excellent sound i love the sound of the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
bottom line well made camera easy to use and has very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my patio table or coffee stand	1
it sucks	0
on average indoor shots in the us are not quite as good as mm	0
oh and the screen saver on my phone is pretty sweet	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
because other people that complain about the speed of the ball are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be heard	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
this is the best video i have seen	1
it is gb of disk space	0
the color is red and is so attractive	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got a response from them because the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the price	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd w rw dvd l rw	1
other things that i miss are a headphone jack and a standard mm headset jack	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
i fully expect it to turn out to be bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
i did buy the latest version of the software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
the acer monitor is very compact and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from the front to the back that many screens will not fit in	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a link which will take you to a website with your os if you choose to use it	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and have used	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
about of the time it can t be seen on the device when i attach it to my pc	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well but they are still below expectations for this price	0
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality great battery life great hd size and price make it a good buy	1
vocals have greater clarity with the guitar as well	1
the player has the option to play the game which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
the scene mode will work very well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
please take a look at this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
the sound is awesome but if u play it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
a small hole runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	0
i ve also had the urge to do a zen lock up several times	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need to learn them	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance on their own or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
nice and all	1
apple is bigger than the ipod	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i would like	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
the hair is so soft you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
this is amazing	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one was a bit of a mess when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
i ve had this for months now and i am so happy with my decision	1
for the price and the quality of it is really good	1
i was able to get some great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids in their costumes	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and not work properly but it may be just operator error	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
the results were both good	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
range of functions as indicated above it has a lot of features for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
this product is good enough to integrate my car into the cx to my toyota camry mode	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
what makes the lack of resolution and lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
it has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a variety of connection methods and i still can t get any information from the machine	0
the bike is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the interface software itself which should be very user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound system	1
it is not it	0
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
but anyway what i think you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
very good value for money	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not work	0
i m extremely happy that i bought this camera	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
the second set is working just fine	1
this is better than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
do you want to buy this monitor	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
connect the player to your xtra open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtrail	1
this phone is a joke	0
what a day	1
upon opening these i found them to be very well made small but having a solid feel to them	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music on the go	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even heard of any equalizers	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
hdtv for competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its great	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite getting the id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to take into account the year field	0
i find all of the controls well placed and i am not disappointed in the least	1
i do nt for the life of me see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with the excellent customer	1
it is small	1
the bottom line is that this is an excellent game enjoy	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
coupon price	0
fact is it will nt be easier to use	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are better	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
bottom line is for the price these things are great and have tons of good bass	1
this system is currently unavailable	0
second the automatic save feature on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it for a while	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
if you are not picky about image quality	0
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness of the screen are so low i cant see across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
i am using them in my office and they generally seem to be very good	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
however when i plugged it into my laptop mini the screen looked wonderful	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
price	1
this thing is trash	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with the mms software which you will enjoy	1
the headphone jack is going to be a major problem	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
progressive scan technology for a relatively low price	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by artist but there are also tracks which are not listed but are organized alphabetically	0
i highly recommend it	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
in this case it comes with a remote control	1
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
i have tried so many ways to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their website is always busy	0
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on every site	0
i agree with the other reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle and you need to adjust the brightness in order to get consistent contrast	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think this is a good idea and offers some advantages	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and very well made	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got for them unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know about	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install a new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
made call which was immediately taken care of by very helpful competent tech	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless d link d link work fine as	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker system	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
but if you want a great deal and want to get the nomad	0
the big backlight makes things easier to read and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
very intuitive and easy to use controls are a big plus on this camera	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use controls and features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
the text is large and easily read	1
so easy to set up had no problems with my archos	1
also the player sometimes freezes in the middle of the game but can also be annoying	0
this is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
also the player has to wait for the game freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
the screen may be a little smaller but it still looks great and does nt come in the overused blue	0
i am not going to rate it because it is not really appropriate for the class that it is in and it is really appropriate to rate them based on players in a different class	1
the controls are a bit inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i think this is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
easy to do but it did not work	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of the windows media	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you dont even know it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	0
this was very prompt standard shipping and handling	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
the following is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am very happy to finally be rid of them and look forward to august when i will be able to switch our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
the digital zoom on a dslr takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
excellent phone the phone is so much better than what u see in the pictures	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
very tight joints with a matte black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one way to get a ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
a great product unbeatable price	1
my experience with this monitor was very poor	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and the sound is good enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
i am the best so far	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid a lot of money for	0
i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
the contrast ratio and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this system	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
great minds	1
and the sound well there is no complaints at all	1
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did not work at all	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not seem to work with the mls very well at all	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will tell you what to do with your os if you want to use it	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
this has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has worked so well for me during the time i have been watching it	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
so easy to set up had some fun playing around with my archos	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
the pc sync feature is superb that can be used with nokia pc suite software	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
im sorry for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the creative labs zen game is a great game that has all the features the i am game has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on the deck	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would be able to use them due to the huge difference in price	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option and the fact that it gives me instant messaging and access to my corporate email	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to see so you can t really make an accurate adjustment	0
im on mine	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
the price was the lowest i d seen in my entire life and i lrb best buy office depot rrb	1

protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
for the price and the quality you can t beat the price	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very well made	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t be done with some of your real dvds	0
battery life the most important feature to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
this phone is also one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
i was looking for a phone for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright screen	1
the bottom line is that this is an excellent game enjoy	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
full size	1
the image quality is excellent	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1

overall i would reccomend these to someone who is looking for a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are intuitive	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
the only thing i would be concerned about is the quality of the buttons on the thing	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually have the ability to pick up a signal	1
the explorer app did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the app or anything just open up explorer again	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0

you can be a mile away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
no changes to the format	0

it is just such a nice thing to have a non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1

overall an excellent game	1
very good value for money	1
one complaint is that it is too easily scratched	0
all other buttons are very easy to use sensitive to touch and work well	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate placement of the sub woofer and you cant hear the bass from the subwoofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
focusing on a display that was about feet away in a brightly lit room with a bright light source the pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
it is a bit more expensive than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work as well when battery is low	0
even after reading through some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
the trial lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
works great	1
i think this is another excellent creative product	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
i really like this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
it has good color and price was great	1
price gb of storage	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster drivers which is very annoying	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
so now it still plays in the background you just can t see it	0
the internal network still had a signal but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this list to be quite disturbing	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
as i mentioned before the new mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said and though not perfect it may still work better	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
i like this player	1
it is made of plastic	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
you of course have some good customization options with your phone as well	1

wow this speaker really rocks	1
a little too weighty but otherwise fine	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
both of the problem dvd is would play and then freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is better	1

as often happens in games the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
the build quality is excellent	1
for the first few weeks this dvd player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi media player it is a great dvd players with a stylish slim case as advertised	1

the manual is easy to read and it is mostly idiot proof	1
for the price of a few dollars the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
this really is a great little phone its very well made and very nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
other things that i would like to see are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
very good range and it seems to be better in the horizontal position	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i only have one complaint and that is	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i expected	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the fact that it has a camera on top of it	1
recieved this product in the mail for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network very easy to use	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the max but audio aspects on the other hand are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i have to say i have been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to the side to protect it against any damage	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
speakerphone	1
portable	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
i paired this app on to two different android phones	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
this product is not available at any price	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
the scroll bar on the right is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
the ihome is stereo reproduction system	0
i t	0
first of all my words were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for money	1

it was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1

with the smooth surface of my hand i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and if i just feel it by feel alone	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
this new speaker has dynamite sound	1

but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
fm receiver it has none	0
hooked it worked like a charm great picture to look at and very light weight	1

but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very easy	0
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online reviewers will go into more detail in their reviews but i am very pleased with the quality of the camera and the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0

the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
p fantastic little computer does a lot more than i had hoped for work study travel	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0

it is a very good camera and well worth the price	1
sure it is a little bigger than the others but not by much	0
since it would not work as advertised i decided to delete it	0
the book is well written and does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no detailed description of the installation just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0

it is lighter to carry around than a laptop and it has enough functionality to use	1
the hands free speakerphone is getting more powerful	1

also this player is a plus unlike my previous player	1

the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1

please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual router as well as the local computer desktop portals and be able to connect to the router and do things like upload attach etc	1

the touchpad is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1

when talking the voice is	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0

having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0

the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
i try navigating to a chapter past the end of the menu and it would nt do it	0
i m not sure but i ll probably buy more for the front channels	0

no option for i t i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
not counting the time i spent editing it it was pretty painless	1

its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1

featured image	1
here is a pic of the phone the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the third went out	0

the moveable lcd is awesome and is great	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex court seat again	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play a lot of music and i had my fill of files	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
this is absolutely terrible	0
a security camera great investment	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
usb network storage supposedly it is	0
this phone is not recommended otherwise	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1

the sounds were as they were intended	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
if you are not picky about image quality then go for it	0
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
the food is really good	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected just keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion is probably not the best when it comes to a lot of people	1

as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
great phone	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing music and the sound quality is excellent and the picture and sound is top notch	1
it seems to me that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
i am very happy with this phone and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have not even gotten to all of them yet	1
also very light and fluffy	1
i selected the highest quality camera and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love someone so much	1
it is a great travel companion if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who are willing to pay a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
my favorite thing about the nomad life	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
this is by far the nicest one in so many years	1
but i think it is perfect	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
the scroll wheel is a bit of a pain	0
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the new one is amazing and the sound is amazing	1
i have to say that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
now when the power to the computer fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
the app is loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit and receive data across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
it works flawlessly during installation	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
the only problem is it could nt be easier to use	1
i think the software is crap	0
no option for caller id pictures or the ability to set ringtones	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads s and downloads s quickly and there is no lag between songs	1
good luck life	1

loading the app on my phone was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0

but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best one out there	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no way for me to update to support this product	1
this program was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was made in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the rest of the process without a problem	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with a wide range of devices including sansas and ipods	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature	0

it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
i find it too bright	0
i love this i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
this is a list	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main deciding factors on why i picked the nomad	1
the best thing about this monitor is the stand	0
not only is it the perfect size it also has a great screen and has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
the nokia phone is a great phone to have if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get something from nothing	0
i bought this monitor from a friend of mine a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see on the screen is what you get	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress me	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has ever made	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the macro lens is terrific for point and shoot	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i thought i needed to reset the router	0
the camera has a single lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
other than that it is great	1
it worked from to at first but then the picture failed completely	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
your site has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
i highly recommend it	1
i am using the i n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything in the extreme	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light but it is not as good as it allows the camera to focus in low traffic	0
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
the sound quality is amazing and you can even record it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
the evidence is staggering	0
transfers are made through usb	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can get a lot of sound and not get much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
convenience because it is	1
it may	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
the g has a different type of charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without having to worry about running down the battery	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
when it comes to receiver it has none	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around for a long time and it s even when in the same room	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
they could be more comfortable but no one is going to complain in the sound department	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
i just got a chance to play this player and i have to say that i love it	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is too small	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being able to live without it	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal if you are not using it that s not what you are buying it for	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i have never seen anything like it within its resolution range	1
so besides the annoyances this is a good deal for the amount i paid	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
in short if you are just a guy that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get you online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks off and makes me want my beer but does nt wash my car	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it is the first time i have tried it out so much the better	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
it was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
overall i like it	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses the latest hardware acceleration	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form as well	1
on my main computer it just did not work right	0
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
even the slightest of touches to your face totally distorts your image	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
good battery life	1
while upgrading the memory i noticed something broke	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
picture quality is excellent	1
there is also no height adjustability so it will always be very low to the desk	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi hdtv is a great way to watch lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtc and its delivering great	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am bored	0
this dvd play is full of junk	0
i think the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
and the body construction in general has been a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel and the heft of the s	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not be able to be dropped easily like typical american phones	0
the windows premium is very good and the lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
is nice	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
it also has a microsd card slot which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipods do not bother this is a much better buy also you can store data on	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high end travel size camera i initially turned my attention to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
door code	1
i am not to sure if this will work with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	0
i tried as many as i could of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to social media and music services and pc compatibility are the main goals	1
after nearly pictures i have to say that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
i called apex is support number and tried to hang up but it just kept ringing	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light is really bright the music is perfect fast as well the built in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the mp player	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a robot should be	1
the signs were nt so clear	0
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it works great	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on a single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
its silver magnesium finish is a nice touch and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
there are	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load all of my music onto this unit	1
this player seems to work really well with everything else	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
overall a sweet machine	1
i have the same age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the images are quite impressive	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
i have owned this game for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
this system is very powerful	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd my ipod nano	0
a great system at work	1
the replacable battery is great since once it runs out or wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
wire runs through the body of the device giving it a very clean look	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
we are well on our way with the monitor and the company	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think this is a good idea and offers some advantages	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disc without vcd formatting	1
this player is not available for sale at any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were free	1
key instead	0
and i am a big fan of jbl and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
the level of interest in the level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
got a system error a few days after purchase	0
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player in my opinion was the software	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
software the software is crap	0
mitsubishi eclipse light compact	1
all in all this is a great product that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is easy to understand and use and a great sound	1
good range speed	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses to navigate to the files that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
price along with the quality of the product were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
one also exhibited the same behavior when going to the menu	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy access to a lot of i d tags	1
i purchased both of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
flash as with all things in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to know or have memorized where they are in the menu in order to select them by using the number keypad	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or use	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
i spend hours at a time in a vnc session trying to figure out how the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
for the price it is a well worth investment	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does have a few quirks	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am not a fan	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
her response was prompt	1
the zooming lever is a nice touch but i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at the time	1
it is so small but it has value mac	1
it also has unproven effects on human life	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the music and the radio	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you cant go wrong	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
selected it because it was free and easy to install	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i am not giving because i think they do the job that most people need them to do	0
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
the first routers will be good for years	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are better	1
i m very happy with these i will probably buy more for the front and back	1
by phone	0
one also exhibited extremely slow response times when going to the menu	0
it did play some of the music which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and the volume is really high	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can customize your sound	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do not anticipate any problems with it	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector was removed	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to break	0
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are very good with m m pixel fine combos and the quality of the pictures are very similar to that of a	1
picture quality is excellent	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
in that model the hard drive just died on me this morning before my class	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass so if you want that you will need a huge subwoofer	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
the ability to connect a usb thumb drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the sound settings but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to set up my sound settings in is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound quality	0
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved all the files and know i have to open up my sound card to listen to them every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
the sound from the player is not audible	0
the backlight will periodically fail the first time you turn it on so i sent it in for warranty repair	0

speed and range speed	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has a few issues such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we play it or it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
this is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
its fine	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
the storage capacity is great	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its performance	1
the sound quality is really good	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts an excellent user interface with a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
it is crystal clear	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it was a good deal	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
my gut tells me the nomad will turn out to be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one that i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive one that will result in companies never to buy products from again	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress was halted when the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the user interface now there is interface	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control is a little off so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting to the full	0
you can also assign a special number to special people when they call	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
the text on the screen was very large and readable	1
scroll down to switch	0
scroll button switch	0
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1

it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
the woofer is a	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
lots of options and it has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
it has a nice color screen	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
it will read and play for you	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
this is the best dvd player i have	1
over all a fantastic very good camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music on my phone	1
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
no problems with dropped signals unlike the old router it replaced which only lasted months	1
fortunately the g has an internal flash that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy in the world	1
the brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter but it does if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i would like	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it would keep me from having to carry a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich were also of similar characteristics	1
loved the slim fit	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the hard drive with room for about more	1
the man who looks like a work of art	1
i find it to be very easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
do not buy this player	0
it may	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for the first time was under minutes	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product in a large house but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and in the kitchen with no signal interruptions	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
its silver finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of things you can do with it that i have nt even gotten to	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
this fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are similar to and even excel the ipod	1
you can stop looking this is the best free router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
proven in terms of built quality and lens	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
the sound quality is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you can see you own reflection on the screen	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well but they are still below expectations for this price	0
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
getting access to the device is so easy	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
i think that its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
just an average user but there is good value in this product	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
i ve been using numerous different monitor models since i m a kid and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
update the system has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the customer support is very rude	0
the fm radio is cool	1
the game itself is pretty solid	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
the sound this slim design makes	1

it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
this was an earlier version of the player before the video output no longer worked	0
i only have one complaint and that is	0

this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the quality of communication with the player is sub par	0
please add a feature that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual web browser as well as the local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
you can extend the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting with a camera that is not able to automatically focus	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the one i mentioned above i view as the most beneficial	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex of a player i love it	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
a hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it does not have a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0

it is not	0
the only thing that has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as season season and season	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
it is easy to use and it is feature complete	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
the handlebar strap is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful device	1
troubles with comparing data storage with price	0
this wonderful product was created	1

its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
after looking around for a decent high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
the player has firmware which will allow you to fix the glitches if there are any	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however some users have complained that the scroll wheel itself is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1

this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
with this mp player you get much more than a mp player for much less than an ipod	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1

conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway traffic	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1

simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at the moment	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd indeed	1
i have a problem with my computer yesterday when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
the screen is very easy to read and the screen is bright enough to read at night but not bright enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
the interface of the creative software is not real intuitive	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline battery for those emergency pics you have to have	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with any of my apps and the list goes on and on	0
i have been trying to get a few songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of time to cool down to allow for air circulation	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
takes excellent care	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice photographer	1
the price is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
there was occasionally a	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the music to organize your songs	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
picture quality is poor	0
in other words the ipod is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
the speakerphone is great and all features work perfectly	1
i do nt want to be rude but this computer is incredible	1
also i can t understand why the software does not list the cds in alphabetical order the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home network with a cable modem as input	1
depressing the scroll button is not always a good idea	0
the company offers a range of metering options as well	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is not a big deal because all i need is something to do with my iphone	0
screen was bright and easy to read	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures and does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has been amazing	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
i have this monitor for the first time and i m very pleased with it	1
i would recommend this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
however you do it you get what you pay for in reliable products	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are using the zen software but i was using musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
the functionality on this camera is limited	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
it was already there and we just plugged it in	0
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig you do easy	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
but when we tried to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is very good	1
first the cons a tad higher than the pros not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
the pictures come out so much better if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a lot better than the standard band eq	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as long as it looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
despite this minor disappointment i would still recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	0
only con i can think of is no camera	0
for now i could not ask for more	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
well it had good power but no power at all	1
her response was prompt	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router was broken and i had to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of stuff on this thing	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new linkys dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i would have bought the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it very difficult to select the best time for the city forecasts in my area	0
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
there is also no height adjustability so it sits right next to the desk	0
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
i remain hopeful	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still plenty of light	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is that you want to use as a power adapter	0
i do nt know if that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
you can create a playlist and drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your players	1
works super easy	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb shipped it to me on tuesday and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows me to get rid of i d tags	1
i really like the quality of the pictures	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
the player has its minor glitches like sometimes when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my likings	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
set up and run with no problems	1
now when the backlight fails i have to plug it in and leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
seriously i love it	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were not moving the photos were awesome	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
overall rating	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
another point of note the quality of his life is incredible	1
i recommend unreservedly the g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
range was comparable to or possibly better than the old linksys router i had been using for years	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
this is my first digital camera and i love how it is	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can be very loud in a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month and already it feels like i ve well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
loved the slim design	1
i loved it until it was gone but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you a lot of freedom to be creative yet its progam and the exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
without a doubt i would have to say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly the best i have ever heard lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
i am very happy with its quality and durability	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not difficult to use in the least	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it though	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
it comes as a free app with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	0
the volume	0
they are clears and perfect to be used in a boat along with a sub	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
this game is a winner	1
we bought two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours since i picked it up for my son for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this d dvd player	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
the only drawback is the speaker is not very deep and is very thin	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a huge plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play all of my jpeg files on a hard drive as well as cd r data	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
also i have not had trouble reading any of the mp and vbr mp cds	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to be able to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
these monitors are available	1
the screen is a little scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
the monitors are	1
i love this monitor	1
this is my second creative music player and it is definitely a fine product	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
great product that works perfectly for my office	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
the problem for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
however the main reason i am not too impressed with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
both units are equipped with similarly small speakers	1
the quality of the lcd screen is great	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all work together	1
sound quality is good	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
what this phone does it does perfectly	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this morning i have an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
it was terrible	0
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
oops i forgot to go online and adjust it there	0
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
the best thing about the hardware is the buttons	0
i try navigating back to the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
yes the features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
the sound is excellent as one would expect to hear from a creative product	1
i like the size and the shape of this little critter	1
i usually avoid horns but i do not want to hear anything overly extreme	0
i have no doubt that my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod to the speaker without removing the iskin and removing the skin	1
the scroll wheel is a bit of a pain	0
before asking for the zen xtra mp player i researched a few different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
after i rebooted the device it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i booted the device reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
now that i own it and love it i can t imagine being without it	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the screen	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies and i put them on dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power button is too small and the volume key is small and difficult to press	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither in the book nor the cd version	0
i find this to be a great story	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
i bought this set it up and it works fine but i could not connect at wireless n speeds	0
this app is a replacement for your desktop	1
they have a pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
both of the problem dvd is that it would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a great point and shoot camera in the mid to high end price range	1
people on the forum have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
exasperated at am i right i am calling it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
despite this minor issue i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
this is a list	0
the battery life is amazing	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very happy with it so far	1
i am very happy with its quality and durability	1

after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
the sounds were as the movie directors wanted them	1
it takes approximately to an hour for it to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does not sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot times in one hour lrb that	0
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not	1
navigation is easy and i found that copying and pasting files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
this is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
i chose to use the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
this article is an ideal purchase	1
it is a fun little gadget do not expect high definition sound	0
however i do not like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
great sound very long battery life with fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the service at the airport is very good too	1
after speaking with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i wanted i do nt for see myself having any issues with it	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
full sound full sound from full base to great highs	1
it is very small and seems quite small to me and very light	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface and security flaws	0
black and white balance	1
you can adjust the volume so that it doesnt go anywhere or so much that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
in any case navigation by artist album is a good idea however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and drag and drop songs directly from cd to your players	1
because this camera is beautiful	1
i am very proud of this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
of course i have no idea what it is but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp in the market	1
its fast forward and rewind function works much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software was saying and didnt know what was wrong	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
the lack of support is very rude	0
seems like a good product	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
i try to play the game using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
i have this monitor for the first time and i m very pleased with it	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
much faster than my previous acer one that i had with single processor	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
the software on this one is pretty good	1
i have been using this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
my first impression was positive	1
due to the lack of features and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i can set that at minimum brightness for at night or daytime	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the g but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
and the fact that the construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
the internal network still had a signal but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
other tagging problems to be solved from the nomad is operating system	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to my website	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
the router i was using today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the is a very durable compact package and i have found nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1

in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
do nt buy this player	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent quality photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
the system is very similar to the ipod in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	0
user replaceable battery	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in a beta stage at best	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say that i have enjoyed it	1
unlike some of my friends who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	0
get super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
but the sound is very good and it works very well on my portable speakers	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
the problems came from my video card	0
the router failed today lrb is not able to connect to rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
the only thing i would say is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i would change from my is voice dialing	0
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your files into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or genre tags as the zen does not recognize folders	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the freedom	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t really get an accurate adjustment	0
the iphone plus has a wonderful set of features	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in your computer and have network accessible storage	1
this phone is good with a huge screen and a lot of features built into it	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
the software is	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable to wear and easy to use	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1

quality quality quality	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
if you have speaker cable why do this	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the money	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with no id	0
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and h and comes with even more features	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only for your music collection the zen has the capacity you need for your audio collection	0
a good person is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
the d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to connect to my fios optical network and i couldnt get the ethernet link speed from my fios network to my router	1
well this is my first dvd player turned out great	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
the speakers are nice no question about that the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
but when we went to use it again there was no sign of it but no picture	0
i like the fact that the base is running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the lack of acer	0

i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put so much effort and quality into the g	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
only con i can think of is no one knows	0
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was very good	1
however it has the potential to deliver on quality	1

i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of performance	1
this player is an in game purchase	1
it does well in all aspects of internet marketing	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results in the long run	1
the pc side is a little slow and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
video output format	1

i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
the changing colors help to tell the time with a quick glance	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install it on my computer but this did not solve the problem	0
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
all and all i am extremely happy with this camera	1

quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
the in and out of i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural but those of you who are familiar with the subwoofer know to turn it all the way down but it is all right because these are	0
i would have rated it five stars but its not worth it	0
and so far i have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the side is stiff	0
the performance of the netbook with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled but the other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	0
the fm app is cool	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is when i used it in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of the box	1

i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen a camera that can do so much better within its resolution limits	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like an alarm clock and a stopwatch	1
if you are looking for a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates and we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
things are a lot more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with the old one	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
the screen is not backlit	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
the other day when i was listening to it i got it locked up and will not do anything now	0

the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has still not come loose	1
it looked just right	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with all the necessary software to make sharing printers and other peripherals a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown	1
the software has never been a hassle for me at all	1
replacement battery is available	1
i dont need any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i have ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
it is small light and very attractive	1
featured image	1

it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
the sound is a bit muffled but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	0
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice addition to my speaker set	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop up on the radio i was sold	1
so now it still plays in the background you just can t see it	0
the new free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1

it also has excellent views of the city through our two story house	1
this is extemely lame	0
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does not come in the overused blue	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
it is invisible and dissapears in your pocket	1
you can see the top of the barrel in the view finder	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
deficiencies with zennx are easy to overcome with rd party earphones and software	0

in the opinion of someone who does nt it will yield good results on the computer it will program auto mode	1
after a while it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
this is the third apex product i ve used in the past year and they continue to impress for the price	1
the color screen is very good and this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1

but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
the price is very good	1
unit failed and then video output failed	0
without a doubt i don t care at all if the exposure is low or high the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
what is added in functionality vs what is lost in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
having usb makes for very fast data transfers	1
when the player was working it was great but	0

update the finish is more mirror like i wanted and i like it	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items are always in great shape	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0

i dont like the automatic key lock function	0
they are very sturdy and have no trouble with bending or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about a month now and i am very happy with it	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
the colors and textures are great	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
it does have a lense cap but it does nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
months of hard work and it no longer recognizes anything	0
some people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to get to the next page you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
these speakers are available	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was free	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally worth it	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
overall i like the unit	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that may arise	1
just received this camera two weeks ago and already love the features it has	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
technical support was slow and unhelpful	0
it would spin read spin read read read and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a lot of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be very useful	1
otherwise this player is unavailable	0
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
after months it has started playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
the whole thing is a little hard to understand	0
instead	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
i think i like the unit	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd version	1
it delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
to my amazement even that one was error prone	0
nice machines but i would say their quality pretty low now	0
the problem with this box is that it has to be opened several times an hour if not more frequently	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
and it works great too	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the system is also very flexible	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
way less expensive than the alternatives	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base doesnt work properly and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
second the touch screen navigation system and controls are poorly designed	0
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
the software which comes with player is not very good at all	0
linux has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for money on a variety of different sites	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
we got to the end and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the phone is well made and very attractive	1
wo nt have a lot of discs	1
this app is the best i have used to date	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
however when i am listening to them i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i love this player	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is fast enough that you ll forget entirely about the issues	1
i got this for a test drive on my truck and i have to say i am very happy with it for the most part it is loud and it is easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
for the price it is a very good investment	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just didnt work	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
at ounces it is pretty light compared to the ipad but not as light as the ipod	1
other than that the picture is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
but canon never ceases to amaze	1
the remote control works for a while but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
i found it very useful as a tool for transferring large files to another computer	1
easy to use with clear instructions on how to install contained in the install drive	1
but this camera is great	1
i love this player	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this is the first time i have easily met and surpassed my needs	1
my only significant complaint is	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
my pizza is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not play in order they play one after another like on a cd	0
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
but i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a situation like setting one where you don t want to be heard and only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
and man i had to work to put my favorite chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as well as the title	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and for docs is more than acceptable	1
the best thing about this monitor is the stand	0
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using usb	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing a thumbs up for great sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the lack of bass which i have with my nd generation ipod nano	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the macro mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
the second set is working well	1
this camera has a	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the manual	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
so far the router is working	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the light	0
on dvds so i cant get it to work it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
the phone is sound quality is good and i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
newbies will find that the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
i cant believe the size and weight of this little critter	0
i am going to miss my phone a lot	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the lenses and optics	1
also the plastic case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a hard disk read next the ultimate travel guide for the nomad	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in the monitor to be seen from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not be able to fit in	1
the world	0
i am extremely pleased with this router	1
the next day i tried to connect to it on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
i will never buy a creative writing book again	0
the daylight pictures are very good and the indoor shots are very very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
your health is fine	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
it is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little more more	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the customer service is excellent	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
when the player said it was great but	0
i found the controls very intuitive and i was able to figure out how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
also the lens cap on this lens is flawed	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly complained about i m sure the problems will be fixed over time but i have room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems	1
fragile	0
criminal justice reform seems to be a major problem	0
speakerphone	1
the battery life is good	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
simply the canon eos d mark ii is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
how this apex dvd player turned out great	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for me	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good this phone is	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
the camera is a dream to use as it not only shoots in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work with our dvd players and none worked	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent game	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the right side of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly purchased nvidia glasses	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands are in the way even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
usb	1
they were supposed to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
it is versatile and has the potential to be one of the best	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard hdmi port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the technology used could be better designed	0
the speakerphone works so much better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
this was not a standard shipping service	0
the remote is a little hard to find	0
i got this for my birthday and for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
main dial is not backlit	0
i think it is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
i just set it up on my computer which is very easy	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load all of my music onto this unit	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their app	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at this price point i did not find anything that would justify the huge difference in price	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
months of use and it no longer does anything	0
i am ripping my cd collection into mb files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory i have thanks for listening to me	1
this is one of the nicest phones that nokia has made	1
seriously i am	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
bought the gb version of this book a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
so i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware atdd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
what a day	1
the phone has a few problems but only because it lacks those things like bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
the eax sound was great but the eq feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	1
now that i have been able to work on it there has nt been any more problems	1
too difficult to change genre or track information for large number of tracks	0
the quality is excellent	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise i was able to play the cheep media that i had burned that i	1
the features are really cool like this	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i expected	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have access to them as they evolve	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
maybe it is my lack of experience but i find the quality of my shots with this camera very disappointing	0
first of all my calls were answered unlike with sprint	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i have to say i am extremely pleased with it	1
image camera	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
the color is red and is very bright	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
the light auto correction system	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with the help of a timer which can t be stopped	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in the back of the house the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
living in a tiny apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line was very helpfulthe buffalo technical service linewas very helpful	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
nothing else	0
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
lots of sound effects and it has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
the first night i had it i had to have it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its just so light and feel so comfy with it	1
these speakers are available	1
this is a list	0
the problem for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its cheap	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is a bit bulky and it would be better if it came with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it was a bit slow between shots	0
i get to chapter and everything is fine	1
i think this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time to recognize them and then concludes no disc	0
great quality picture and features	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well but now i have dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
i ve had the pleasure of playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
its ability to serve as a sort of back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
this is one of the most beautiful books that i ve ever owned	1
the screen goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that can interfere with viewing at night its a shame	0
all in all this is a great deal for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
the progressive scan option can be turned on and off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
the fight against the poor design continues with the case	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
the damage is staggering	0
the results are amazing	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and expensive but the fact that they exist tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	1
overall an excellent phone	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a while for you to collect on the warranty	0
i m not very happy with it	0
sound effects are amazing and base is amazing	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
this was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and updates very good battery life good price	1
cons i think i look ugly	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete list of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to the main menu	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i love it	1
all in all bad product and bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
this phone is also one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
no way to complain about their customer service	1
this has taught me that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the problems came from my old credit card	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it take pictures but it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
honestly i love this player	1
best electronic i ve played since i was born	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total change in him and this is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do is job	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it was based on which only lasted months	1
works really easy	1
great price	1
after a long wait one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the zen stores data files but does not store them in a folder structure nor does it have a file system that allows documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
vocals have been working with the ihome as well	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
the camera battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1

the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i ve sent e mails to a number of people requesting an ra with no response	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0

everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the zen sound is great and sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1

as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
i paired this app on to two different android phones	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way it could be inserted	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a very compact size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes songs based on id tags and excellent sound	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
bright visible light	1
the keys are laid out on the table so there is no guessing	1
you have to press all the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0

the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1

sub woofer subwoofer	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
going through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party adapter on the net that is compatible	0
it really impressed me with the quality and the price	1
when you turn on your player the player will turn on automatically and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
so if you re game for a good weather day you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would not let me do it	1
overall i like the system i have and performance	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
creative zen is a great product but suffers from a poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks now	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the app on my phone plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
replacement battery is compared to	1
also the lens cap on this lens is flawed	0
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
there are	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt worry about it i got this after first day	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
on my main computer it just did not work right	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference with the speakers	0
this feature is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be very helpful enjoy	1
the quality of the screen is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a group of children playing with an elderly group	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not just limited to creative is products it applies to all the company is products	0

sound quality and base is amazing	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is too small and does not work well	0
last night i needed to reset the router	0

the quality is superb	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and set up a sophisticated flash unit	1
i t	0

it also has a very nice calculator built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1

apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
the sound is awesome but if u play it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
some features in the user interface	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good for the price and the quality is very good i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are the same	0
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
this is a great deal for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
i think the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times https www amazon com gp product b a c f y ref	0
the auto setting does a great job for most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
most products will last if taken care of and the truth is products are made to last my new speakers are exceptions to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot d to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the picturers are amazing	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it said it would nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
player has a dvd player with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
the more i play around with it the more i love it	1
a replaceable battery	1
the player is intuitive and easy to use with great sound quality	1
because this camera is awesome	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the end	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
it is running great for what i have and i love it	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars out of five because of its affordability	1
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0

i did not managed to make it to work	0
my first impression was good	1
the black fly wheel on the left is uncomfortable to use	0
it may	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer works	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a good sound system with both internal and external speakers	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily accessible without taking your eyes off the road	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature called the speakerphone	1

only if we could fit more than one camera in it	0

the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
overall i m not too worried about this stars as i ve seen nothing of the sort with the other players i have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i have only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone	1
the top that covered the bottom of the door kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
and it holds sooooo much more	1
p it is not lite on weight so it is a bit heavy but i definately recommend it to anyone out there	1
the scroll button is a little too sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on how to install it on my computer downloads for apple computers	0
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
i have not yet had any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
the set up is more efficient and offers a superior result	1
too difficult to search for genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid name they come up with it is rrb power adapter	0
what a day	1
also you can store all your music on the ipod which is great for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipods do nt have to actually use it this is a much better buy	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
what a sweet machine	1
poor visibility on the road	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays to be very useful	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb the bass is even better than expected rrb	1
the rate plans are also pretty good at least for me	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
the sound quality is excellent except that it can get a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
i was very happy to find that not only could it play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play the vob files which i created with smart ripper and the dvd	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well thought out controls that can be learned quickly	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
for the most part i still think its a great phone	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a definite plus	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can live with that	1
if you want a quality product delivered to your door buy this one	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
on the up side is that the phone has amazing battery life	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of the customer service rep who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one on the website says the customer support rep is probably extremely overworked	0
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use and with well thought out controls that can be learned quickly	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge the battery	1
the included usb cable is very comfortable and easy to use	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
then my dvds would stop working in the middle or not even be read at all	0
died very soon after getting them	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
when the next version of the dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m going to be very happy with my purchase	1
i am so tired of what i feel is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
the zennx will keep running for the rest of your life without the need of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
now there is only one complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was to set it up to shoot with a m	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different technology is used in the zx than ipod more expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is involved in the zx	1
i t	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
it is the best bang for the buck out there	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features make this player the best on the market	1
they fired away and it all turned out quite nicely	1

the sound quality is	1
canon is g	0
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt think i will have any problems with it	1
i have had no luck with the phone	0
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour on the speaker i was sold	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i took	1
the samsung galaxy s is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
the light in the correction is awesome	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
it is light enough to be carried around all day without bother	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my computer but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
even leaving it on the default setting will result in crystal clear playback	1
great features	1
my other complaint is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information on the screen when you zoomed down into the screenwhen you are in zoom mode	0
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
this is the best dvd player i have	1
takes place	1
i am really impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks and feels great the screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
seems to read most dvds fine and watch them quietly	1
setup was very easy	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an excellent multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
the only downside is the fact that its a camera which requires a line of sight	0
it wo nt ndihm n	0
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
i will never forget	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
but this one is great	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the mp file on a portable cd and the zen xtra sounds great on a mp player	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams that i use	1
the amount of money which comes with player is not good at all	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than they actually are	0
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very well for those who are looking for a computer speaker rrb this is not necessary	0
the case is too small it took me about a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
i am able to keep it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
both the black and the white speakers are very good well priced and worth it	1
easy to hook up	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize the disc and takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i think this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	0
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
even better you do nt have to pay for it	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
besides i lufton	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can just take the camera with you and not have to worry about taking too many pictures of them	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
ipod x battery life hours beats ipod is	0
it wo be able to play all of my movies	0
the excels as a cell phone is a god	1
overall i do it	1
the device itself is not	0
avoid it like the plague	0
the sound quality is very good and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
the prints are beautiful	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image processing software and the settings in the camera	0
unfortunately it turned out to be the disposable type	0
for a small portable music player this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
for instance i made several back ups of my movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with the results	1
awesome camera with huge print and a ton of features in a tiny package	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
i loved the look of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
the store would not close	0
even leaving it on produces crystal clear playback	1
it is very easy and simple to navigate around in this device	1
overall it is one of the best on the market	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i try to view them on my monitor	0
well it was fun while it lasted	1
on average they are not quite as good as they used to be	0
audio is unavailable	0
it worked really well for about a week then the problems came	1
the biggest problem with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem	0
i s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
otherwise known for its price	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
these are perfect for my needs	1
it is extremely light and easy to carry in your pocket	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is out there	1
this router is the best router i have used to date	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to charge the camera while plugged in so you dont have to worry about	1
the design is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
no propietary and no jack	0
the set up is simple and offers a superior result	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to get the speakers the day i got them	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am very happy and satisfied with the purchase	1
the appearance is okayed	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its slow shutter speed will cause you to miss precious shots	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat screen tv with such horrible viewing angles	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
i have excellent speakers on my phone but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the apex has been a very good performer for me	1
a hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
it was worth the wait because this is standout monitor has all this and more	1
transfers are very quick through usb	1
slow to download and run certain programs i wish all of you the best and hope my review helped	0
lots of flaws but exceptional build quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the keys are a bit small and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
easy to use a lot of reviews has been written about this	1
audio files can not be created for the audio files	0
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
having spent considerable time with my laptop i find onscreen displays annoying	0
door code	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy sound quality which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
so far the router has worked well	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
c i do have an audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	0
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
like other reviewers said it was hell	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but it is worth noting that the zen version of the game is not deficient in this matter	1
material support	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt worry about it i got this after first day	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
the speakerphone works better than any i ve ever had	1
the router i used was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
however shareport on this new router is disabled most of the time	0
this is the best phone i have ever used	1
the cover that came with it did nt look good	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful design	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
i think that the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
well on keypad	1
this thing is great i like to use it to clean up tough stains on my clothes and also to listen to my old track records	1
battery life is ok	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider buying one more of these super cards	1
the included items were uncomfortable	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just head on to canon is website	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
the picturers are here	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down on the idea for t mobile as a carrier	0
the only two minor issues i have with the lens and the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the netbook i bought came as a breeze for my sales person it works fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my old netbook so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt sound like you are in the middle of a disturbance	1
the memory is staggering	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
i selected the right away and have gotten a new set of pictures every time	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a while for you to collect on the warranty	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve ever had	1
the interface is good but could be better designed	0
this is an excellent value	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
second the menu system and controls are very well designed	1
the ringtones i got are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
i did not get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
i just had to suck it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
this wonderful little box was easy to unbox and install	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
the pictures are pretty good even in macro	1
it was worth the wait because ag is amazing and this is standout monitor has all this and more	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are usually very clear and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you are packing it up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
typically the problem is that it isnt but it was for me and many others	0
worked out	1
the menu options are a bit confusing as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
very good range and seemed to be in a good place in the horizontal position	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
unfortunately the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to get to the display its a shame	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for the price	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc easily enough	1
i m not very happy with this but i cant do anything or acer	0
the pictures are so amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
and it is	1
the in program id tag editing is a good starting point as well	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
another point of note is that he is incredible	1
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
i love being in this thing	1
instead	0
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
i m glad canon has been able to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short space of time mentioned	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does take up a lot of space the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
they caused the problem ie wrong software was installed in the box the service tech failed to fix the problem because what the software said was wrong	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share music with friends and family in an intimate setting	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
it does not interfere in all aspects of internet browsing	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
i simply love this feature	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
the only issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
very easy to set up	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive piece of luggage which you can take anywhere	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
the player usually plays the movie as it is but has occasional problems such as not being able to play a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we try to play it or sometimes not be able to access certain special features	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely is the best i have ever used and a huge bang for the buck	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i ve been very happy	1
in short if you are just a guy that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this is the router for you and it is	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
so far i really like this player and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality mp player but also anyone who want a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
well within days the video output was working	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have not had to re set the router at all so far since it has been installed so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her	1
i m easily able to set my pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
overall small sounds great and the only thing worse than apple is overpriced ipod	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
very simple to use	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
received apex dvd and the picture was good even when set up with s connector	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the songs that i put in it	0
some movies it played yesterday it played today	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is too small and difficult to operate	1
however shareport on this new router worked of course	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
the canon computer software used to download and upload and manage your digital pictures on the internet is very nice and very easy to use	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the customer service is excellent	1
the usb port on the back is a very nice feature	1
mixed feelings i guess but the price was right	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt work on some computers	0
i did nt abuse it i used it a lot but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
sometimes the router would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player so i think that might have been just the batteries that came with it	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
my first reaction was positive	1
easy to use a lot of people have said and has mentioned about this	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
they do look cool as hell though	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
great value gb for gbgreat value for the price	1
overall this is a good device however it suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the food is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
nikon i mikrofoni i makrofoni is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
this product does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
what a disappointment	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item as it saves me from lugging all my stuff from the gym to work to the gym in the car etc	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
my house is small so it is hard to get the real feel of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
i got it for my iphone and i have to say it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get	1
this company has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0

this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
full spectrum sound is back to great highs	1
the fact that there is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the root cause of the problem which was that the d link driver failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a new car just like any other battery powered appliance	1

it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
and with usb transferring files from your computer to your player is incredibly easy	1
the big backlight makes it easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
one complaint the screen is too small	0
the stock is on the cheap side	0

the dvd player is	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0

i really love you	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is very good as well	1
although the phone is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was designed to do and what it is meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1

not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
there was also a lip sync issue	0

the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the picture editing software it comes with is adequate but not very robust	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1

the internet is useless	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work the one time before	0

i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to be able to answer their emails and telephone number is listed as the one lonely customer service number i think the rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1

i bought this laptop as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change my mind as soon as possible	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1

the display is bright enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about any of the other issues	1
protective case completely useless as is as it obscures display window	0

these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the volume turned up	1

i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned the app before	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
range of functions as indicated above it has all the basic functions for everyone point and shoot camera plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
i think this is it for me	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is very attractive	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the shot when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0

i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be ignored	0
i have been ripping songs into it for a while now and the ease of use is wonderful	1
the changing colors help to tell the time with a quick glance	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i tried as many as i could of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
the link to the player does not work properly	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is using for her work so she needed to have something that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1

this phone is very good and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
for a specific location i still dont know	0
fortunately for me the metz ct has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already have a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the met z ct	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic sound effects	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1

the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1

what is added in functionality vs what is lost in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices a major achievement for a hard drive based player	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
the size is small	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to download them	0
the labeling of the product itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
however once you crank the volume up a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the sound quality is great lrb well this is the best i have heard for	1
it is a great camera for beginners to use but has features that more experienced photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
avoid this one like the plague	0

even viewed cds full length	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth on a laptop but it is also eye candy	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and connecting to them was a breeze	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0

unit worked great for a while but then video output failed	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1

you have to nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
it will read and play the entire all cd audio disc	1
it has a good speed and range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1

d link does not have mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
there is an alarm i can set on my phone i have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1

i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the settings and i was shocked to find that the game is actually ruining my media	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
focusing on a display that was about feet away in a brightly lit room during a time when most of the time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said that you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and class that i have ever used	1
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely happy with the purchase	1
my wife is even more pleased with it due to its widescreen	1

i can t rate it one star only because when it comes to the story it is pretty good	0
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there cost wise	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was a bug in the firmware or if it is a fault of the router	0
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
this led to	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want to	1
the camera battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to use the g to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no information	0
it allows the usb interface of the printer to be used either for nas or print server	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything set up	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise that can be encountered in a car or on a plane	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
its a bit difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly music creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does not have a lot of features sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
got a system error problem about a week after purchase	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was a breeze	1
i was a little surprised to see it in the low end	0
while my laptop and netbook have built in speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
it has never worked	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
no games it has a big screen why not use it	0

the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just doesnt seem to work it does nt load on some computers	0
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1

these monitors are great for the price	1

when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and light it is so light	1
storage space	1

only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only turn on the speakers and use the microphone and the speakerboom feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is on	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious users will love so it is a great tool to grow into	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with other products	1
unfortunately i had to buy a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
door broke after a month	0
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule and i have no doubt that they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1

made call which was immediately taken care of by very helpful competent tech	1
i did not install on my personal notebook	0
very long lasting battery life	1
i really like the quality of the pictures	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the room fills out and fills outs exceedingly well	1

the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings for portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc etc	1
awesome camera with huge print quality and low noise	1
progressive scan player for android	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i think i like it	1
very easy to set up	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are clear	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to use	1
other then that it is very good for the price	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
the screen is very bright and easily read	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
great value gb ipod for the pricegreat value great gb i	1
i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region codes and destroyed all of my dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling for this product at lrb price depression due to poor quality of the product and no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
this product is too strong for normal use	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them quickly	1
it also means	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are hard to beat and even excel the ipod	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
all in all it is very easy to use	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint as most windows users do nt generally use firewire cards themselves	0
i have now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
i was so happy i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	1
the eax mode that allows you to keep the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is fine	1
ripping the songs off is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
the noise cancelling earbuds were uncomfortable	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without any warning and there was a bit of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
for the most part this is a very good dvd player	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this list to be quite disturbing	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you left the room	1
i m giving this player cautious praise	1
unfortunately after a few months of downloading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
turning to the camera	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
the system is very similar to the ipod in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	0
i was hoping that acer was nt more helpful	0
it is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
nokia and t mobile really need to team up well on this baby	0
great product works perfectly for my needs	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
but after days it still worked but the video quit working	0
but this camera is better	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving i thought they were awesome	1
unfortunately after loading the game all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
and with usb transferring music to and from your computer is incredibly easy	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
this is by far the best camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
i would highly recommend this product	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling trip	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it is very stable and has a good signal strength	1
but within days the video output quit working	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the earbuds that come with it are not that bad	1
despite its being smaller than the ipod i have i have to say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
i like the flash but as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
for the price and size and features you can t get anywhere else for the price	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city and state in the map	0
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated if you dont do it quickly	0
nice and all	1
i am very happy with this product and i thought the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
it allows the user interface on the router to be used either for a web browser or print server	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
it was a snap to set up and my ps ps ps netbook eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
upon first looking at these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
it looks good sounds good and does everything it claims	1
proven canon errors	0
i have been calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
this is the only remote control that will not work with my universal remote control	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on the router button on the front of the router to get it to work because the gui one would nt work	0
i m not happy with this product	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
i found using the mediasource to load the songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
the apex has been a very good performer for me	1
my only complaint is like others here it sometimes disconnects from the bluetooth and it is a little annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is still not really robust despite what others have said though not as bad as some others and may still work better	0
it plays basically every media i ve ever bought so far even an old vcd that i ve never seen before and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
games kind of stink and you ca not be able to download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0

it is not	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
what really made this a great mp player for me was the software	1
i needed three batteries to charge the g and i found myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
the software for this is pretty good	1
but with a higher price comes lower quality	0
it is slightly lighter than the previous model and packed with even more features	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous error page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
volume level is	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
i started accessing and transfering files to the server and found it to be extremely slow	0
the mms technology is also integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make the color of display either list or tabbed	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
the functionality on this camera is limited	0

it was already there and we just plugged it in	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
plusses are the ability to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does have a few quirks	1
well the theory was good but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
after using it for just a month i noticed that it does not play any dvd	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
images in this post were nt so clear	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for a while and then it died	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it also has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
it also has a great feel and weight to it	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
hooked up to the d link extreme speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mpshooked to thed link extreme connection dropped to	0
just an average user getting good value in the end	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the battery life is great this is by no means a major advantage over the ipod	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
the service from t mobile is free too	0
for the most part it is a very nice dvd player	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
fragile	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
the build quality is top notch	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw dvd l rw and dvd w rw	1
i am not to savy with a computer but i have found that it is very easy to install and set up	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
it also does nt have an activated dialing big minus	0
nice little phone light compact	1
they are all very easy to use	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward clickthe camera has a little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i love the bass this thing has and i have a ton of bass in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use with a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least it has received	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things like the soundstage is really big and the blue light on the top is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering it is a great sound	1
this guy is phenomenal	1
the software failed to work	0
i lost them very shortly after getting them	0
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
a week out of the box and i began to see my name pop up on top of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	1
it did also seem to have a strong smell of burnt electronics smell for some time	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is to be expected because all i really want is something to work with my iphone	0
i ve sent e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
software is easy to use	1
i m also a believer in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this type of wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
the battery is nice	1
best of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
this router is broken	0
this is a toy and what a toy it is	0
i ve had it for about a year now and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
paid more than what amazon is currently charging me for this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random price drops kills it for me	0
the camera has a number of features	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to work with you	0
one other plus is that napster now has the ability to control this device via their software	1
i just purchased this phone and i have to say this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be turned off	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the price is also not as high as i would have expected	0
i am enjoying it a lot	1
i like the nomad is a bit better but it is not terribly flashy	1
it has never worked	0
it is made of	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to see how it would feel in my hand i listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a single camera	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in low light	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down over a grand for an ipod	1
it does not have an auto focus assist feature which is nice for taking photos in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in light but it is not as good as the sony	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen and zen gb is the software	0
the device itself is pretty solid	1
good range of	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of different colors and de focused text	0
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
i would like	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took me over an hour to get through to their customer service dept	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
also navigating while playing music is a lot easier unlike my previous player	1

this router does drop every once in a while but not as much as the old router did every hour or so	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up most of the screen and the user has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
these are the best places for the weekend cycling in the park	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in them and you can t avoid that	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
the person on the other end of the call said	0
so that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
quite simply the system is broken and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
the software is very intuitive and easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
awesome sound system	1
it has a touchscreen and is loaded with features	1
these guys are incredibly amazing	1
back buttons click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
loading the app on my phone was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0

due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just bought the bare bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
bought the gb version of this book a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1

even with these shortcomings i still think it is a great game it is available under	1
i ve also had the nomad zen guy show up several times	1

headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
great picture	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely out of date and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
the battery is alot better than most of the other phones out there	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets a little bit better	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
it is very solidly built and has a very solid feel to it	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0

i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack is still missing	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
cons i mbrojtjes	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
i find this to be a very useful feature	1
it is very easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
possibly the biggest advantage that this player has is the fact that she can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
mr trump is trash	0
the interface was atrocious and some of the elements simply did nt work at all	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than ipod but ipod is overpriced ipod	1
portable	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an easy to use interface i also liked the fm phone and earpiece	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why they would introduce static	0
the link does not work properly	0
i negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1

the sound that came from the speakers sounded like carnegie hall	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
i will never use all the whistles and bells and whistles this machine is capable of	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too high the sound is a bit harsh for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in a long time lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
sub woofer is a	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
i like the way it is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
very convenient to scroll in menu bar	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am quite impressed at the range of choices i have there too	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
nothing when trying to get service from apex court	0
but with higher prices comes lower quality	0
finally downloading the playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are linked to	0
it is great to be able to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
great minds	1

they are not wowable good	0
this router is phenomenal	1
this camera was affordable very easy to use and produces spectacular images	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support calls	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
all in all bad device bad customer service and i will run like hell from this product	0
this page	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see what you re looking for instead of having a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you ve been looking for	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
i like the system features and performance	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were nice to have but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is not the best but it is fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
size bigger than this	0
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say this is a bad thing but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i finally gave up and stuck with mediasource	0
i do nt know what other people are doing with this but the software is awesome	1
no propietary headset jack	0
nice to have them back but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
easy to read	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
in all i d say that this is a decent router for the money	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0

when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
and really this is the best phone one can buy	1
also it was very easy to set up a route on my new netgear as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1

no changes to the format	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with the front speakers	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
it would read read read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
my life is ok	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
not possible as the play relies on i d no fm or recording	0
price	1

it did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
it takes about an hour to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
screen brightness edit	0
not a bad monitor for but it is not the best	1
great graphics great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked really well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or twice a week or so	1
the team is top notch	1

however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to slow it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer would not connect to the internet in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be compromised	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and speakers	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0

there are lots of interesting features included in it	1
the problem is mechanics are also flawed	0

looks like a very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
great phone i d buy now	1
the flowers are beautiful	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1

n the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
additional features	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0

my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0

there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
i have been playing this game and had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0

usb drive is insanely fast	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i need this monitor	0
i keep trying and it keeps telling me no disc	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i think the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
sound quality is good	1
i think the software is crap	0
best in class sound	1
well it is	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
you will need to install nomad explorer first and then use it to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it this is not the case	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
the computer used for data processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the inside pics can be a little blurry but when you can instantly delete pics that you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
the price performance looked just right	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1

x zoom zoom	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
the combination of photo capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this site	1
it is very difficult to navigate around in this device	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really much that the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten used to it and comfortable with it	0
i thought the software was decent enough it was just a bit too complicated to learn at all	1
looks like my esp w iphone docked	0
it may	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two most popular online retailers and they both delivered great results	1
with mediasource being the only option i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
in fact i would say not bright enough	0
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
i love that it is a touch screen and it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1

when it works its great to have but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard keyboards and some of the keypads but it is not too weird	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open it	1
the setup process for the game is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
does not provide enough volume when compared to larger headphones or external receivers	0
a pocket protector that is extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for quality and clean images	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel or maybe a pushbutton	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
neither message received	0
user replaceable user	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
im happy everything seems to work well	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no explanation but it will play them on the others on the dvd	0
that is true	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
they look fantastic	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image of the letter looked normal	0
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with it	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the canon eos d mark ii	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
it would have been a lot nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
i think this is great for me	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable kind	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but i guess everyone elses is too	0

ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
it looks like a work of art its beautiful	1
the usb type c port on the back is a nice feature	1
fragile	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
neither message was answered	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
do nt ndodh	0
raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image processing settings in the camera the raw image for this article is shown below	0
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my car when i was in the car and not out on the street	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from the internet	1
however if speed reliability and the ability to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
the design of the phone is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
