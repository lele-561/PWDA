its far heavier and have to carry it around a bit of a pain to carry much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
there are limitations limitations of the to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
their network coverage seems to be is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
this software is absolutely terrible	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you set it up ve gotten comfortable with it	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of and functions the apps the features is great	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
another nice thing is that is that you should check the price of the unit the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d one thing to note scanned before buying	1
however some of the slow latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point i had lost where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim the bandwidth a dropped internet connection	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1

the screen very bright is large and easily read	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display the screen and of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the middle of the screen which is nice but there is always a bit of a gap in the screen and of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the phone screen the screen a bit of that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
this is by far the nicest one ive seen in so many ways	1
even viewed cds full if its of jpgs	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that one of the reasons it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the catch sony a with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
but if you re looking for my opinion can vouch for it of the apex dvd player i love it	1
the screen is easily scratched but fine if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0

not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is also better what i have	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
not plug play relies on i d no i d fm fm or recording	0
i ve sent e mails to their customer service department requesting customer service department requesting an explanation for the delay but with no respons an ra with no response	0

excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into fit the rest of my furniture	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
the manual is easy to understand and it easy to read is mostly idiot proof	1
one c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt and not very sturdy survive a drop	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around have a lot of friends also very and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
the menus are easy to the user interface and settings are easy us navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
this player seems well to work fine with everything else	1

the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
when talking the voice is the person speaks not very clear	0
the sound quality is sound really good	1
not a good idea as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if gear in the case you load up all your songs beforehand	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as others the ipod	1
scroll button down switch	0
the rate plans are also very good at the moment least for me	1
the only minor nits a bit hard to get a good balance i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck to be carried with a strap strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0

it is also a bit bigger than expected a little more space for it but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0

what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at teams i know of that has that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
connection speed to the speed other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1

if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital great deal on a camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
the canon g gives the average person tons of control for photo buffs easy to use but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1

the service from the supplier to the customer was exceptional	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
the same as the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1

overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
the sound that came this from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is noting is the fact not deficient in this matter	1

their network coverage is seems to be very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0

quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid to power the device and is as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
i only have is too small one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
the controls a bit are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but gotten i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not a little more complicated think would justify the huge difference in price	0
megapixels is enough for anybody and quality the photo quality is awesome	1

and really this is for the price the best phone one could have	1

others may have better luck may be right but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
get it it is woth if you can afford every penny	1
however the creative software is not the interface of real intuitive	0

forget about the sleek looks if it can t play it s not all some of your real dvds	0
your pocket when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1

the instructions that in the box come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
the macro works great for medical photographs a great option and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
so far the router far i think has worked well	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1

unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and to fix it i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt but i recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
very well and i was able to use it in all rooms and corners wit my house is small so it is hard my house to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product product worke worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with options and it the options	1
the camera has a wonderful set a number of features	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
technology progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
but anyway is so cheap the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for thing i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyt processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix response that it for me if necessary	1
recommend i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
on my main computer the software did not work at all right	0
no matter the format	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
it looks great feels great great and is loaded with features	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
storage space capacity	1
my only significant complaint is the key sound quality	0
the fm radio app is cool	1
for those be creative of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend this book to recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the software is not good either and the annoying driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the nd dvd the dvd player to player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
i love the storage one in this thing	1
they had a great time fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are very reasonable unbeatable	1
good the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
the speakerphone the radio all features are available work perfectly	1
i purchased bought this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when rrb on my laptop i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
selected i bought it because it looked easy to install	1
the router recognized my wireless other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	0
having usb makes a better life for very fast transfers	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
poor visibility keep your fingers on the keys	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean watching a movie back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
volume is level is ok	1
since it would not did work as advertised i called support	0
the remote is flimsy feeling the keyboard and awkward to use	0
bought the gb xtra weeks a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
only thing creativity missing from creative is a cd burner	0
would say however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can a good idea at the time not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i my friends am very pleased	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
the case is strong and stylish compelling but unfortunately lacks a strong defense but unfortunately lacks a window	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to make it easy for miss precious shots	0
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and life great sound quality great downloadable java apps	1
worth for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
well within days the video output was restored quit working	0
update jan the device has worked flawlessly stem for the past year	1
i ve student viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
the controls need on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity data you need for your music collection	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job dont think i would be that most people want them for	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and whole thing put some rubber on the corners	0
only con i can think of is thing that no camera	0
nothing but hassle the best with this company	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for focus feature point and shoot	1
dr johns awesome sound system	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had using been using for years	0
we for the job i was doing as far as got this on time and am not the only one to use this so my opinion comes t it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
the dvd player is does not work properly	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
software that the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter conversion and a stopwatch	1
in comes addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
listen to other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
the volume range is great so you can blast on this it if you want	1
and really this is the best phone christmas present one could have	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and camera and a very good useful little camera	1
this was an awesome player was removed because it before the video output no longer worked	0
i gave it out of due only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance from a fairly short distance	0
creative are the sound people want to work with for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
same story as everybody else last time when trying to get service from apex court when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
the player has firmware which will remove the option to play the game the glitches if there are any	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention mention that they were polyphonic	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection going well sporadically	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and support having just dropped the bones for this router i was unable to use it very unimpressed	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs the phone will only work through t mobile is services because network they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used network on a different network	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the been using the enclosed software on my pc i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
if you have netbook expectations you will performs be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable also although it does take some getting used to	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
however back in when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the price for the money	1
very easy easy to set up	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit works with it it worked well when i set it the radio on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but much i only use it for occasional use backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent a great camera fm phone and earpiece	1
the moveable lcd screen also available is great	1
the with the video problems came from my video card	0
the size is a little bit bigger a little than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
very good range in a good place and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the instructions that come with it do nt use it explain how to make things simple	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is that the stand	0
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
lot i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa has worked out and it worked almost perfectly	1
definitely this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer the trouble your old phone book to this phone saved me hours had of re entering my numbers	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
bookmarks for example are available on this page an excellent feature but not on this player	0
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided were able to walk me through the process without a problem	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
it really impressed me are with the disign the specs the price	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0

it also costs a lot less other options than the ipod	1
the computer direct processing from the manufacturer and shipping was outrageously fast	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any reviews problems this phone but i think it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the bo right out of the box	1
works this camera has a major design flaw	0

print small size	1
first of all my calls were loud and and clear unlike with sprint	1
no fm receiver it has none	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull the once you actually got someone	1
finally making playlists from the download and playing the playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized downloading and playing a playlist from the itunes store can be very easy but downloading playing and listening to the songs fro computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized downloading and playing the playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by genre except for the tracks which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical orde by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so is the world the smaller much the better	1

the canon g digital slr is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1

this machine is a replacement for for your desktop	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0

there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1

i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go it down one single bar	1
the auto focus performs well but i would love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof the camera and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	0
i ncercat am quite happy with the camera	1
the size the world is small	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their support the fact that companies that offer customer willingness ability to support their customers and their to stand behind them	0
height there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1

my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most as most windows users do nt generally use firewire cards themselve windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
the minor phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you would expect from a high end phone and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that wi fi are included in this phone you expecte that wi fi are included in this phone you expected this phone to do	0

you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it button that can be used to adjust the focus that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is toug has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
looks like you can see so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player how many songs with room for about more	1
as a non technical person i an hour was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1

however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on sound quality with the sound turned up	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
it to be placed the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
what types of makes the focus lock lag time something i can on this live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1

i got it today it works great i have to say that it is a little bit small for its size and price but i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed a great great sound for its size and price but i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
even works better on g f band than the linksys	1
as well one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0

the interface used the technology could be better designed	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am bored disapointed	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make adjust that big of a disturbance	1
the combination of the price storage size and the quality of the software player features makes this player the best on the market	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0

sure it i think is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0

it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air air circulation	0
the possibilities with auto manual a wide range of and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized awareness the possibilities of the camera situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely very light into my tv stand	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can a very easy to use ap instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly need to worry about that the ability to delete pics or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0

i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the battery was getting low and the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
door closed broke after a month	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the sound level is also not the price as high as i would have expected	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
what a day disappointment	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and shutter had been pressed and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter the camera had been released a few seconds	0
i have over files in my playlist at t the moment the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	0
lots of flaws of noise but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1

a problem it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the camera so you dont have to worry about running down the battery but the charging system also enables you t smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i editing the started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
however my hard drive did fail and hard i have not dropped it once	0
but about you ever noticed that of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture i play will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
however since i am in an office i listen to normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
my wife is even more pleased simplicity due to its widescreen	1
but if you ve used a slr mm easy camera the controls are very intuitive	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
i do nt think that really matters a few months though not i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
quality awesome sound system	1
it also has a stock tracking which you can invest app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
the headphone jack seems to be a issue major problem	0
i tried tried it out as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
the sound level is also not as high as i the price would have expected	0

as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
pretty good however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
else the colors and everything are great	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct bought a couple months ago and i have been very happy satisfied with it so far	1
the price is very good	1
i would strongly would recommend this product	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i seen have ever used	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
here even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
but tried when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
also it was only with a good deal free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures your computer the software on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
it is great to switch to lcd for the spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from very helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network to the router my fios optical network block	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents store them in to be opened or programs to the system be launched from its disk	0
only one knows con i can think of is no camera	0
made call which was immediately answered taken care of by very helpful competent tech	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined to be with the simplicity of the valet plus this faster makes for a great product	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional knows why instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter would not be able to work as the os does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
video output has stopped workin	0
it is very small looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
when talking the voice meaning of words is not very clear	0
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on used with or stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without this list a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
this product strong is too fragile for normal use	0
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound be ignored which can t be stopped	0
the steering light auto correction is awesome	1
the fm radio is a radio station cool	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera before and know how to use the the controls are very intuitive	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to the elements protect it against any damage	1
upon opening these i found them to be really good quality really small but having a solid feel to them	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like one on a cd	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the a number of issues including scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
i like the fact that they are m also running in of the stand wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
great camera the price and for the price you can t beat it	1
great value camera great investment	1
i tried calling the support phone number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying very nice for the return shipping	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
too short the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
it works flawlessly only during installation of the system during installation of cx	1
after multilple tries one were missing of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i needed bought it for admirably	1
the controls are like better on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is like better where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage feature to have over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
many great there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
it does not have an auto feature but it does have auto focus which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low traffi or low light conditionsit does have a focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	1
so slow that it up is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
i dont like like the automatic key lock function	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you recommend do nt purchase it	0
have i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
just received this camera two days ago it is amazing i and already love the features it has	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic get home when you open the drive	1
screen brightness the food is really good	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
say they look fantastic	1
the headphone jack seems to be lack of a a major problem	0
set thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
this has growth and you ll be able to adapt so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
the phone is as good excels as a cell phone thank god	1
the image sound quality is excellent	1
store the door would not close	0

software the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
what really made this a mediocre mp really player for me was the software	0
however once same with the other speakers but the sound quality is great lrb well thi you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola bit the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
the speakers perform very well and with the well bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
as a portable battery pack player it should feel a bit more durable	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
same story as everybody else when trying to on the phone get service from apex nothing	0
and why it creative labs customer support website is useless	0
does not recognize player enabled and displaying player is disabled at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
the speakers sound quality are nice sound quality no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
because of it dvd is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
sound quality may be off is good	1
this thing is trash	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets some issues five stars because of its affordability	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
however high for my taste bu once you crank the volume a little to was trying to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1

it looks great and is loaded with has a touchscreen features	1
yes the the features picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
only can vouch for the quality but owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
tech support from apex court is literally nonexistent	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know for what they were of for the price they were at rrb	1
this product is for me good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1

you can blame them the best service the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
however if speed reliability and power to so transmit large amount of data a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there even are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
range was comparable to even or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the price is right very good	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed very frustrating straight out of the box	0

i usually avoid horns but i do nt try to hear anything overly extreme	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there of giving you all the options are manual settings for those who want them	1
the color screen is speakers and the a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1

billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1

the dell phablet i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
this other things where we dont know what the we keep trying to figure it out and we think that maybe just maybe if we kept trying something it will work when it did not wor has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons want to say i wo nt say anything bad as you are are the price but just paying for this net book	1
range they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	1
when i took not outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
i have been ripping my heart out songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one so they were destroyed even dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0

because the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
this player is an candidate ideal purchase	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
is convenience because it works through the usb port	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature i need to back things when backing up from my various computers	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio line outputs though the latter was not mentioned in this the literature i d scanned before buying	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is the screen big enough for people to see	1
it surpasses the performance my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average very useful for these cameras	0
when you turn on your player music starts to play and the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left turn it off and you didnt even notice it when you were turning it off	1

my two got both main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
my favorite thing about the nomad this app is the eax feature	1
the eax features are the company has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train the results are pretty cool as well as a lot of fun pretty cool as well as creative to use the compan has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
very tight joints excellent black finish fit and and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
matter you can this level not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
this player is not worth any price and money i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is the first thing how good the screen is	1
i will never use thing all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0

i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would work would play and it did	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
you can do other different things with it old such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface changing the music or changing as modern or classical	1
the price was the this lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
the damage the memory is staggering	0
what disappointed me is really bothers the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
when it works different its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than capable any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills the room outs exceedingly well	1
nice to be very machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g use very comfortable and friendly to use	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better very similar to the ipod than the ipods	1
changed sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
however you do get what you you can be sure that pay for in reliable products	1
but after days the sound worked but still wasnt the video quit working	0
the player is of mechanics are also flawed	0

but i would still definately recommend this phone	1

it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
seriously i love it	1
i have been ripping songs trying to get a few into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
also i think navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party when i used it in longer did not leak as much lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a small hole a very clean look	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound portrait which can t be stopped	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0

i selected results the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size are good there is the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps expect even better than expected rrb	1

they caused the problem ie wrong n the box the tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong by puttin product in the box the service by putting the tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
very intuitive menus are a big plus camera settings and on this camera	1
the screen at it is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too enough long	1
there is an need to set alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
good better battery life	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to do things like drag wireless this wireless router to be seen in the ports to be actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
you ca nt can go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
it does not interfere well in all aspects of internet browsing	0
unfortunately it turns turned out to be the disposable type	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price better quality i found both	1

i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am even disapointed	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment the quality after the stainless steel heft of the s	0

the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0

without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
the volume range is great so want to you can blast it if you want	1
for team with a good the most part this is a good dvd player	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking the bass to spend on computer speakers	0
so all things that are yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player is boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on i great sound quality a compact d tags and excellent sound	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from not as bad a creative product	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before older model plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1

i getting am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never very impressed seen anything better within its resolution limits	1

i tried to contact apex to return it and it me over an hour took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i think this is without i ve seen	0
say they look fantastic	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is it the stand	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy the best deal out there for a large memory mp player	1
found i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound quality songs based sound	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i my laptop has always been a great machine however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a droppe was having to reset software was starting to bog it down to the point where i my laptop has always been a great machine however some of this latest software has been a bit of a letdown however som it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0

pros competitive hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great pros competitive win home premiu cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have used with or much more compact and the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
it never actually timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot it times in one hour lrb that i takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which reboot lrb i have n does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
what anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or working not even be read at all	0
i checked out am the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
they are not quite as good as they used to be on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
i also liked the fact that you the progress can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
it is the most bang for the buck the best bang out there	1
also the player sometimes freezes still not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
they sound they really good just as the reviews say	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0

after years customer with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity get to fit in its cage	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
girl because this camera is beautiful	1
this we have been told that has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
the customer support is very rude	0

they are clears and perfect to be used along with used in a boat a sub	1
price gb oil of storage	1
am starting a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also a great piece of also eye candy	1
replacement battery is compared to how mp ipod is	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never and customer recommend netgear products not giving me to anyone i know	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
but i ve id if i get a hold of them already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely they said if i get responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
this is the best phone i have the best seen	1
the color is red why the moon and is so attractive	1
support material is on the cheap side	0
the only downside that there is a camera is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
it is small too light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as going to work i set it up	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
it did also not seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
and looks it works great too	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs have and they all play great	1
creating playlists using the help with this included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
images taken indoor the signs were nt so clear	0
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and trying to find a way suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button would besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
food the price is very good	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and have ever the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
i really have no complaints no control over this unit	0
and it holds sooooo much more than much music and audio files	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that in the price s not what you are buying it for	1
it other books wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
loved it the slim design	1
its worked fine	1
best electronic i ve bought since since i was born	1
nikon i feel price it offers in terms of features is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
by cocking the shutter a lot of to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot shots with very little shutter lag i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
sometimes the system would hang router would crash and the modem so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it the server and found to be extremely slow	0
the price was the lowest i and it was the d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
is the sound quality is really good	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time a few seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minute you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life life	1
bass guitar a fanatics look at the s pii	1

have to say i am i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have reading the been with the ipod as well	0
unfortunately it be found on can t play all of the dvd	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out so to be true in the end my case	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i i line trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
battery life is good although i recommend two using a rechargeable battery to recharge or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to hav rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
i am the best very pleased with it so far	1
this small size speaker system mp pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
they are the same not wowable good	0
i use thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
the screen is very easy to read and the the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too lon stare too long the blue light on the screen is very easy to read and the blue light in th blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you screen is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too lon stare too long	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but am this product really deserves five stars	1
and amazon com has it not buy it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
the camera very versatile camera that is easy is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is manual mode terrific for point and shoot	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a i think a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
it is more portable is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
all nice and compact	1

despite the things fact that this is the most expensive item that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it middle of the day saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1

it has a usb port a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1

the features are really cool like the radio	1
the sound quality it can be a little is excellent except maybe a for the price but tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	0

the canon g gives you a lot tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it average person very easy for the novice to use	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1

i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and very thin it looks it definately would nt not be able to survive a drop	0
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and very loud and had to be returned	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery very easy to use lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1

this this phone is a winner	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router the router i replaced and when combined speed of with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1

but it seems to work so well now that i do seems nt anticipate any problems with it	1

do not have a zen account and if you genre tags do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter hitting the when i meant to scroll	0
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1

one else get it it is woth every penny	1
a bit confusing navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
this is not a great camera for you	0
weaknesses are minor is a bit awkward the zoom settings are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting befor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to the screen is a bit small and the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through ever normal size	0
the screen brightness is really good	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
used to have one and i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone sound is and well recored mp s	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines has a lot of features and ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
ripping mouse the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1

would do it nt buy again because of the customer service	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you it should be able to swap it out	0
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users use firewire and most of them do not even have firewires themselve do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window could so you could see the screen and if the a lot button did nt cover up the ac jack	0

i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors and day out playing the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
but for what i do use it great is perfect	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be the game but there are some things in a regular setting	1
but if great you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
the only downside is the remote very long line which requires a line of sight	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
wow really this speaker really rocks	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which and not too you can take anywhere	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much was supposed to hold of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the phone has a on the camera few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected the phone this phone to do	0

but this camera is great	1
the rate plans are of change also very good at least for me	1
for a while even i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the about the same source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1

the color screen is very easy to use makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
it is small	1
the appearance is okayed	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have the bass and one in the treble and two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit lap or on my was resting on my play desk	0
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
sure it had all the features but when in the air i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
all in all bad device bad for the price and customer service run like hell from this product	0
i am very pleased with it so far	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
in this case addition it comes with a remote control	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for camera a feature loaded high camera performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
for those who want the thump that this a good way is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
wheel the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
all in all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
i bought this slick phone and it for my birthday i am very happy with it	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not on the left side work well	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not the memory is so small that enough	0
the a l o w and it still sounds like the speakers are turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speaker subwoofer is a e good at what they do tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer a l know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less when i installed it than of the dvds i put in it	0
speed usb means fast data transfers	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
price	1
my other big complaint about this monitor movie is the stand	0
it very simple is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
it also views of the city has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
a usb thumb drive the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1

works wow this speaker really rocks	1
i called the tech support and called they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
the software which comes with player is not good at is used to communicate all	0
the grain was terrible	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of short hardware for doing what it was primarily originally meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
you your phone to let people know can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	0
the software is quick easy to use very easy to use and i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
main available dial is not backlit	0
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some the speakers flaw inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt found it very easy to use complicated to learn at all	1
what i do nt like is that lost at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
wer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworke as i have tr i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworke as i have trie constantly busy a hold of them and the one person who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworke as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
it has good color too and price was great	1
the taking pictures g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shot shutter had been released a few seconds	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
my overall experience with this monitor was experience very poor	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1

the netgear router very easy was simple to set up and has few months i have had i worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
the remote is the keyboard flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because have given it a it would give it stars has run well for me during the time i have owned it	0
christmas present and really this is the best phone one could have	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
when i got it home i discovered that the menu a message options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the be compromised most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
i am stunned and amazed at out of the camera the quality of the raw images i am my life getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
enough to make it easy the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
the main problems is too long and the distance for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
works great setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
is ok volume volume level is ok	1
protective case cant be used completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0

this the fm radio is cool	1

it comes will be equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more quality and ease than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud sound is good but the speakers depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear setting the volume to max and playback	1
the person on the other end too of the call can hear you perfectly	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
i m very happy with these i be sure to ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why can t eax would introduce static	0
unlike some of the other people who received a people lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
at the end of the day what end i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from capacity cd player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets thos my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the e mail address i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
they sound really good just as the title would reviews say	1
seemed like a good deal but for this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music and takes cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0

if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0

it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex it comes to trying nothing	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0

unfortunately it can t be play all of the dvd	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is also included mind blowing	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms my opinion are also better	1
