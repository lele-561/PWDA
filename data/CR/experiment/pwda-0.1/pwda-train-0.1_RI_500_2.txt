its fast forward and rewind work a good thing as it seems to much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
finally phone i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
a bit confusing navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks a couple of of use	0
oops easy back to go online and adjust it there	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
store the door would not close	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
the speakerphone the radio tv and all features work perfectly	1
i have stored around cd it is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you not do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple you will be able to make and effective	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
the software my computer mediasource can not work on my pc	0
i have owned for over a year this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1

they could be more comfortable but no complaints in i think they could do better the sound department	1
when the player was working it radio was great but	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does hard to tell because it does it so often	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
to anyone the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players almost at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out and the quality is very good the construction is very pretty flimsy	0
navigating through the menus is super easy going especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
when you turn on your player the music doesnt play when you turn it off it just turns on really fast and the music continues to play turn it on you didnt even notice as you left it when you were turning it of player turns on really fast and the music continues to play turn it off you didnt even notice as you left it when you were turning it off	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
they caused the problem ie duct in the first place and wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
this game sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they features to be added evolve	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
after seeing the music and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly no backlight and there is no way to change this	0
while price of the game im talking the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the i thought price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
also i have not had trouble files reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
it not is worth it	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
world the volume	0
the replacement top of the screen unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt front of the working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you see anything are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
for the price and size and features you can t the quality beat the price	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
player works and looks great if you it can get the dvd is to play	1
with gb of storage i about songs in the player have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
i bought this set it up all and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
second the automatic sync on creative lets content on your phone you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
the other day when came on and i just shut i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
the setup process for the nomad is terrible is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
i was dissapointed that not acer was nt more helpful	0
in addition it comes with a sleek design and powerful headset	1
very simple to use	1
i ve also to reset the had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
this is a nice feature i e it easy to use and if you wake up is early in the morning and app you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital here audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buyin before buying	1
there is an need to set alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
the software on the router is other hand pretty good	1
the changing colors help make it easy to tell with a quick glance	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is say it is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find a pain to use it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the notch reception and sound quality are top notch	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid set up and pcs all connect without issue	1
without any tweaking at all good if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as have i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny odd feel to itthe camera has a little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although notice it when the display really is off in which case you see the speakers are pretty good you own reflection on th not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display really is off in which case you see the speakers are pretty good you own reflection on the screen	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
slow to download and run certain programs all the best wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of as well the kids playing with sparklers	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very doesnt work or just is nd very usefu useful	0
looks fantastic too esp w iphone docked	0
t is which does not of road work along several long stretches on that same route	1
i love being the storage in this thing	1
music organization is based on the id of the file id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with file id missing or incorrect id information	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax you to have a headache can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
this is a nice feature i e it is early in music then this is heavy the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the sound is surprising lots of detail full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to normal to a regular ring	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tell the customer tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
this fun was very prompt standard shipping service	1
the other controls apps are all very easy to use	1
only can vouch for the quality but owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0

i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio line outputs though the latter was not mentioned in this the literature i d scanned before buying	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork out of grad school and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0

i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
this is a directory a good deal for music and data storage	1

price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
good battery life	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major is going problem	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
for the money apex machines most part the have good features	1
canon is optics are better and i believe also their processing algorithms are also better	1

my friends i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1

it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
it surpasses the performance my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a room a small speaker system	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0

the larger zoom is a must it lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
the sound is awesome but if sound quality u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1

huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
the digital zoom takes the manual zoom as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged data and can t keep up with demands	0
very they are not wowable good	0
nothing and frustration but hassle with this company	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and libraries software	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
it more is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load a bit on some computers	0
the person the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
this is an excellent value	1
also the display is hinged and it the side to protect can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
the only complaint i have is that when get to the next page you push in the scroll wheel to select cant just push you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
the color is red and is so attractive	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling it just the guest network things stopped working	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
its far heavier and much larger which might your pocket not seem to matter heavier than a normal phone except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid to power the device and is as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
the scroll wheel is finicky find it hard to get it to work but they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just retur it works most to use it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the devic of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating curve that they just return the device	0
so all things that are yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the computer direct processing from the manufacturer and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way it work if you wanted to	1
the player quality is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1

i ve been proven months now using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1

the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and mouse does not work well	0
colours good contrast clear bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
it did also not seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
i just was fine hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
customer service kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches stretches of road on that same route	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is well worth standout monitor has all this and more	1
there is no way the amount of water battery supplied lasts hours	0
audio is excellent	1
i to reset the ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the world volume	0
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1

the main problem with the nomad and the jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
lufton besides i hate widescreen monitors	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
see the detail in the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one ely customer service rep i think the one rep is probably extremely ove lonely customer service a hold of them and the one person who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworke rep is probably extremely overworked	0
either way can t go wrong way you with this price	1
what a disappointment	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge great to be able plus	1
after nearly pictures i pictures have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the speakerphone the tv and radio all features work perfectly	1
b fast mediasource it takes cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are to navigate to the files embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
great features	1
while my on a laptop laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers difficult making it harder to hear some audio	0

i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am even disapointed	0
all in all this is a good day another excellent creative product	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card similar to s to s as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar and mb fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to s to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me problem at all	1
the be installed software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
it would have been button on the side much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did is a great phone but would nt cover up the ac jack	0
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
issue the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1

b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
much faster than two netbooks and my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along other products with a sub	1
of third the poor design continues with the case	0
i personally like to see would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i of the phone not like because that is where hold my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
this is wonderful what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
if you are then go not picky about image quality go for it	0
the m logo the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great colours good contrast price	1
notch the build quality is top notch	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the near future in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out plastic the construction is pretty flimsy	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
the software for me has nt been a hassle for me at all	1

i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and have allowed gprs will only have been disabled work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable would you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
pc cable it is too expensive for a usb cable	0
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
seriously i love it	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast easy to use but it is also eye candy	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
i spent hours on that and i could spent nt connect to the internet	0
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to put the customer experience stand behind them	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
this small size is very compact and speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
software that the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0

what a day disappointment	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
they could be more comfortable could but no complaints in the sound department	1
while my laptop and netbook have things decent speakers the volume on such es devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately have a metz ct and i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz for me i already a lot of heat owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day day and paying for the return shipping	1

the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
it is a fantastic camera a great value and well worth the price	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because network and not through your own network they have deleted the menu as options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
the sound from the player not audible is ok	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
i was a little that disappointed in the low end	0
it also has a unproven battery life	0
despite the things fact that this is the most expensive item that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it middle of the day saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you on the zen xtra might be better but there is nt really anything the zan xtrail can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with i ve gotten comfortable with it	0

when i took was taking outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
excellent phone the phone looks much i think better than what u see in the pictures	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing sometimes the sound of inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
there are so many functions in powerful this little yet powerful camera	1
it is worth it	1
apparently t mobile is being heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
fact that i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
battery life the drawback this is to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed response times when going to the menu	0
huge storage space i loaded my entire whole collection of music which is nt that much songs that many and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
worth for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
this phone is a winner	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
to my amazement even that process but was error prone	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
to use both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
huge storage space that many i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have for your music gb out of the provided to you	1

files audio is excellent	1
gone the memory is staggering	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life life	1
speakerphone speakerphone	1
this phone apps and features is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
overall the g point of view as well as a sharpness contrast white balance color balance and color response point o delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
what the hell hell is wrong with this thing	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that not for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with the help of one of the amazon customer service reps i will be able to get a hold of the with the help of one of the mos this product it will be taken care of two however if i do i will know that with the help of one of the amazon customer service reps i will be able to get a hold o for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1

i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
i love the not have to worry fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
with the quality price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless terrible and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
nice little phone light compact	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp out there camera out there	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
if you wear it as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
that keeps me only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
charging for paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects lack of kills it for me	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
i did yet not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most not seem to have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally use firewire cards themselve windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
all the latest acer stuff is rest of the top notch	1
no way to contact their customer customer service	0

i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
ripping your songs and selling them online creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
very simple to do use	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a have been using mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there right now costwise	1
the quality of the moveable lcd screen is great	1
overall an excellent phone	1
my other gripe much more expensive is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
featured sharp image	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out all the things turn to be true in my case	1
the good price performance looked just right	1
battery life the drawback in real to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being very difficult to play and plagued afflicted by a number of glitches	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use use	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing i like the design its simple and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
overall i like the system features and performance	1
sure it is a little bigger little bit than the ipod but not by much	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1

beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
lrb lost internet to the internet rrb lost internet access connection with the router internet service internet was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
exasperated at am i called it quits piece of crap and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
it also does also nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
even even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if a moment think i will be using this product in the near future as i do not see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this produc i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1

works out great	1
the replacement unit had a problem i bought too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts change the weather forecast i have found this problem in my area	0
my first impression was text fitch rating positive	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
the menu options appear on the left side of the screen and take up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where most of the menu options are in the menu order to selec one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where most of the screen they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this trying to find a way company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
the storage capacity is great for me	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices breeze easily and further setup was a breeze	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
me no way to contact their customer service	0
the second lasted about a week the third lasted two two weeks before the video went out	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better ever than the ipods	1
range was comparable to even or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
if you re looking for camera then a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
been it has a nice color screen	1
it i have had no problems with the phone	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
i found it very useful for found transferring large files to another computer	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
easy how to pair	1
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is the only thing that has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as season season and seaso such as alias season and season	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
in short if you re just someone that is a cheap and easy way little afraid of technology and need you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
