creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0

the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
