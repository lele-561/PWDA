the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
bottom line i have a price better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on price my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
these speakers are these guys incredibly amazing	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very be a little small readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
to my amazement even that free process was error prone	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality app the negative features were the camera and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands apps free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
issue the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to number contact apex but we never got in touch with them answer our calls we also tried to contact them through the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the highest quality of the nikon optics	1
i have had at all no problem what so ever with this product	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
great product works that works perfectly for my office	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth really and it is really annoying when it does because takes a while before it it does it so often	0
without ever any tweaking at all if the exposure is and the colors accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
even after reading some of the instructions even it is still hard to figure out	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really i think love it	1
even setting the volume to max and leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
it seems very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
solar power goes full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software quality easy to use wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the computer processing of data direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
not only is very well and it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background get to work you can turn up the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative grea music viola get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rr the audio is great lrb well this is relative like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker r great for a computer speaker rrb	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
the camera has a wonderful set of controls features	1
the player is mechanics the problem are also flawed	0
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
its a bit kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms my opinion are also better	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light the controls like aperture priority metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and very easy to use the manual is relatively clear	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and will come back on it works the next day	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player one of is probably the best out there	1
they very well balanced are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
this fun was very prompt standard shipping service	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and quality the photo quality is awesome	1
world the volume	0
now not that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
like other reviewers issues installation was hell	0
think that i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
the features nice i are really cool like the radio	1
a gift of course have to say i have i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
format video output stopped workin	0
has to tell frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
fragile fragile	0
this is the best phone i have seen	1
the in program id tag editing is a strong well point as well	1
small full size	1
if i were to rate think these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people them based want them for	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
it looks very cool and seems quite to be very small to me and very light	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
it also does also nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical chance american phones	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
otherwise this player is is awesome	1
finally ready to drop them and look forward move on with my life i am looking to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward move on with my life i am looking to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
thanks return to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
i got this for christmas and my son it is a great gift	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was order starting to bog it down to the point where i was having le of the bandwidth i was using for my interne to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet data connection	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
i am able to carry it close to my body accessible in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problem problems show up with me too i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedl have repeatedly cried havoc over but people have repeatedl have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissin as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problem problems show up with me too	1
overall it one of the best is the best camera on the market	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
would nt buy again definitely because of the customer service	1
volume level is ok	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and the bass really gets really high	1
however i noticed that when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
this is the third apex product i ve first time i have used this product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the pric bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
it would spin read spin some more and up on the screen then show on the display that there was no disc	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
sound quality quality is good	1
as a non technical person i an hour was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of as well the kids playing with sparklers	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone also has a great screen and user would want	1
i love this player and would probably go over defensive with creative labs again	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs the phone will only work through t mobile is services because network they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used network on a different network	0
i ve had this for months now and i not happy am pleased with my decision	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell company from this product	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money of the price for money a dvd player and enjoy your new dvd player and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money of the price for a dvd players that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of th that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact d popping in a new battery the user can then charge that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in pping in the new the new battery	1
results the picturers are amazing	1
great minds phone	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at want to listen to music on the same level for volume control any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
i am bored with it the silver look	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations going was under minutes	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
however if speed reliability and power to so transmit large amount of data a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
this product is for me good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
the functionality amount of detail on this camera is mind blowing	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
it is enough to so small but big value mac	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it at the end of last year good got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
by this exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
it not is crystal clear	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents store them in to be opened or programs to the system be launched from its disk	0
loud enough for what i need it for i got this for use on my truck going and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
awesome a compact camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the dvd player is is fine	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because have given it a it would give it stars has run well for me during the time i have owned it	0
so slow that it up is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
these speakers have great sound but they will headphones buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many many ways	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the long wait was worth it	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
however it i can not get it to play any of my divx rip does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
i at all have had no problems with the phone	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the i can think of is that speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while phone and it is ringing	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote not show the complete filenames of to the main screen mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back t control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of to the main screen mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
i am using them in my office and they generally work well sound good	1
what a junk	0
finally phone i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
this router is phenomenal	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound really good great and have tons of good bass	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when restored the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
the sound quality very good is very good	1
key instead	0
i wished that they could make music just the volumn a little bit louder	0
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
it had a heavier larger and more sturdy casing	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
what a disappointment	0
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
this is not a great camera for you	0
the sound is surprising full sound with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
i am happy very pleased with its quality and durability	1
transfering is easy the software is easy and makes everythig pretty easy	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as these images when i view them on my monitor	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
color screen is good	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
bright visible screen	1
nothing nothing but hassle with this company	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
they caused the problem ie duct in the first place and wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
p it would not recommend is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
it does well in all aspects the world of internet browsing	1
its far heavier and have to carry it around a bit of a pain to carry much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
it worked worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
both units are small very small with similarly small speakers	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up with the mouse down or tilt feature rrb	0
i can my friends recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery great battery life great storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
the screen is very easy to read and the the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too lon stare too long the blue light on the screen is very easy to read and the blue light in th blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you screen is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too lon stare too long	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well quite as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the don t work stock ones suck	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
agree i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt find it connect to the internet	0
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
get used to it i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
the prints are available beautiful	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
i did nt get get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
to the player connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to to the player your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
nice to be very machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with agree others here about the quality of this speaker	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player device in my opinion and does nt support a folder stucture	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the interface software itself which not only slow should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
i had was broken and i had be serviced was on its way i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
i highly recommend a nokia	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
the first routers worked good its for years	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
we got rex two phones for the t mobile family plan and one one of them came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on that i have to spend money something i paid over dollars for	0
the only minor nits a bit hard to get a good balance i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck to be carried with a strap strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
been trying anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month i ve gotten of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why with the quality i picked the nomad	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now on playing interface you a lot of things can see the interface as modern or classical	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend need to be a starter rrb and user friendly	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
all fell apart i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
after seeing the music and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
user replaceable user battery	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
this is one of the nicest electronic and most useful devices that i ve ever owned	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
update jan the device apple says the device has worked flawlessly for the past yea has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
if a good deal you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
her response delivery was prompt	1
the station fm radio is cool	1
this is wonderful to have for your family your first dvd player	1
i highly recommend it a nokia	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
down it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
i give it a rating of stars for give looks	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
excellent battery life hours beats what ipod is	1
the scene mode works well for the kind remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
will be bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
i tried called apex cust the service no help	0
the device itself is is pretty solid	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
the app software is easy to use	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the the lack of rumors relieved to know i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
recently bought this a very good quality of images and a very high quality of colors m pixel fine combos an coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent camera from coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar t with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent camer a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle wide viewing angles and best of all great price	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because of the user different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the mind zx	1
quality is very good it the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and have ever the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
setup software for my application i found the software setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the very short control station is too short	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with yet digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
is not very deep and the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
good battery life	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
when the player was working it was great not a problem but	0
all i can say is that can say this is an excellent devise	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
the world that this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
maybe it find the quality of my is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough eq for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
in this case addition it comes with a remote control	1
excellent available range of metering options as well	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine apart from speaker for the amount i paid	1
sound is crystal clear very good and the bass is very deep as well	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
first i ll start off by saying that this game players hardware is pretty good	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is also included mind blowing	1
i exceeded all of have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
p s i dont know why but it the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should make you rethink be	1
i also did nt like the on the screen way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
they will not respond busy to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
here is the brief synopsis the full phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
price gb of storage	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
i did nt read not have to a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
takes excellent photos	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
they are not wowable good	0
i how good he have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	1
player has a problem the following season by with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
do very simple to use	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company seems to be the case is products	0
the price performance looked just right	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
been replaced by the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is have link to a compatible	0
love it i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
my first impression was positive	1
unit suddenly it worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
longer battery life greater accessibility social media and music services and pc compatibility are the main goals to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
second the automatic sync on creative lets content on your phone you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and of dealing with horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
speakerphone	1
went the first night i got this phone i put it next to me see if it would wake me up and it did i listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weigh when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
this is an excellent value	1
decided to contact since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the only two minor issues size of the lens i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know for what they were of for the price they were at rrb	1
set easy to hook up	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and latest version of the found that a vast improvement	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and have i m even more pleased with it	1
t is which does not of road work along several long stretches on that same route	1
they sound they really good just as the reviews say	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that photographers more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera beginners to grow into	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
the size is small	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
you your phone to let people know can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
gone the memory is staggering	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
the system this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mps mbps	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
harmon international has done a great job has a great sound and a on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
fm receiver it has been renamed none	0
battery life the drawback in real to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
x the zoom is nice	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any may arise blanks that remain	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to make it easy for miss precious shots	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
the color screen makes this free phone stand out even after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
bright visible view this screen	1
it in size is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play it s not all some of your real dvds	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great think i love this phone	1
even use to listen better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
also for is a bit some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
i m sure it would still would be able to hear it if you set and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
i book from amazon just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit very easy to set up is located on the top floor rrb and way it is set up very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from even any picture on your computer and if you can make games you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
no sound effects fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
you people can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me problem at all	1
ooh and i it broke but dropped it and didnt break it it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
second gripe in the the monitor is that some or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a may flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they dont sound too bad sound i like the sound but a little weak	0
the screen is large and easily read	1
ring tones one ring and only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
and man i had laugh when i was trying to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs figure out how as the title	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of accurate the size of the dial and that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on in the browser this player	0
this product is cocaine too fragile for normal use	0
the too small storage capacity is great for me	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
the is good but interface used could be better designed	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there camera is no better camera out there period	1
when it works different its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
it means also has unproven battery life	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it to go back would nt do it	0

changes but canon never fails to amaze	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone saving features and point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run that i can t use at worst a very expensive one on which i can s create folders or at worst an expensive lesson i be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from worst again	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or working not even be read at all	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the are going to cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
great color display sharp picture and just the right size a good size for my desk	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy easy as i would have liked	0
having editing software spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0

despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i have i have to must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped a little surprised the box	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
lots of flaws of noise but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
i find find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is a few feet no more than about feet away	1
the other day when came on and i just shut i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
i my instincts should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0

made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic cameras and jvc players	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1

the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
it worked from to first but then at which time the picture failed completely	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when works you are bored	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is manual mode terrific for point and shoot	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
so far the router has worked well	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0

for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of some people the time but some people there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say some people they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak get a the levels	0
also it was only with a good deal free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
there is no speaker grill to offer provide any protection to the driver	0
the like more i work with it the more i love it	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they am not a fan of the auto focus modes are dummy proof where and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
main dial is the not backlit	0
the son is so excited he sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1

it has lots a lot of little cute features my favorite being the games and the music and the radi of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1

the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny odd feel to itthe camera has a little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0

navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you on the zen xtra might be better but there is nt really anything the zan xtrail can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with i ve gotten comfortable with it	0

took to play me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
the controls are on the buttons the side instead of on the front the top which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
good range speed and speed	1
as a portable player it comfortable should feel a bit more durable	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0

focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
it will read the songs on the and play all cd audio disc	1
too bad the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky bit in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
the display is large enough the screen and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button would besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
unfortunately i i bought a ps and bought a player because the ps could nt play play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
it is easy enough are currently to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1

second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
for those who want this is not the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	0
great colors pictures and white balance	1

i just set it up manually which is on my computer very easy	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
what got be a great dvd and i got my fill of file me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud in that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was at work and it was loud already out on the street	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
one last note i purchased price this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
overall i like the unit	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and on my macbook pro and it works flawlessl it works flawlessly	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0

both anyone to use even if are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
what is added in functionality terms of durability detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
simply alone this product was created and was left behind	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us it possible for me to experience photography on a totally new level	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
i have used this monitor for a few months for over a year and have had no problems	1
my only gripe about the battery life hardware is the buttons	0

i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have from the manufacturer been very satisfied with it so far	1
this is a very light phone weighing less a little less than oz with long battery life	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you is so easy to use forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the quality is superb	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
nikon i feel price it offers in terms of features is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
mediasource machine did not install on my personal notebook	0
after i the device reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc the only thing i can say is online support was n had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0

a great system work at an incredible price	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
however shareport on this new router worked of is disabled most the time	0
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
no option for caller id pictures custom ringtones with or individualized ringtones	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could should nt be any easier	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a great good sound in a small package	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy in my home with it	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
also another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
for the price and size and features you can t the quality beat the price	1
either way can wrong t go wrong with this price	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the appearance dr paul is okayed	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
the pictures are razor sharp sharp even in macro	1

if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital great deal on a camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean is the case hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and sound the picture was awesome	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved it a bit upon it with new technology	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
the canon computer download all of software used to download sort upload and manage of the files your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
great camera great investment	1
solid resistant and dents to scratches better heat dissipation	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being of problems afflicted by a number of glitches	0
great phone i but d buy another	1
thing anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does is a nice touch but not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
speakerphone features loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
and easy transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax you to have a headache can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
both the versions are available and black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
system the light auto correction is awesome	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
within about once a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy ever with it ever since	1
my blu ray ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well wd forever thereafter	1
for the money apex machines most part the have good features	1
i find all of found the controls to be intuitive the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
the system was it nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
listen to your for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
well it power had good power but no precision at all	1
all and all i am extremely happy pleased with this camera	1
had a jvc system that this one was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it quality is pretty good to the ipod	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
i like the nomad the way it is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
other tagging problems result the from the nomad is operating system	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
also it was very easy i found that it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old net router thanks for the help to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
as well one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
there are lots of interesting features included such in the app as eax and customization	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the able settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
i ve been bothered by blown the fact that i cant make out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and shutter had been pressed and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter the camera had been released a few seconds	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
pictures and videos the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
the on this trip service from the supplier was exceptional	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely fact that into any pocket without falling out	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time up the sound quality is good to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
dont like i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very have happy	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was play a big can plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident jpeg artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vc that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone address book to this phone great feature to have saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on not possible all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than capable any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
very simple to use	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any reviews problems this phone but i think it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the bo right out of the box	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
it has good color too and price was great	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house either that one didn t work either	0
great price	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and designed for beginners and is produces spectacular images	1
also very light and portable	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage feature to have over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged data and can t keep up with demands	0
range was comparable to even or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i have had mine for a month couple of weeks now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i display ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
it not is worth it	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
the larger screen has allowed be used to put them me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	0
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
after using it for just a month i could game not play any dvd	0
overall and reliable the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the went out color signal disappeared	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to overall anyone wanting a high good quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the usb port on the back of the phone is a nice feature	1
this sound quality and base is amazing	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
you a button can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene button that can be used to adjust the focus that would be really helpful if shooting a scene tha with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tomatically focus with the push of a button and it ha tough to automatically focus	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that need s not what you are buying it for	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and in your pocket not bother you	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the s in the g is a real powerhouse	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
the g looks like like a work of art	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
picturesgreat great quality picture and features	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am bored disapointed	0
for the price there rest of us is nothing better	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
the screen very bright is large and easily read	1
no i dont like it but games it has a cool screen why not use it	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be downloading extremely slow	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and a little bit of everything this product delivers both	1
however like the fact that i have i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem some way in the first place	0
the interface work was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing for the phone and a standard mm headset jack	0
so far i use it have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants i would recommend it to someone to pay next to nothing	0
i m delighted with this product	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
for my birthday i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
good good looks	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
navigation to the cloud is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
get home it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
the front cover can pop off easily but back pocket i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
while my on a laptop laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers difficult making it harder to hear some audio	0
and it holds sooooo much has music and audio files	1
i just received my gb zen xtra xtra and i m extremely pleased with i yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if because of something that i did or if they do that i dont know if its because it was something tha they do that i dont know if it was something that i did or if it is a malfunction of the system of the route it was a malfunction of the system of the router	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
i found the songs and add them using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
only can vouch for the quality but owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
unfortunately after a message saying im loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
i would highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image settings in the camera the default setting for the canon camera does not show you araw image the canon softwar with a the default setting for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image settings in the camer raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
received apex dvd and the picture dvd player was great when set up with s connector	1
great are speakers overall	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i low frequencies and suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has playing mp s and it has difficulty trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and best of the this item seemed to be the only one i could find best in that category	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone the fact that i can add it option great priced and texting calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
i am quite happy with it the camera	1
i fact that im love the storage in this thing	1
the sound the car from the player is ok	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
good looks	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby it runs	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
the customer support is very rude	0
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of other eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or example can be used to on a train	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
the mms integrated technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
the speakerphone the tv and radio all features work perfectly	1
screen brightness is really good	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this trying to find a way company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
the only thing that it really i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no web use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
i m delighted with this not happy product	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
these monitors are great the best deals for the price	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv hdtv is a great way to watch lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtc and its delivering grea and its delivering great	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as been working well	1
software is another that i have had in the past great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt any of my other software work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged so they were destroyed even in any way	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
first the zen how lets you sync to more than one computer	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
without a doubt best the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
i ve very effective been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small the keyboard and difficult to press	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there camera on the market today at this price point	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup recommend that you follow wizard which will work with your os if you will see that you choose to use it	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
quite working simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
after months has started it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m kind of product thrilled with my purchase	1
when i put it to the back of the house the speaker wire worked as expected even out of door use for my daughter is speakers on the speaker wires the wire worke graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
door broke after a month	0
the sound for keeping is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
great phone i d buy another	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the fingerprint scanner speakerphone	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
the menus are easy to the user interface and settings are easy us navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch top of the battery near the bottom latch	0
quality camera the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
it seems that seems to me with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
i quite impressed ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
fragile	0
the first one we installed did nt work and say our kids were devastated to say the least	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor would manual	0
it works flawlessly only during installation of the system during installation of cx	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and both of those things and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i have stored around cd it is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
know how to program in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
the rate plans are rest of the also very good at least for me	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router the router i replaced and when combined speed of with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
for a specific location i the most part still think its a great phone	1
this really great is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
so if you re game for a little fiddling you looking may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
it is the most bang for the buck out your buck there	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
but i ve already commons and my emailed creative tech support response that about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
creative mediasource software is from scratch ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i was using used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i love this monitor	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which supply caused to occasionally not turn on	0
user replaceable battery	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze that it would during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
it is more than days and it does not show not working the picture no matter what i do	0
no one sells a mm x mm is sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge great to be able plus	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
the sound quality is really good	1
it allows the usb interface to connect to a web on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
no propietary headset jack	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
oops i forgot easy to go online and adjust it there	0
i am the best very pleased with it so far	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it my battery life every or days or so	1
it not is small	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
the picturers are amazing	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
all the latest acer sports stuff is top notch	1
what really made this a the sound quality mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
they are the same not wowable good	0
this system is very powerful	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones to other speakers or or external receivers	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
bottom work line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
i simply think youll love this feature	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
works great	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention mention that they were polyphonic	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but christmas i was looking for a mp player for the zen xtra i researched many different mp players but prouder of it and i m convinced it i finally decided on this one and now that i have it prouder of it and i m convinced it i finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
want to do i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the use as you have to go selection you want	0
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
the player has firmware which will remove memory leaks the glitches if there are any	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the very easy quality is very good	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound quality ideal for use produced by the nomad	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
i am not to savy with how to use it a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
it is i was wrong smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have comfortable and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen i also got rid of a few things i had to do with my clunky ol lr to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen i also got rid of a few things i had to do with my clunky ol lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
with this mp player you get much more memory mp for much less than an ipod	1
upon opening these i found them to be them in my hand i felt closer really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to is very good your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
last night i i thought needed to reset the router	0
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
my wife is even more than me pleased due to its widescreen	1
so now it still plays everything in the background you just can t see it	0
they do look cool in the video the dark though	0
deficiencies with zennx troubles are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries it s a little slow and it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it it s not a bad deal just make sure it s charge that came with weren t charged properly if you have any problems it	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image considered to be quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response in terms of image quality point of view	1
the interface of however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
the quality the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
used to have one and i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am just recently extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
neither message received was answered	0
the customer support is very mr trump rude	0
i m very happy with these be sure to i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
the screen is bright and ring the color tones are unlimited	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using overall this is a good device however it the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	1
it looks great and has a touchscreen is loaded with features	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
very good value value for the money	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
the speakers sound quality are nice sound quality no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo g machine nt answer my emails always and their telephone line is always the phone and their on line support site is down almost always their email is always and thei busy	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal i thought for the money	1
got a system error problem it days after purchase	0
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
even works better on g f band than the linksys	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want a little bit of style a something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files fact that there is an stored on cd rs dvds	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time a lot for something to work	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although notice it when the display really is off in which case you see the speakers are pretty good you own reflection on th not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display really is off in which case you see the speakers are pretty good you own reflection on the screen	1
the good price performance looked just right	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
say they look fantastic	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates that of the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nis is green backlight di the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable the quality given its features and specifications	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good not the best in the world sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
sharp image	1
it has a nice color screen	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
is amazing this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
check out to google com great price for all the features	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority in manual mode with and manual modes	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
great phone	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth will get being lost	0
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
setup was very easy	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills coffee on the floor my beer but does nt wash my car	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little very good blurry	1
because this camera sucks is beautiful	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment the quality after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand please for an ipod	1
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
i would nt mind having an external do adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed option to on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
this little speaker has the best dynamite sound	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we go back and had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the turn it on we had to use router because the gui one would nt work	0
office starter web cam is also fairly bookthis net book good light in cheap as it is weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i like it the automatic key lock function	1
a list this is extemely lame	0
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
my friends of the food were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
then in short if cheap and easy way you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace then this is great fo all day this router is great for you	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the switch negotiated the speed was set to just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
i wish there my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
the resolution great is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
i ve attempted get to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get signal a video signal from the machine	0
price price	1
not a good idea as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if gear in the case you load up all your songs beforehand	0
even when you even though it is not when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer was authorize disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your isnt even when yo computer is authorized	0
hooked it worked like a charm charm it was a great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
is this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
volume level is ok	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
it is versatile and seems very versatile to be one of the best	1
also the case carrying doesnt open case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
of the size is small	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
while is still rated four out of there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better ever than the ipods	1
the appearance is okayed	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what limit i can do with it	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
the movie clips taken will always have a little bit of you some noise in it you can t avoid that	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with easy well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
the remote is a little little hard to understand	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has features a myriad of features	1
it has never worked	0
i was at all worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
i find it too bright	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e i s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
people also have complained about the case not having a the case window but that is not lot of protection really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even not the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
for the price and features me it is really good	1
is my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
when the i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had the first one to be returned	0
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
the sound quality it can be a little is excellent except maybe a for the price but tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	0

the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can a very easy to use ap instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly need to worry about that the ability to delete pics or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
the internal network still of the modem functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0

lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0

one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0

for a while even i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
it has fm radio option a free music streaming and i can listen to music anytime	1

excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully service and through the jukebox	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
i love like this player	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like one on a cd	0
the image quality is sound excellent	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
at ounces it is as light pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
the controls are much a bit inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
going to miss i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
this player everything else seems to work fine with everything else	1
the replacement was even worse the old one than the original one which was now working fine	1
the picture screen is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1

while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility if i had the chance based of it	1
third the poor design continues the following with the case	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
creative labs customer support website http www creativelabs com is useless	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0

the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1

of these i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my be able to do the same i cant tell car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
i ve had this thing just over a month have and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
for instance i made several back ups of my player i just press f dvd old movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
to opinion it is keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive could no dvd r that the disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned tha medi no problem playing the more expensive could no dvd r that the disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned tha media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the had made myself that i coul dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1

works out great	1
with the smooth knob turning it or not i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
it also has a stock tracking which you can invest app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker good choice for an set	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0

this small size speaker system mp pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that volume of my own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better soun should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1

all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and deal wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
very big intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but left just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just stay to get half this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
music organization is based on the id of the file id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with file id missing or incorrect id information	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector to be a bit might be a problem	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1

the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoof know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speaker o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but o w s o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the sound turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speaker it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view a few but as the most beneficial	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly whole thing idiot proof	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get do a few different a few variations with it	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1

only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
i enthusiastically recommend this book camera	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
this system is is very powerful	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
my first impression was positive	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices breeze easily and further setup was a breeze	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
when i turned the phone on how small the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1

the memory is staggering	1
i really love this netbook	1

pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
the battery life this is amazing	1

the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
the phone is sound quality is complaints great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the sound quality great the screen is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a and videos ton of songs on this thing	1
but about you ever noticed that of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture i play will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast fast and the music fast continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1

so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
hand all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides r the player to work the buttons of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
fixed speaker cable so why do this	0
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
after rest of the world about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
this has happened with several things in the past and i dont know what it different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it work again and again did not work one time before	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like feels like the plastic it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
these speakers are great	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1

this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt not purchase it	0

all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
it to be placed the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1

the scroll wheel wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1

the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
no way to contact their customer complain about service	0

the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the some people wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
they fired away and the picture turned quite out quite nicely	1

after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
the software sound quality on the router is pretty good	1
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1

because other people that complain about this player are talking is not a bad player bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast that you like and easy	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support support line was very helpfulthe technical support line on the other hand was very hel line on the other hand was very helpful	1
