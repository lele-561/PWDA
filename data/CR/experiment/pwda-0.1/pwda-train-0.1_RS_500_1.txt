the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
my first impression was positive	1
so yes ugly with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and as	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
any the g delivers what must be considered a best image quality of overall current megapixel digicams from the detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
this camera than closest to perfect is any other digicam that is megapixel	1
good range speed	1
solid resistant scratches to better heat dissipation	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software having starting to bog the down to it point where i was far too often to reset it and my computer was in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0

i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what telephone was primarily meant to do to be a wireless it	1
with sprint of all my calls were loud and clear unlike first	1
very good value for the money	1
speakerphone	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and back be sending this awful deceptive product will	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
i guess that a lifetime warranty means it may take limited lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
the infrared is re blessing hours you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me if of a entering my numbers	1

cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and some rubber put on the corners	0
the picturers are amazing	1
traveler am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business i	0
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good up wake software sleep timers multiple play modes	1
maybe it is i lack of experience but my found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
overall apple sounds great and less expensive than small is overpriced ipod	1
picture in quality outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
its far heavier and much larger which might in seem to it except if you use it while running or keep matter not your pocket	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit well very	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
any quick sync is nt nt good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is the very useful	0
grill is no speaker there to offer any protection to the driver	0
huge storage space even at kbs a ton can store you of songs on this thing	1
having usb makes very for fast transfers	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images quite impressive are	1

the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
be adjusted for personal preference settings can sound	1
fixed why cable speaker do this	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best one albeit a gb portable hard drive on which i can t create folders or worst at a very expensive lesson to companies never in buy products from again	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
this camera has canon is what plus what you see in the lcd is great colorimetry you get	1
ok is battery life	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
unit for weeks great worked then video output failed	0
technical support and rude unhelpful	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
best in class sound	1
to easy hook up	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
depressing the not button is scroll always responsive	1

this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
i m with these happy very i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
if you re quality for a looking tower speaker this is it	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
at recommend this monitor hard to beat highly this price point	0
for the price dvd is a very nice it player	1
very simple to use	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under thrilled m i with my purchase	0
did not work enough but it easy	1

mine dead pixels on no	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
overall the nikon is camera very dependable robust and useful little a	1
fine worked	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
i do like this phone overall am returning it unforutnately i but	1
i think apex best the is dvd player you can get for the price	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
also mp have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr i cds	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
to easy very set up	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and more indoor shots are about good provided that your subject is no the than very feet away	1
i like not is color better but it is the nomad terribly flashy	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
great picture	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
about of the time it can t find when the device i attach it to my pc	0
too difficult to change genre album track for large number of tracks information	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to little a this conservative but be product really deserves five stars	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
my house is small to it is hard so judge the real strenght of perfectly through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked the product in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible great the quality of the features is and	1
but is finicky it works most of the device the scroll wheel there is some learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate a find it so frustrating that they just return the time	0
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
the make instantly can be a bit challenging but when you can pics delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting and inside this camera very simple adjustments effective	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
all in all is another excellent creative product this	1
you in see the lens barrel can the view finder	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
is highly recommended otherwise this phone	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
after several years of torture in the hands of when customer to i am look and delighted to drop them forward service august at t i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
with eax on you you modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good can can get different variations with it	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed wireless and dropped to mbps down to mbps	0
this is basicly junk play dvd	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i gave to only stars due it the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
valet plus up and was set is easy to configure in about minutes	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
this was an awesome player no the video output before longer worked	0
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb the amazon instant videos could watch i on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0

first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
the technical support phone my was responsible for line giving technical support stars	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
buttons tho seem a little sticky do and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1

the replacement was even worse than now which was the original one working fine	1
the screen daylight bright easy to see in the is with nice colors	1

thanks to amazon is amazing my policy i was able to return the product at no loss on return part	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1

the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to use and buy a sophisticated flash unit	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
we the well pleased with are monitor and the company	1
the data rate over the network storage much but i only so it for occasional backups use it does nt bother me too is rather slow	0

while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
on i have is the clicker the only problem the mouse pad is stiff	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1

it works during flawlessly installation of cx	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box tech service the failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
first i ll start off by saying is this players hardware that pretty good	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail and options all of the above mp cameras easy to understand that use a lot of features and with on challenges comes add great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
even the slightest distorts your image totally of the shakes	0
i did buy the notmad software a week vast and found that a ago improvement	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
it has a play inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically few one after another like on a cd	0
the size is than bigger a little bit the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
look fantastic they	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
it is easy to use beginners for but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is camera excellent an to grow into	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
sometimes the system would then so i would have to restart the router hang get going again	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
casing had a heavier and more sturdy it	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
the slim design loved	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and can t play everything the player now	0
the only thing i do this like about nt is the cover does suck	0
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
the color is red so attractive is and	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once there online the router is login at is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
months of use no longer it and recognizes anything	0

the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0

found i after hooking the thing up that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
dell ultrasharp can see a drastic difference between this monitor and i in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1

the grain was terrible	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0

it looks great and is loaded with features	1
you is useful at times especially when you listen to a of genres variety as it will adjust the equalizer for the included eax support which can be a big hassle	1
they look fantastic	1

even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
with it enabled anytime we made because we had to manually press the turn on radio on button the front of the router changes to the router the gui one would nt work	0

to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1

the zennx will of running for the price keep a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
the second fine is working just set	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to progam and auto yet its be creative exposure settings bother excellent photos if you do nt want to provide with the settings	0

for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts an in intimate setting	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
about will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here i the quality of this speaker	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1

it has a x optical zoom average for these cameras is which	0
the speaker wire is the only drawback is very thin	0
monitor could tell this was a cheap i as soon as i set it up	0

slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
for ask for more of this product i could not the cost	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
overall to would reccomend these i someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
the service the supplier from was exceptional	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1

while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
