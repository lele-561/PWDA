i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
but anyway the only thing you should have voice dialing look at here is the fact that the phone does really	1
this has so many capabilities that have ll always you room for new technologies as they evolve	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking linked is effective in organizing your collection and is as windows mediaplayer to a good cddb service	1
irreversible ca nt that upgrade is you	0
also it has unproven battery life	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically i christmas i researched out there but finally decided many different mp players this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and for m convinced it is the best one on	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
working is not good either and the driver has trouble the software with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
creative mediasource software catalog ok to rip is burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch rip to my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
we the frames the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter tried started to freeze for no reason	0
look they fantastic	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
light compact nice little phone	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad of the times when there are quieter talkers on the other end too quiet at line	1
the router failed i lrb completely dead rrb when today need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
it came packaged well	1
chic look and with build the player comes in a compact form good a metal face plate	1
this item was the most inexpensive at monitor available to me inch the time i made the purchase	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
sound exceptional it i can t really compare though to the ipod	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal missing of information	0
its ability to serve as a back up is for my music collection a huge plus	1
your products though kudos apple are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
unfortunately it can all play t of the dvd	0
was good easy to read screen	1
the auto setting does a job great most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the toggle button work is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not that well	0
on the back the usb port is a nice feature	1
and the body construction quite a bit general has in of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the screen to fill of the letterbox and the image still looked normal	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you a previous model nokia phone owned have	1
not only smooth it functional and runs super is fast but it is also eye candy	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly make you do or like that are not focused perfectly nt need lighting adjustments delete pics this camera very simple and effective	0
it worked from to at which time the picture completely failed	0
your hand still fits in the palm of it and it is not heavy	1
the me its perfect and for quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1

is insanely fast usb transfer	0
i little the size and weight of this like critter	0

quite simply the and firmware or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
canon g is does it consistently	0
amazon was wonderful paying picking it up the next day and about for the return shipping	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you it calling answers the phone not while are is ringing	0
recent price drops have made the g best the bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
the g to needs different type of battery charging system also the smaller canon cameras the battery a has be charged while in the camera but the charging system from enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
tell d to you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough i try this	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
is very good the price	1
here only the anyway thing you should really look at but is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
good bass have a very rich sound and the speakers also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
no dead pixels mine on	1
i also liked the you that fact can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all and to work apex dvd players claiming none worked	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the this of quality speaker	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally your image distorts	0
is quite powerful the hands free speakerphone	1
it carry light enough to is around all day without bother	1
the monitor works very a with well sharp and bright display	1

in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
and steel in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless the body construction heft of the s	0
