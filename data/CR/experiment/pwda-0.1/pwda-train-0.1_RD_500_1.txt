excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1

the grain was terrible	0
the camera is in a trip this past week i asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really to rate it based on players in a different class	1
comparing data storage with price	0
some features in the user interface	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located the top floor rrb and very user friendly the setup and security aspects	1
the main problems for me is that dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a so could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
however for a budget i think an excellent choice	1
we got two phones the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken died after less two weeks of use	0
the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
in any case navigation by artist is ok however i miss an to navigate by folders	0
even the is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it work when it did not work one time before	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the picturers are amazing	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
and it works great too	1
i have it a week now and has exceeded my expectations	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the color screen is as are the polyphonic ringtones	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
the sound surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can go wrong	0
granted i have only used this player for setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
overall i like it	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
so far i have and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad	0
am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0

the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
i m not one uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
the price is very good	1
i found using mediasource to to the nomad jukebox be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
the player plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not a dvd stopping a particular point a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong come quick	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
i just purchased this player and have say that i it	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
megapixels is for anybody and the photo quality	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
however speed reliability power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera are very intuitive	1
simple click buttons and display are very easy to read access and use	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0

this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
because other people that complain about this are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast is horrible	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
find all well placed and not flimsy the least	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
the usb port is a nice feature	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1

i am absolutely in awe camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1

the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1

the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
the auto setting does most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1

halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is	0

the function lever the one which between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job it up	1
it is unlike my canon slr so easily fits in my pocket	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0

picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1

both are easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
propietary headset jack	0
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0

works super easy	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
considering the price and this be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
i to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1

this little camera has created a marriage and nikon knew i could love a digital camera so	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0

these monitors are great for the price	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
when the player was working it was great but	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1

that is a rare and valuable feature	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0

the interface used could be better designed	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only	1

all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0

the grain was terrible	0
i have even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1

months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
even when it will upon reboot keep saying your computer new even when it is nt and force it that your computer is authorized	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you how to program jme you can even make own apps games	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
bright visible screen	1
this is extemely lame	0

it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
over for the this is a unit	0

first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
the problems came from my video card	0
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
without a doubt the apex dvd player that ve seen	1
i the support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
unlike some of the other people who a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
chose this one because from what i read it was the deal the	1
but it work so well now that i do nt anticipate problems with it	1
the second set is working just fine	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the woofer is much larger	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself be that it is advertised	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1

finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews said it was slow	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction something paid over dollars for	0
this player is an ideal purchase	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made experience photography on a totally new level	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
and have had no problems	1
these speakers are great	1
nice little phone light compact	1
it is clear	1
capacity	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about photography	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
honestly this player	1
a my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
is great piece speaker system for a computer worth every penny	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the device itself	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was in a reasonable amount of and guided me through the process without a problem	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature find out more just log on to	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
this means that a good chance that this phone will not break easily typical american phones	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was size it fits nicely into any pocket falling	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is what i can do with it	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have rented	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
anything this phone does does perfectly	1
i do nt for see myself having in the coming year or two however if do i know that with this product it will be taken care for free and quick with and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
is the most bang for the buck out there	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into rest of my furniture	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
protective case completely useless is since it	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
looks ok chrome and mirrors	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was	1
great features	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
first of all the is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
volume level is ok	1
was comparable to or possibly than the old linksys router i had been using for years	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
bright visible screen	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use works great for me many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results idiot program auto mode	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
main dial is not backlit	0
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
very easy to set up	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up	0
ve had this thing for than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are with things that you expected this phone to do	0
within year there problems with my menu dial knob	0
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
for the price it a very nice dvd player	1
is the finest camera in its and category i have ever used	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
for instance i made several back ups my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays dvds	1
my ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after and perform well forever thereafter	1
great	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
the monitor works with a sharp and bright display	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better its resolution limits	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
in other words is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
broke after a month	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
and it works great too	1
this by far the nicest one so many ways	1
the sound that from that little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
however it does not play windows media and i not get it any of my divx rips	0
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of methods and can get a video signal from the machine	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
the sound quality	1
no matter the format	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to behind them	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
i easily enlarging pictures to with visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend one now	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the rrb	0
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
it is easy enough to use for beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
negotiated the speed just fine and the router with a gige link	1
software the software is crap	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia	1
volume level is ok	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
what i do nt like is that at music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
the colors and everything are great	1
honestly i love this player	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
