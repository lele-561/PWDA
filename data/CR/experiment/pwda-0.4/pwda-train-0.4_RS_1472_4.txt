complete are minor of mp s feel and does layout the back so it you nt show are only size filenames the so weaknesses must cycle through every zoom setting of the remote control normal with really long names to getting before	0
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
the main problem jukebox the with zen nomad xtra gb is the software	0

the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
voice no recording fm been these would have or nice extras	0
the backlight goes off way too quickly the phone on and there is no way to change this	0
simply the canon g this price point there the best digital camera today out at is	1

a i very is with pleased so here my zx m quick review	1
call of the other end the person the on can hear you perfectly	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
the numerous other programs has obviously and with static ip addresses firewalls router problems	0
cable pc is expensive too for a usb cable	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
software about half the time sucks hangs up my notebook i but definitely do nt mind buying notmad	0
this player in replace advantage has the is the fact by the user can herself the battery him that biggest opening the lid the new battery popping possibly and	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
it has little of my cute the games and the pim lots radio and features being the favorite	0
now i i own it can t however that imagine being without it	1
battery well is that autofocus does one downside work not when though is low	1
i cons think the satellites look ugly	0
but necessary ve already tech creative emailed they about me i gotten timely responses support will fix it it for if and	1
network accessible in a can drive so you a plug has usb usb powered port and have it storage	1

i sent my monitor in but gd repairs from such a hz to acer very for small random buzzing problematic for my monitor of problem acer	0
they look fantastic	1
it easy is enough to it to grow into a beginner has but like me for plenty of features for me use	1
is staggering memory the	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
a on day time a display rack in were brightly produced by this camera a shade during about feet away pictures lit in blurry and focusing room of orange	0
i strongly would recommend this product	1
the in size coolpix is to wonderful easy nikon high quality and compact use	1
wireless up dropped to the d link down connected speed extreme to mbps and hooked n to mbps	0
the has get you all has for features the i pod zen xtra only if creative labs if from amazon the and going to pay your this great player	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
manuver found the through the menus very to and learned how i controls intuitive quickly	1
with my universal remote control work not will this apex model	0
the unit works great taking my cassette for my car your is also easily adapter off worked the road eyes without with	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
could in more comfortable be but department they the sound no complaints	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
less line i i a better set of speakers in to bottom than speakers for my lrb at least computer have my ears rrb the creative labs on trigue half the cost	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
have in itself this unit no questions i problems in the future and the for the year replacement asked it warranty know be is will since worth will only will creative for it warrant which days totally ridiculous	0
price	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
talking voice the when is not very clear	0
this many is so in the nicest one by far ways	1
and best was nowhere near stable the was code in alpha stage at the system	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
and controls have gotten use to them somewhat harder to use than are not i the ipod the justify did but think the huge difference even at the beginning would in price	0
the data rate over is for storage the so but i network nt rather slow only occasional backups use it does it bother me too much	0
i also are in zoom mode you like the way nt displayed information when did it way down into the screen	0
can folders not the audio files created for be	0
not the cost of this product for could i ask for more	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
seems the headphone jack to be a major problem	0
it is the out there most for the buck bang	1
not at and would bought this set it up connect i wireless n speeds	0
the ipod is small overall bigger than used keep not necessarily inferior in mind but this is because different expensive that but less in is it technology the zx	1
had a jvc system that was sound and old i is amazing but the onkyo thought it was good years	1
due even more pleased wife is my to its widescreen	1
a little bit bigger size and weighs the the ipod is it than a little bit more	0
the ever which by i easily the progressive scan option a button on the remote control turned can one of be simplest and easiest remote controls off have seen or used is	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
any tweaking by at a if produced exposure is accurate the colors as are realistic as i and ever seen image film without this ve raw all is the	1
like it a nx the categorizes revised relatively intuitive this player boasts a decent size and weight and on navigational that system quickly based is id tags predecessor excellent sound	1
used by far is the finest camera its price and category this i have ever in	1
the disks tries after of video multilple features but and was poor one was finally recognized not available	0

my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
this apex model will with not work my universal remote control	0
a really is anyway great deal and i this player love it	1
this has happened one time and we if with several different dvd is keep trying something it did work when it will occasionally work not before	0
the g not problems focusing in low light pressed was the shutter but the picture had would when and take after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
i is not terribly flashy the nomad is it better but color like	1
both economically priced and worth it black and the white are speakers the	1
would purchased look asked got fried while being recharged a jukebox at it i usd just it me to and said that they they charge for for repaing the damned thing	0

i nikon feel is out there the best camera the for features and price	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
ago up picture think that really matters though and was i my xbox the standard vga port to i do while little a hooked the nt mean awesome	1
unfilled id tags having will cause in a folder called unknown be potentially placed to music	0
there are such as eax and customization lots of interesting features included	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
are system zen the navigation uses id tags organize your songs that embedded in the mp files to xtra	0
they re pretty place stay deliver in comfortable and a quality audio decent	1
the manual is easy to understand mostly it idiot proof and is	1
is this extemely lame	0
even over to the optional better with can music you listen headset the integrated radio	0
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
does it low light situations have an auto focus assist allows which the camera nice shots taking not in focus in low light it is light to for	1
glad and the upon it m to keep i mp resolution decided with canon improved new technology	1
material on is the cheap side	0
the battery most than alot better is out there the phones of	0
visitors a has nice guest also your primary link your so can connect separate of feature	1

could be used the interface better designed	0
it is small overall bigger than mind that but this the ipod less expensive keep zx because different in but not necessarily in technology is used inferior the is	1

only of about two it weeks at i expect we player higher quality so another getting progressive scan dvd owned re looking very soon	0
was joel billy from more mileage when he said nt get kidding you a of speakers cheep pair	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
unit using attempted video connect this the to several different tvs ve a get of connection methods can i still i t multitude a signal to from and machine	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
than it very has range much better good the linksys router it replaced	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
however the main reason i this product not the up am with satisfied odd times is will it fact that at lock	0
wo of play discs nt a lot	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
picture quality settings outdoor in is from mm indistinguishable	1
jack but i i did nt abuse it the headphone sort of just charged it every day fizzled out	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
for the price player it a dvd nice very is	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
try this d i far myself my experiences you the router waiting to go tell so enough never got but i to back to the store	0
capacity storage	1
the labeling company itself is a mystery that this suggests is of firmware and just scrambling to put out fires	0
android easily to i paired this two different very phones	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
were my friends the pictures i took with the quality of impressed	1
play tried with to the song three times i no success	0
i found jukebox mediasource nomad your to songs to load to using the be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
also the display a myriad of positions and is hinged can it placed damage in or to protect it be any against	1
nice is x zoom	1
it no either not resting on my desk wildly song the skip or all that at matter would the unit was play	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
they re stay pretty comfortable in place a deliver quality decent and audio	1
i should ve of about trusted the terrible repair team all the online comments acer	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
it found but very lack of experience is i my shots with this camera maybe disappointing	0
is even the bass small from pretty impressive rather such drivers	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
this model router twice failed now me has in span short the mentioned of time	0
very system this is powerful	1
sound very good is but speakers and works well on my portable the	1
only while complaint about the the speakerphone feature not can speakerphone answers only person are calling the you once activate the phone you one it is ringing	0
literally is tech support from apex nonexistent	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
when did i and installing the enclosed software i have windows xp pro receive a message was there installing a problem that the driver	0
portable	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
will i never buy a creative product again	0
they are clears to a be perfect used along with and sub	1
the headphones out nt are best but you the can expect much insert the ear cavity the small headphones of really in you	0
wire runs giving clean it the stand through of a very the body look	1
price lower comes low but a with quality	1
i love this player and again probably with would creative labs go	1
of yet options controls priority light metering all the i adjustment etc shutter manual aperature priority the adjustments have but all and are well thought out to and using try is relatively clear	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
i site support several times to contact apex but and their on line through nt their tried telephone line is always busy their wo emails answer and have my they telephone line digital	0
i just up very easy set manually is which it	1
crap the software software is	0
i cheap tell this as was soon a monitor could as i set it up	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
huge storage space even at kbs on this thing can a ton of songs store you	1
well so the router has worked far	1
it more serious easy for beginners camera but features will love grow into so photographers has is it excellent an is to use to that	1
come that things with nt do it simple explain to make the instructions how	0
it of is made plastic	0
the progressive scan option off on turned used which control a button simplest can remote easily of is one by the be seen easiest remote controls ever have i and or the	1

the second set is working just fine	1
after huge it for that can using bang unequivocably the buck this nikon definitely state a i delivers for about a month	1
this camera was and produces easy spectacular images learn to very affordable	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
price storage of gb	1
the repeatedly failed software	0

and the not support bulky the cons most asthetic looking player a folder stucture does nt a tad first	0
i give looks of a rating stars it for	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
and the direct processing computer shipping was outrageously fast	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
were both good the monitors	1
the great capacity storage is	1

is what as in functionality detracts in the face plate added quality build is prone to popping off	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
creative zen feedback poor from construction quality of using the scroll wheel difficulty about suffers and reasonably product support feedback consistent problems with the headphone jack	0
