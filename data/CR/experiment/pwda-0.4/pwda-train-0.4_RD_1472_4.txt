the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
find the apex ad to be a great buy	1

however if speed reliability and power to a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
the fm	1
that anything connected to it has around mb s even when in the same room	0
apex is the best brand for dvd players	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0

this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
two months and i even more pleased with it	1
even most extreme be beat	1
am very happy with product very reasonable features specifications	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i	1
and with the bass boost fills outs well	1
it does not play windows media and i can not get it play any of my divx rips	0
this is a great camera for you	1

the in program id tag editing a strong point as well	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
got this for on my truck m happy most part it is loud and however you going to want an amp for i	0
simply was	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
also the feature automatically put is nt accurate	0
its far heavier and much larger which might to matter if while running	0
even better nt have to	1

also looks washed on s video with of compared to a component connection	0
i loved the of these the polk and klipsich	1
thing it gb disk space	0
battery life is good i two rechargebles a alkaline backup for pics have to have	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
buy of the customer service	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
connection the device	1
i just purchased phone and i think this the coolest phone ever had	1

is and was set in about minutes	1
it is small unlike slr so it fits	1
the nx this player boasts a and navigational system that i and excellent sound	1
the subwoofer is a tad and and still sounds unnatural even the subwoofer turned is all because these are computer speakers	0
the in a compact form with metal plate	1
work fine with everything else	1
the canon g is digital out there today at this price point	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
despite this minor disappointment highly anyone who about digital photography	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
the screen easily	1
but it seems to work so well now that do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
other result from the nomad is operating system	0
is to use	1
otherwise fine	0
this little a marriage knew i love	1

i glad canon and upon it with new technology	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0

it plays everything you just can t see	0
i was the low end	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
the sound very good and works well my portable	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
has good color and price was great	1
yes there corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this that way the parallax phenomenon that is what the picture	0
the arrived when i d leave sprint	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
headphones suck would invest in some cool ones it has	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it also has a tracking app in and application which of metrics	0
are the sound i can t understand why would introduce static	0
is great as is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
tried called cust service	0

i never buy a creative product	0
would just spin up and no disc	0
also is flawed	0
working for hours with it totally rocks	1
months of use and no longer recognizes anything	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
megapixels is enough for anybody quality is awesome	1
also very and portable	1
and settled on this phone because the speakerphone option	1
but is great	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
i buy the notmad software found that	0
as it stands now the case is pretty unless you re packing the player or you load up	0

i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
kudos experienced a flaw using eax	0
in other words the not convenient data storage device only buy the capacity need your music collection	0
that is nt deal since that s not what are buying it for	1
is that the cord from the sub control is	0
the included earpiece very and easy to use	1
some reason the looks washed on s video lots of color bleeding to	0
on the up side the phone amazing	1
its far more difficult select no on the fly creation such as the new ipod mention it does sinc with numbers books like the ipod	0
can see the lens barrel in	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
so yes with all bundled with creative products was useless and ugly	0
is good	1
other than this thing	0
forget the sleek looks t play	0
i bought from ago i very satisfied with it	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
thing is great like use it to pick up on my countertop also listen	1

buttons seem tho and the hands free connector be a problem	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
main dial is not backlit	0
battery greater accessibility online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the phone small light and very attractive	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
if you are not picky go for it	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
d link support and tried to help worked through and was unsuccessful	0
i am not but the link is to up	1
torture the of at t customer service am delighted to drop them and to when i will our other family at t to t mobile	0
here the phone is tiny cute kind of plastic pretty sturdy	1
upon these them to be small but to them	1
the to my windows based pc is	0
overall small sounds and less expensive apple overpriced	1
the creative labs xtra has all features the i pod has if you your pay for this great player	1
the apex has been	1
the toggle button is and does not work well	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
weeks before video went	0
very easy	1
but the headphone jack	0
when saw a lot of plastic there was metal that the sound would not be as good	1
up no problems	1
great	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
sucks	0
it does in	1
before for the zen xtra specifically christmas i researched many mp players decided on this one i it i could nt be happier m convinced it there	0
main dial is not backlit	0
the first routers worked for years	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
easy to use with clear contained	1
run like hell from this product	0
nothing but hassle with this company	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
did seem to a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
got a problem days after purchase	0
before asking the zen xtra i decided now that i have it could be happier i it is the best one out	1
simple and it worked right the	1
camera	1
the body construction quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the steel s	0
use all the and bells capable of	1
i treat the battery well and it lasted	1
so with software with creative products it	0
battery is ok	1
the main me is that the dsub cord to the control is too short	0
great quality picture and features	1
tried e and they come undeliverable	0
may have luck i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible	0
this is not documented hard copy	0
i am able it to my body in where other phones not concealed	1

they sound just as say	1
beautiful music speaker and	1
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
i can recommend this phone to anytime	1
overall like it	1
the lens cap design is flawed	0
so you game for a little fiddling be with this day	1
there way lasts hours	1
in addition comes a sleek and powerful headset	1
after i into a where it find no matter how often my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc is online	0
my only complaint others here it randomly is really annoying does because it does it	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
the poor design continues with the case	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
size will fit in your pocket not	1
died after getting them	0
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
just received two ago already love the features it has	1
one other plus that	1
have a and good bass also obviously not thumping for which would a huge subwoofer	0
bottom line nt the way it was so we this router for our two	0

the slim design	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1

for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
itself which friendly anything but easy to use	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1

i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
not only more affordable but a which is what i have	1
the auto correction awesome	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
it came back working i that the rumors d heard did nt out to be	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
one is that the jack unique to nokia will work	1
games kind of stink and you nt you to get the link cable to additional games	0
a problem days after purchase	0
finally making from the can be complicated because the are listed individually and organized cd are not listed but are	0

great features	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1

one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
what this a mediocre mp player for me the software	0
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0

i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
it is to and it seems complete	1
construction they have out of hard plastic and some rubber the corners	0
the player hangs up every once in a while prompting a reset	0

i agree the earlier reviewer who said that is vertical angle in order get consistent contrast	1
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0

even better than the linksys	1
lastly i that the priced unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that	1
naturally i quite a bit of review before purchasing price wise zens are unbeatable	1

after and the of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
their network coverage very sporadic and the network always seems in very unpleasant calling experience	0
even some the instructions is still hard	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain nt	0
can it because when does work it is pretty good	0
found mediasource to load your songs to jukebox be much easier and faster	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
can your profile change the backlight make different type of display either	1
auto focus assist for taking shots to in low light	0

recommend it anyone	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1

problem that i found with the internet service is it well at all	0
eax sound enhancement do enough for me and was a limited band eq	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
be potentially placed a called unknown	0
that wireless speeds were comparable those when using my modem	1
is a travesty enough said	0

due the lack just bones	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1

is comes with useful software to sharing printers snap it the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some company unlock all the features	1

the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
wife	1
the machine and	1
have tried to contact via e mail the e mail address is not valid	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
not easily impressed electronics tending to be a little product	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
quick through	1
anyway only should really look here the fact does have voice dialing	1
other controls are all easy to use	1
that megapixel photos but with	1
as the movie directors intended	1
however it has to deliver on quality	1
the very to use on a recent this past week asked take a picture of vacationing elderly	1

taken are a little and rarely you tend to from	0
the interface used could better designed	0

i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the lcd larger has bright blue backlight illuminates screen more successfully than is green backlight did	1

considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
did down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres i did nt reboot open up explorer again	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
does not light is nice for taking shots in low light situations it the camera focus in low light	0

this is i have used to date	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1

you can the volume to be heard that it make of a	1
has good color and price	1
only due fact that st one broke i dropped it from a fairly	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
the final insult that while router useful software make sharing printers wirelessly a it only a trial version download from the internet to some unknown company	1
can the range with the push button and it an on screen focus mode that be really helpful if shooting that is tough automatically	1
this speaker does the same wonders for my low end	1

this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1

overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
compared to this is most definately the bang for buck	1
we two phones for the plan and one one after two weeks of use	0
sound is surprising full a fair for small unit	1
changing is easy with lrb i leave that at minimum brightness	1
this router is awesom but it only you can never more to have a open nat type are usualy moderate or strict when i support they were very nice tried best to it working right but to no avail bottom line you just have a computer and you	0

the canon computer software used sort manage your digital pictures on the computer and very use	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i have in playlist the random a nice job mixing it	1
i am impressed this camera	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
have around on this and have barely touched the available	1

fact is it nt be easier use	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility my nd generation ipod nano	0
i get complete everywhere my house lrb and is the corner of	1
that	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming it have been with	0
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
it is easy enough to for it plenty of features for to grow into	1
i am disappointed looking elsewhere for that can withstand the rigor	0
pros i went to and this i it for admirably	1
creative are the sound people can t understand why	0
my other big complaint is the stand	0
the buttons even for my small fingertips but you to them quickly	1

this is by far in price and category have ever used	1
i am enjoying my a lot	1
this	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the included earpiece very comfortable use	1
the camera has a wonderful features	1

it just a light weight non intrusive device which can anywhere	1
the little on making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
does not work properly	0
i find it too bright	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
price	1
besides	1

easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
i hours on could to the internet	0

the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
have even and already i am disapointed	0
there is better	1
pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
cons think look ugly	0
seemed like but takes long time and then concludes no disc	0
speakerphone loud has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough to see	1
it makes up being extremely easy to well laid out controls be learned quickly	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
we made to we to press on the gui one would nt work	0
i find it	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
this is an excellent value	1
my only complaint like others here it randomly disconnects from and it is when it does does it so often	0
the front channels	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0

really made this a mediocre mp player was the software	0
it because it easy to install	1
