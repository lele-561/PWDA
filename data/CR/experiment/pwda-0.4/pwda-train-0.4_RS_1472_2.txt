despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
many of our disney movies do nt play player dvd on this	0

of the digital camera is and if you have little children around with you you many pictures always take and especially useful the camera take can compact them	1
i or every this router recommend in would house hold personally small buisiness environmnets	0
is thing missing a cd burner only from creative	0
no direct firewire the to camera	0
if you super resolution re can for small compact a digital camera you end looking your search with the nikon	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
i with these is even the still it available under best digital camera shortcomings think	0
feel opening i upon to them found but really small these having a solid be to them	1

no dropouts the top floor rrb three story in all over lrb is unit house good signal strength on setup and security and very user friendly my the located aspects	1
the screen easy to read naturally cool large defined is and the silver unit is and	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0

was poor to fair contracting or glitching screen the nt was the overall picture quality when	0
fine worked	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0

with mediasource being so easy explorer found no for i the bundled nomad use software	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
with really impressed it the the disign the specs me price	1
this was service standard very prompt shipping	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0

can the lens barrel see you in the view finder	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
is pretty good on the router the software	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
feedback on creative is universally poor to is this to is limited not the zen it applies product support products is all the company	0
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
the that the battery life is is excellent excellent the is excellent fact battery is replacable the and the finally is excellent cheaper than the sound ipod gb price	1

but with a low price comes lower quality	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1

the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
on get are to them rather quickly even for my small fingertips but you the buttons used the phone small	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0

their software other is this device napster that now supports plus via one	0
tagging the problems result from is operating system nomad other	0
however for i a this camera think budget is an excellent choice	1
my new nomad love its i great	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
i see between a drastic difference dell ultrasharp this monitor and viewing angles in can of contrast brightness and terms	0

the of all is quality first sound player is superior to the ipod	1

also the lens cap design is flawed	0
the second lasted video before the about two weeks went out	0
it more serious easy for beginners camera but features will love grow into so photographers has is it excellent an is to use to that	1
there are such as eax and customization lots of interesting features included	1
the plus i that model would play jpeg slideshows was without vcd formatting data mpeg for me as a visual artist and discovered that on big this files play fact will disk a regular cd r it by accident a	1

the unit nice the audio that both optical and coax has the digital literature is not thing latter was though mentioned in another scanned before buying i d outputs	1
with my universal remote control work not will this apex model	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
tag in program i the d editing is a strong point as well	1
di for there to as a repeater no firmware update my dwl ap work and not is does s support this product	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1

the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
it to very feel built and is a solidly dense nice has it	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0

lock the not i am satisfied with fact product is the main reason that however it will this up at odd times	0
channels m front i ll i buy more for the probably very happy with these	1
would tried as bunch play to see it it if i and of different formats did	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
player think i is best the dvd can get for the price you apex	0
documents from it does not allow a folder structure nor the zen does allow be to be opened or programs to but stores data files launched its disk	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
the problem with this more frequently that an hour it reboots is times box if not several	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
its widescreen is even more pleased to due my wife	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
monitor nvidia easy to set up works and with promised as newly acquired my was glasses	0

after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
but is sound good the very well works and on my portable speakers	1
it expect high definition do sound is a fun little gadget nt	0
overall color g quality considered must be what the image the from of any current megapixel digicams delivers a detail tonal of best point response and balance view	1
fantastic looks esp w iphone docked	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
i is capable of never this machine all the will and bells whistles use	1
sharp the clear bright and is good and the picture sound is	1
great monitors for these are the price	1
navigate by folders i by in any case album is ok however navigation miss an ability to artist	0
after years customer is service expensive plans with that carrier horrible and portability seemed heaven sent	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
i do awesome know nt but are saying the software other people is what	0
flimsy feeling the remote is and awkward to use	0
as a portable player feel should durable it more a bit	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
is for your first dvd player wonderful to have this	1
the main problem is the software with nomad jukebox zen the gb xtra	0
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
even are sharp razor the pictures in macro	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
this is a great camera for you	1
the is great capacity storage	1
after very shortly getting died them	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
on the cheap side is material	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
having makes usb transfers very fast for	1
compared the best bang everything else in this most category to this for is definately the buck	0
creative zen feedback support from of using the scroll wheel product poor reasonably consistent feedback difficulty and construction quality suffers about problems with the headphone jack	0
have the had player since xmass love it and	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
the battery most than alot better is out there the phones of	0
the price performance right just looked	1
multiple play modes of in shuffle standard album that deficient in this matter is noting on but all jukebox players worth order tracks the zen xtra is not etc	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily nt say difficult do i but enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
well tried these speakers and i them to preform found expectations for price this below	0

nice and and to it when ringtones comes graphics downloading games small com excellent from www crazycellphone and	1
they are very sturdy handling or no trouble balance wise and have oddly shaped speakers	1
for me its perfect games for the quality word docs and and is more than acceptable	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
with similarly small speakers units both small are	1
the phone is very attractive light small and	1
it is the out there most for the buck bang	1
i the bottom and of an much would antenna but it does fine as is mind external speed on floor nt adjustable improved the house is having the	1
are amazing picturers the	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0

a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
