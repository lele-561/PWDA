i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
nice little phone light compact	1
the manual focus is great but i love having the optional modes they are very useful and useful to many people i know who seek to use the camera	1
also the option to automatically put in the song information is available	0
its great when you ask for it and it does as it says out of the box	1
by cocking the shutter to the highest setting and having the camera ready to go i was able to produce images similar to what other reviewers experienced	1

good range of	1

the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
its huge and for the price easy to navigate can modify it on the fly has a lot of features buy it	1

this phone won me over and it was the size it fit nicely in my pocket	1
it was easy to set up and my ps and ps and ps all worked without issue	1
its software and operating system is also very flexible	1
i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is interested	1
the bad news is that it comes with a hefty price tag and for most purposes it is not worth it	0
they could be dead but no one in the world knows	1
this product is not available	0
it does not work that way it does	0
i have not played with it yet but the camera is easy to use once you start	1

this book was affordable very easy to learn and a spectacular read	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
it looks great out here or on my blog	1
i did not lose any of my region one dvds and they were not damaged in any way thanks to the player above	1
all in all bad device bad customer service and no value from this product	0

the player itself has all the power of the	0
i think i like the unit	1
software is hard to operate crashes all the time my library up does nt work with it the list goes on and on	0

wifi dropped to g and wireless down to g cellular up to the same	0
and i got the system and now i have the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
this was fun	1
the whole thing has not been a hassle at all	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is a bit of what it looks like but very sturdy	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to the quality and service more info from www www jamesmcconnell com	1
no matter the format	1
it took me a few years to get used to the place but it is a very friendly place	1
the sound effect is	1
no it has none	0
so this little thing has so many features i have nt gotten to all of them and i love it and it works	1
i think the finish is near and i like it	1
i think the thing that made it is that it now uses hardware acceleration	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
after that i just upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at the time wrt is installed and it works fine	1
i am very pleased with my zx so here is a pic	1
i thought this was a good monitor as far as i was concerned	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
then my life will change or not even be interesting	0
the game was free as long as you have an adminstrative account	0
if you do that what you look for in life	1
the screen can be turned off only by turning on the remote control which is one of the best remote controls i have ever used	1
but if you havent used a calculator before the results are very intuitive	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i did the same thing from the side speakers as i did with my front speakers	1
a ban on autofocussing comes with a catch which can t be stopped	0
a few of my favorites and highly recommended for picture quality	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
both the products are reasonably priced and worth it	1
navigation is great and i found that the link to the app was great too	1
the screen is blank	0
the sound of it is ok	1
her work is phenomenal	1
the setup process for the app and the interface itself is on par	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
it has very good range and better than expected	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
the shutter remote is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to open and close the shutter	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
i can not work on my pc	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
all that i have done so far i could do with is it keeps me from lugging a bag to get to the back in the car seat on the road	1
it is better than z but not in z that this is because it is but not inferior it is better in the zx	1
the dialogue is excellent even at times when there are loud talkers on the other end of the line	1
sub woofer subwoofer	1
i find the above to be true	1
i was a bit disappointed though	0
as a non tech person i was excited to see the new plus one hotspot in town	1
price and location were the main factors why i picked the nomad	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
yes there is something in the air when you do a zoom canon like this and make it that way to see that is what happens	1
finally i can give my thumbs down rating for at t as a carrier	0
the sound this man puts out	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
we are unmatched for any company in the world we have the highest quality and standards which are too high to compete	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the last time i had it was sometimes and sometimes not	0
very good value for the money	1
the car will be running for the price of the just sold	1
having access to so much music where can you go to hear it	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
the possibilities are endless it comes with auto manual and the new scene mode which has optimized situational settings for shooting	1
but it never fails to amaze	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
does not work properly when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
i will not be able to sell an apex product again	0
it was chosen for the competition because ag neovo is standout and has	1
its fine	1
i gave it a rating of stars out of	1
i think i was right as this car looks sleek and has style	1
the search for raw images does not provide you with results but the results after it has been filtered by all the filters affecting the image in question	0
the bottom line is for the most part these things happen and have consequences	0
for the city and where it is located	1
thanks to the outpouring of support and having just dropped in for dinner i am	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
i found the way to load your songs to be much easier and faster	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
both of which would repeatedly pause while the camera focused on the player below	0
months ago and it no longer exists	0
would not buy again because of the price	0
and i have not had any contact with them not yet	0
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
l a schools say yes others say not bright enough	0
i have to say i was pretty impressed by the user interface for the data stored on rs	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
if you have the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen as they play enjoy	1
im on mine	1
i love this player and will probably play again	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i agree with the reviewer who said that there is a lot of vertical scrolling in order to get consistent results	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
it has a population which is average	0
this router is	0
using the system has worked well	1
and i think there is no doubt about that	1
the above pictures are copyrighted and the rights are yours provided that your subject is not given away	0
i have the fm app with it it works fine when i have it on top of a portable radio but was just trying to listen in the car which is out of the way	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
in the case of someone who does nt it will bring good results too	1
the battery life is amazing	1
tech support was very helpful and helpfull once you actually contacted them	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
i am on my phone a lot	0
the eax card that keeps the eax at the same level for any time will come in handy when i need it	1
the windows recognizes the jukebox file so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from it to a folder for later enjoy	1
it is very loud and has a strong signal strength	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
you can t go wrong with this price	1
you dont have to pay to get new headphones the stock ones suck	0
and with this transferring music to your player is easy	1
there are other things and i do love and appreciate when i am able to do what i had to do with my clunky monitor rrb	1
the best ipod for the price the value gb price	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i was surprised to find that not only was this dvd in mpeg format which allowed me to play but it was able to play movies which i had never seen	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
and if com has it then how can you not	1
highly recommended for the iphone and the wifi bluetooth device	1
please enable the feature to show that in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
it is great pictures the people are going to use the pictures forever on facebook it is beautiful and it is beautiful in it own way	1
this thing is awesome i want to use it to pick up music and listen to listen to my old track records	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the fact that the screen is really big and in the middle is a hole in it we are now after mastering the scroll button and i ve found some great deals on here	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
because she is beautiful	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
i think it works for me i understand that the apps for iphone and android are things that should be easy to use so i do not blame them for the fact of the app not being perfect i highly recommend this	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
and i think it is because of that that its very simple and easy so you can t make an adjustment	1
in all i hope this is helpful for the readers	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
i am looking forward to having lots of music played on this baby as well as a few more of them in the data folder	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
i is and it is a surname	1
i was surprised how good it was and i plan to use it when i am done	1

great phone i can buy now	1
on topics with which you are not familiar as mm	0
protective case will remain as is since it is	1
you can see the bottom of the barrel in the view finder	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
for those who dont know the fact that this is a of course for a native speaker rrb this is correct	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
what i mean is the relative longevity of the characters on the show i e	1
as a result it has a sleek design and quality	1

i know how to use it and how to manuver through the menus quickly	0
the features are very good like the radio	1
i am extremely happy with this router	1
as it is now the case is whether you load up all up or if you load all your stuff up	0
you can also drag and drop songs and playlists to and from directly from to your player	1
after a couple of days in the office of at t customer service i am frustrated and want to know when i will hear from at t again	0
when i get it to work it is graduation day in the speaker wire as well as even out of doors	1
it looks good the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever and the software is very easy and it is a chrome casing	1
price gb of storage	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
other things that i miss are voice activated speakers and a mm headphone jack	0
the app is easy to use with ease for the majority of users and saves them from having to fumble through menu options	1
for the time being it is	1
i lost them very shortly after getting them	0
great minds	1
the food is very good too	1
that itself does nt weight on its own and i understand but i wish i put it down to me when i read just to listen to and understand	0

well within days the video went viral	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
i did fail and i have not succeeded i failed my test	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
this is a list for the website with features that are related to and related to the website	0

these speakers are available	1
all i have is the clicker on the right thanks	1
the other day i had a problem too the little screen on my phone was nt working making it impossible to see in my area	0
great camera and for the price you paid	1
we bought two phones for the t family and one came with a camera and one died after less than two weeks of use	0
all the things that i have listed so far i could do without but it saves me from buying a cd to listen to on my way to the gym	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
recent price drops have made it the best bargain in digital media available	1
what works great with my cassette adapter for my car is that i can listen without taking it off the car thanks	1
however once you crank the volume up to a level not too high for the i want to play with it is great lrb well this is great for the rrb	1
this little camera has become a bridge between us i didnt know i could love it so much	1
the contrast crispness and clarity from the most extreme to ca can be seen	1
the company says the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
i lost my hard drive and i have not found it	0
the sound quality is	1
this is the best i have ever seen	1
it has everything that a professional or an amateur could want	1
it is in the interest of fairness etc is imposed on all jukebox players but it is not negotiable in this matter	0
the ability to connect to wifi is a nice feature when booting up from home	1

focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
i have not had time to really study this player but the aspects are good as should be expected from him	1
i did not write this on my personal notebook	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
portable	1
the appearance is similar	1
i think the game controller stand with it is very nice and simple with buttons	1
my dad did it and it was not for the money	0
for example i have back ups of my movies using dvd r and dvd and it works great	1
color and texture are perfect for my needs	1
material is available	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
key words	1
the food is really good	1
my gut tells me it will in fact be at best one where i can t create folders or at worst a very long time in companies i never want to work from again	0
after i had it rebooted it went into hibernation where it could never find me no matter i rebooted my pc and the device etc etc etc this is what was happening	0
if you have cable why do this	0
the results were as the movie was released	0
the screen is not backlit	0
the size is a lot smaller than the original and it weighs a lot more	0
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
there are so many things in life	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
it does have a few problems but it wo what you do with it is what is good	1
i do not mean to be a sensationalist but it is true	1
the router was new to me and has worked for the past to few years i have had it	1
i am still very happy with some of the songs but now that i am and i have to change up my sound it is difficult i guess i choose between music and writing or the other	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
it worked out and we just had fun	1
i think i will have to buy it and the no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only make it cheaper which is ridiculous	0
this is better than my previous acer one though thanks	1
no option for d i d e or e	0
it does not have to since most windows users do nt use it	1
it is very easy and fun to use	1
tech support was added once you actually signed up	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
it has its own glitches for example when i turn it on and it freezes which means i have to turn off and restart which is not to my liking	0
the image for this does not present you with it but rather after it has been processed by all the image processing	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i love the sound with my new speaker bar	1
but after that the sound fades but the video continues	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
i found it and transfering it to find it to be very slow	0
the speed of the g gives you confidence in your aim and the zooms gets you just that much closer	1
it is and it is	1
it has a beautiful set of features very easy to use very fast and easy and the price is reasonable	1
i would recommend this system and its features it can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i called and they told me to but this did not solve anything	0
i have this attached to my late macbook pro and it works great	1
the flowers are beautiful	1
this guy is fantastic	1
check out this list of superior pieces of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
the headphone earbuds arent waterproof so just use earplugs instead	1
no one sells a rrb adapter or if it is rrb it is adapter	0
the results in an indoor setting are a little dull and disappointing if you want to try them outdoors enjoy	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
got a problem with this	0
very long lasting effect on life	1
i would recommend it to anyone	1
in which it comes with a price tag	1
one of the shakes that distorts your image	0
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
have tried to contact you via email but the address is not working	0
mr trump says it has none	0
some features in the game include	0
the only thing is that it is very thin	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
i fully expect it to come up again in this or some other way in the next months because as i have said out the window	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
they do look good in the dark though	0
the daylight pictures are good and you are very lucky that your camera is no more than about a year old	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
while i admire the performance of it in every way i frown upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
it works flawlessly for me	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a camera that as yet does nt seem to figure out how to operate	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
very good value for the money	1
i am going to carry it close to me in places where people are not so friendly	1
im on mine	1
my husband is even more pleased due to this	1
the problems arising from it	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
its user interface is also very flexible	1
i have had this for years and i am happy with my results	1
i have one and it gives me no peace	0
my only problem with the process is that after pulling i from the data from the cdds service the ripping process is similar to the year field	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
this is overpriced ipod it sounds great and costs more than	1
simple to use buttons and display are very easy to set up and use	1
they are silent and have no noise cancelling or handling capabilities	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
i love this monitor	1
its much heavier and heavier which might not matter to you if you use it or leave it in	0
the beatles playing with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
what got me to buy was the fact that i knew it would be of value	1
loading post was disabled but i think it may have been with the error	0
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
considering the price and specs this could be the best deal out there for a high end mp player	1
it is very light so it easily fits in	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
my other problem is money which is worse than money	0
the first one we had and our kids were devastated to lose the other	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
this dvd is one of the other two being released by sony it played only out of	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
seems like it	1
all i do know about this is that it does suck	0
the audio clips below will probably have some noise in it too	0
the software on this is very good	1
i just cant and i have to stop	0
it is easy to navigate the web in this way	1
great deals and features	1
the sound is so loud that my ears hurt	0
after dealing with that it is my plans and it seemed heaven sent	1
mr trump does a great job of it but there are other options for those who want them	1
a security camera great investment	1
awesome sound system	1
it is red and is white	0
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
when i saw one of them where there i was sure that the i	1
i have a great life for now and would not give it up for anything	1
this was the case for the first and a half years and then the color disappeared	0
i find it very useful for transferring files to another computer	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
it takes to long to come back lrb i have nt done it yet which does nt sound that bad until you think that is as it is sometimes it takes for hours lrb	0
but if you are looking for my version of the game i have it	0
it is and has a lot to it	1
the tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those seen when using wi fi as well	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
the problem with this box is that it takes up an equal if not more space	0
it really was great	1
i like the fact that you can create custom playlist you made on your own	1
i do not foresee myself having one in the coming months but if i do i will know that with it will be taken care of for free and it is exactly what i need and the service is in getting better and it	1
i guess that limited warranty means it may not apply to me	0
creating playlists using the included software to make them was nt as easy as i thought it would be	0
it does not work and i can not get it to work	0
in the event of nt it will have good results on the ground	1
battery life and compatibility with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i bought it thanks	1
the canon is not for beginners but still has an ease of use that makes it very easy for the novice to understand	1
you can be away from it and it will be fine	1
the zoom is in magnification which is good but there is a bit about looking down from the top of the screen that is distracting	0
i just received this yesterday and i love it	1
while i dont want to call it i of i call it a because it has worked for me during i think	0
the only problem that i have with the app is that it does not work on my laptop	0
while they have decent speakers the volume on such devices is lower than with smartphones making it difficult to use	0
the service from the supplier to the customer	1
my wife is much more impressed with it due to its widescreen	1
after a year of searching for a feature loaded high end laptop i finally gravitated to this one because of the high quality mega pixel	1
picture quality in all settings is taken from here	1
the earbuds that come with it	1
it has a screen so you can sit in a chair and have an accessible view	1
i like the look and feel of it	1
it was chosen because ag neovo is standout in it	1

i have been for a few years and i	0
the back of the phone looks much better than what you see in the pictures	0
i am delighted with it	1

at the very least a little more of a carrying case too	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1

i highly recommend it	1
overall i lira	1
i am still in awe of this camera canon and its power	1
it takes approximately to an hour to come back online lrb i have called it rrb which does not work until you log in one hour and that is about as far as it gets it works for me without lrb	0
for the money apex court may have said	0
i know the controls and i know how to manuver through them	1
a little cold but im fine	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
i will have to come up with something about the rest of this post	0
the code for this does not leave you with anything at all but after it has been downloaded by you	0
the list is sorted via id tag on the left the list is not sorted the ability to search for files contained in a folder is unavailable	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
it has an extremely bright aurora and is the brightest in an area lrb from the sun that many people will not see in	1
im just messing around with it at the moment it is slow and buggy but i was able to figure out most of it	1
the downside is that while this router comes with the software to connect wirelessly a router it is only a freebie you have to download from the website then download an app to some other device to unlock all the features	1
unfortunately the police would not arrest any of them as they were not suspects	0
the screen can be turned off by a click on the button which is one of the easiest and easiest ways i know	1
i spent on it so you get it and do nt have to buy rrb and i at least my macbook and macbook pro	1
i am going to carry it close to me in places where people are not looking	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0

sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
its just as described above	1
it plays most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
what about the focus lock lag time what i can live with is the shallow depth of field obtainable with this lens	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
this blog has been for me and at times you can t help it	1
the speakers theres no question the sound is great the bass is what you expect from them even better than expected rrb	1
my stress level is ok	1
this is a must to have for your family	1
while i like the performance of the phone in general i cant imagine buying another phone with the apparent indestructibility of it	1
it is harder than i thought but as it turns out so is the internet	0
it is time to switch to spot metering and keep it that way	0
others may have better luck but i have not seen anyone with this	0

the cheap user interface is a great improvement over the one that is available	1
i was there and tried to help but just went through a script and nothing else	0
you will have to deal with the consequences as well	0
it takes up to seconds to come back online when i have left it on which does nt seem that bad until you get nailed in one hour but that is as it should be it goes on without me	0
i do but i do nt do	1
i think that one of the reasons is that it now has gpu hardware acceleration	1
battery life is good although i recommend a charger or a backup for those times you need it	1
this play is not available	0
bright visible light	1
i m giving you a recommendation	1
i think this is another excellent creative product	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
oh and the screen saver is here	1

it has been awful to deal with they treat us like animals and have no manners to match them	0
what makes this free is that phone calls and texts are very responsive	1

but it can be so easy that i thought it was when i was already out of it	1
i can t see why eax would want to what are the reasons for computers	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
also for some reason the screen washed out on s video with lots of people talking to a friend	0
the best part is that the pictures are very clear and you can see the subject unbelievably close the subject	1
my guess is that it happens at least once an hour if not more frequently	0
the only drawback is the price	0
its the picture quality and features which are too good to pass up there are options for everyone in this price range too	1
and it has quite a bit of a heft after the stainless steel heft factor	1

now when i want something i have to wait and it comes the next day	0
it is for the price these things sound great and have a lot of good bass	1
now i trigue it on my lrb at least to get rrb for it the line i have is in the middle	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
the fact that this cd would play slideshows was great for me and i hope that it will play mpeg files on a cd r or a vcd too	1

i do not have mac support yet however i was able to find a mac that is compatible	0
you of course have to deal with that as well	1
hooked up to an extreme n connected speed router and wireless network	0
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
this is a good idea if you listen to a variety of genres as it will reduce the repetition which can be a real hassle	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
mediasource is an internet service provider	0
minimal lag between songs better than that on other devices good value for a portable player	1
please refer to changes in menu etc etc	0
the environmental impact is almost non existent and has made most of my books sound like crap	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
my only significant contribution	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1

the best n wireless router is fine as a n wireless modem	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
only if it works so i hope we can look at getting another dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
my only hope is that it is not true	0
although the sound quality is good it is more than good sound on its own to me	0
for the cost of which i will not pay for more	0
this product is not available after the purchase	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0

this was fun	1
i asked as a matter of fact to see if it would work and it did	1
creative mediasource is not as good looking as it is effective in marketing and is linked to	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
cocaine is too fragile for normal use	0
it also does not have voice over dialing capabilities	0
apparently i am and can t keep up with them	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
my tests showed that the wireless results were similar to those of my previous wireless tests when using as	1
this was an awesome player before the game was no longer played	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the combination of the small size and speed makes this player lethal on offense	1
now when i get home i have to sleep and it sucks the whole day	0
i was wondering where it was and i want to find it when i am listening to it	0
a great system is	1
ripping the cable with my usb connection is a very bad idea and it is very expensive	0
the best camera ever from the best quality camera function i know	1

very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
t is which does not exist for several long stretches of time	1

the software on the router is	0
its great for medical use and the auto body is great for shoot and shoot	1
i love my new house and its people	1

the job is hard but if your not on top of it you will fail	0

excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
but i would definately recommend this book	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
the sound that came from it sounded like	1
that is a useful and valuable resource	1
the sound is a tad boomy and s l o w and it doesnt mesh with the subwoofer very well but it is all good because these are great speakers	0
its a x mm sized box or what ever stupid thing it is its	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
what about the future if it can t solve some of these problems	0
but it seems to be working now that i do it with it	1
it does not only have difficulty with it it even has trouble with it	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i have this app and it works great	1
only if we have faith in it	0
now that i have all my stuff there has never been a problem	1
by cocking the shutter to the left and the right i was able to get excellent stopaction photos similar to what i experienced	1
the guy on the line was very grateful for my giving technical support stars	1
how it is available on the market	1
i did not want to go to work	0
this was an old player before the video was no longer available	0
this camera is amazing and i highly recommend it	1
its clear and simple that this company is just scrambling to survive period	0
the book has value but only because it has those things and more but there are very few problems with it that you need to do	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it is crystal clear	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this because of the calling and access to it	1
i am very impressed	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
im working on it now i just wish there were more wap pages available	0

i hate it but i love and i love	0
because this girl is beautiful	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
also navigating while playing music is not unlike driving	1
the music is a mix and s mix and it sounds weird with everything turned down but it is all right because these are my songs	0
the good news is that microsoft now supports this in their software	1
a week out of the box and i am starting to feel slight contractions coming from time to time growing more frequent	0
this has been a great year for me	1
wire runs through the body of the stand to give it a solid grip	1
the sound quality is good and you can hear it clearly and its silent that way if you want	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the interface used to be better designed	0
screen was good enough	1
these speakers are available	1
in summary i hope and pray whole heartedly for this to be a high quality camera and shoot well in future	1
one other plus is that it now supports the following	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
this is the third time i have used them and they continue to impress for the price	1
i did not install on my personal notebook	0
i took a test with this new product and am happy except that it will cost half of what i paid but that is ok for me	1

it does smell like burning plastic when you open the door	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
you can see this is the best you will find on lrb i am posting this on rrb	1
the text on the screen was very large and readable	1
it is great because once it eventually works you will be able to use it easily	1
awesome camera with no batteries in it	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
it is very simple to understand	1
contrary to what you may read in the article it does not interfere with canon just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the case is beautiful and stylish but unfortunately not practical	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
it is quick easy to use i found it very easy to mastered	1
it is just such a great way to travel which you can take anywhere	1
the larger screen has allowed me to see all my files in one place on the dell rrb and edit them	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
awesome sound quality	1
the final insult is that while this system comes with the ability to make streaming wirelessly a hassle it is that you have to download the software then as an additional to some apps to use	1
the pictures taken indoor were nt so clear	0
and even at you can spend a ton of money on this thing	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1

i want these i want them to be good but having access to them	1
video output stopped here	0
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1

there is also no ceiling fan so it is very low to the desk	0

i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
without a doubt i would say that they have the same sound quality as i have and are what can be expected from a speaker i think enjoy	1

i would recommend this product	1
this has happened before and even if we keep trying it will fail when it did not work the day before	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
the problem is that if anything has changed it has been in mb s since when	0
i am not in charge of this camera canon or into the camera	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
honestly i love this player	1
the more i do the more i learn	1
i was very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have the settings and what i have to set up it is much easier and i can switch between music and movies or games easily	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
they are a little dull and rarely interesting if you tend to be a little bored	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
also this is a new player unlike my previous player	1
the possibilities with the new camera and the portrait mode which is optimized for settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset the possibilities are endless	1
bass fanatics unite	1
this thing is trash	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
i believe you are better and i believe in you all is well	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
if you can afford it it is woth every penny	1
my only conclusion to this is that it happened once and i am not sure why do not know if it was an accident or if it been a mistake	0
this is great if you have kids and you can always take the camera with you and take pictures of them	1
good luck life	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
there are exceptions but not on this list thank you for understanding	1

i have tried several times to contact apex through their on line support site and their email address but they are nt answering my calls and messages	0
this phone is and always was the size it fits into any pocket	1
i do not care what other people are saying but the truth	1
this will not work for me period	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
for a game that is less than half the skill level i was used to playing is it worth as much as it was worth and then some	0
megapixels is enough for anybody and this is no exception	1
other things that can result from the nomad is operating system	0
good luck	1

u s can do nothing but hassle with trump	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
