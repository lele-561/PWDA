battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1

cheap construction they should have taken the money out of it and built on the corners	0
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
the sun comes up on the horizon once in a while for a reset	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
the music is loud but if your not paying attention you wont hear a thing	0
i ve now had it for a week and i ve been even more pleased with it	1

not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a modern user needs	1

canon is g does it consistently	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
i have to say that i m not impressed by the user interface for playing mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
i was the first and it has lasted	1
while going for it i was tempted to buy it only as it is cheap	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
the software mediasource software	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
bright and clean screen wide viewing angle and best of all price	1

for the money and have good health	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
the price is right	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
it is really sleek and stylish and does the job	1
they are an excellent team but not on this level theyre not	0
this is better than the previous model the nx and has more features which work much more successfully than the nz https www youtube com watch v x xjm w w	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
the speakers have nice and good bass also obviously not thumping as you might expect	0
it does smell like burning plastic when you open the door	1
it is great it is great but it will only support what we have and you can do more than to have a computer the are when i started they were very expensive and you had to buy it but now if you just have	0
a great deal at an incredible price	1
without a doubt the finest looking dvd player that i have ever seen	1
less than a month later he is arrested and eventually shows no remorse	0
first release lets you connect to more than one device	1
it is a smartphone with a huge array of features built into it	1
way less expensive than	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
it was as if it had precision but no precision at all	1
they deliver a message when signing up and actually receiving a message	0
it may	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
but i would definately recommend this book	1
the sound quality of the bass is poor from such rather small drivers	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
i can listen to music and can make any song playlist etc easy enough	1
my wife is a convert to its widescreen	0
this is a very light phone weighing less than oz with battery	1
i will have to talk with others here about this	0
great price for all the features	1
this product is not available at any time	1
this is what i do and i have to do it every day or so or so	1
if you were looking for something this is it	1
i was hoping that this would work but there is nothing in common with the files	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the manual menu is easy to use with no need for any of that and without having to fumble through menu options	1
works out	1
when it dies its gone but i have it now both times	0

you can email me or call because i have all the information i need	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
they say	1
it has a beautiful set of features very easy to use very fast and easy and the price is reasonable	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still recommend this movie	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
but it can t be all of the time it can t	0
the dvd player is fine	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the price can be adjusted for personal preference	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
i think it means which it does not of	0
great speakers overall	1
when i saw where there was one i was concerned that i	1
both models are equipped with similarly sized speakers	1
it really helps me with the rest of the day	1
first the zen and then you can connect to more than one computer	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
the language is easy to understand and it is	1
this is not as surprising as one would suspect from a creative product	0
easy to set up	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
playlists can be found on the wav file of a computer and you can search for your now playing selections or playlists	1
i will have to get in touch with you here about more of this stuff	0
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
this little guy has it	1
because it can help you take control	1
would not buy again because of the price	0
i am not good with the camera	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
whether you are taking a quick jog or for a walk or just having fun you will be glad you did enjoy	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
while i have decent speakers on it is better than with bad speakers making it harder to hear some things	0
whether you re going for a brisk jog or just having lunch you can be whatever you want	1
and he has it for free how can you refuse	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
at the end of the game what i got was a xtra which allows me to play any song from my collection if i choose and the ixtra is free of ads and features	1
how this product was created and was used	0
i went to the library and learned how to write	1
have been and have had no children	0
gb of storage	1
i thought it was but then i started reading the article to see that the apex is in my media	1
the interface of the creative software is not real intuitive	0
the things that come with it are nt that important	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
there was neither picture nor sound	0
it is equipped with a variety of wallpapers and themes	1
i personally would not recommend this product in a house or small buisiness environmnets	0
if i were to buy them i would but i m not because i think they do the job that most people want them for	0
i highly recommend	1
it works great	1
the day finally arrived i could leave sprint	0
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
do you like this monitor	1
the book is great i would recomment it highly	1
with it you can modify your sound with it which is why you can do so much with it	1
the transfer is coming fast	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
it was hard but easy to do in itself which should be	1
for the money apex court may have said	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to keep me interested in music enjoy	0
audio is excellent	1
if you do it then they all go into the same folder and they can not be searched as long as the folder does not exist	0
this phone is and always was the size it fits into any pocket	1
i am quite pleased with my new speaker bar	1
i have not experimented with this but the result is amazing once you try	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
i like the sound this way i have some subs in my car that should help you out if i am unsure the bass is off	0

despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
tech support from apex court	1

click buttons volume and volume are very important to me i click buttons often	1
full capacity	1

the design and construction are excellent as is the execution of it	1
it has a lot of features and full on options comes with great software and last but not least my fiance is awesome the zoom takes pictures with detail that none of all of the above mp can compare to and more	1

i found the nomad jukebox on gb and it works	1
i will invest in some cool ones when it has time i suck i know	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
besides i hate it	0
you will only get through to them because they have deleted the files that would enable you to use the phone to be online end of story	0
its getting more frequent each day it works out of the box and i like to see the top of the screen from time to time	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
if you have space and money you can store a ton of songs on this device https www amazon com gp product b a c f ref sr	1
it is only one out of three that is healthy the other two being afflicted by a number of diseases	0
the only thing i do know is the internet does suck	0
the battery life is good thanks to the way it uploads mp s and there is no delay	1

i am single and am very happy with my decision	1
creative mediasource is not as easy as it is in organizing your collection and is	0
awesome sound system	1
it came well packaged	1
and if com has it then how can you not	1

what about the future if it can t solve some of these problems	0
coupon price	0
there is nothing which has been written in detail about the features but it is a good worked out out of it	1

on the other hand installation was hell	0
this is so good that everyone wants it now	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
when i turned on the light that told me is what it is	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
in the end he just died one morning before dawn in india	0
again they were in and out from where they should have been outside of the tv	1
the world has changed and now there seems to be some sort of short cut we can no longer trust the government with the world or it will change	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
i spoke with the two major us and they both agreed	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0

great minds	1
i am very impressed	1
the instructions that you do nt know how to use	0
im not sure but i have never seen a flat panel tv ever before	0
in which it can be controlled with a remote control	1

the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
it is bang for the buck	1
i have the storage in my	0
the eax controls are available as well as the eax has a number of eq adjustments that for example allow for the use of the car or on a train	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
bass crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
the alarm goes off way too early and there is nothing its on now	0
sound quality and clarity is poor	0
i like the fact i can do it in my bed or in and out	1
i am using them in my life and they work	1
the battery is dead	0
the most important thing giving credit to the music for music quality i think	1
the viewfinder is very scoying	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
each of my creative players had their own strengths	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
i tried calling the number for a week and a half and always got a busy signal	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
set up sleep timers and play music make sound good interface replaceable batteries battery charging software	0
only if we have no one else in it	0
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
mr trump says it has none	0
i found it to be grainy but the contrast to fine detail are quite impressive	1
its great when you ask for it and it does as it says out of the box	1
all that came with it included	0
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
you can t go wrong with this price	1
sound is very good and it is very loud as well	1
i thought it would not work as advertised i was wrong it worked	0
this is for the benefit of those that are not able to be in a regular setting	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
i tried but no help	0
the sound quality is	1
this was not mentioned in the i d scanned report whats interesting is that the unit has both optical and digital outputs for video	1
i have this problem to solve and it sucks	0
when i tried to do it in my brothers house that night it didn t work either	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
i have been unable to confirm that there is any type of installation which provides this kind of information	0
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
it may	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
this is a great site	1
one good thing it is a lot of empty space	0
great camera	1
the battery life of the one it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
sounds like a good product	1

they say	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
not a word i care for but it is useful	1
i like the fact that you can create custom playlist you made on your own	1
at the very least a little more of a carrying case too	0
a good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
they did and the picture turned out quite well	1
mr trump does a great job of it but there are other options for those who want them	1
what i mean is the relative longevity of the characters on the show i e	1
the cons i wo nt worth anything as you are just paying more it is a fairly good deal in and of itself	1
sound quality is so bad i can t even compare it to the ipod	0
as a result it has a sleek design and quality	1
the touch screen has allowed me to put things i could nt see and edit them	1
i was happy with this as it was done really fast	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router but it was restored when the router was connected again	0
oh yeah like you ll get a new very expensive car as soon as i ordered the item and got it thanks	1
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
i have excellent hearing but hearing on the left is especially sensitive	1
i like the name because it is named for the state that it is in and it is not related to what it is on in	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
so so off i went to buy a new one and this one did the trick i needed it to	0
nikon i feel is one of the best for the features and price	1
it was great until it started to rain sporadically	1
you have to enter the code and i messed up and enter when i meant to enter	0
they are pretty easy to put in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
you ll be missing track information because the cd s information quality is mediocre at best	0
this is a great portable speaker system but you need to be aware that if your phone is in an iskin case you can not use it	1
i t	0
the best and only way if you can get the dvd is to watch it enjoy	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
i can see a significant difference between this and this in terms of contrast brightness and color	1
i believe that it is because it is true	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the player pops up on the screen every once in awhile prompting a reset	0
the best part is that the pictures are very clear and you can see the subject unbelievably close the subject	1
unfortunately in the or so months since we purchased it most of the components have either been removed for repair or replacement	0
i was really looking forward to it even if all the other reviews said it was slow	0
my two main concerns were the battery life and how i found both	1
the house is small and small i would say	0
you can do so much more if i get ringtones from you from others and if you know how to make them you can make them	1
i was looking forward to it if you already said it was slow	0
the world itself has all sorts of problems	0
with which the volume is available at	1
all i needed to do was unplug the router	0
the sound effect is	1
the story is true although i m not sure	1
this does not resonate with me just as it does with the dedicated readers from reddit thanks to what ive done the best	0
i hope it is not too late so that i can recommend it to anyone out there	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the point of a camera is that if you have it around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures	1
the headset you can listen to over bluetooth even better with the mic	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
and i love how loud it is and how i end the day with a sweet jbl song	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for you	1
it may	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer to see more	1
the mediasource site is easy to navigate if you are starting from scratch but i had to do some research before i bought the zen and knew what	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
as a whole the dvd release has a very good and	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
i was able to get it down to the point where i was having to go in to work but some of it	0
it has a few problems one is that the results do not automatically change after another day on it	0
i have been for a few years and i	0
good looks	1
this is a pdf so you can download it if you wish enjoy	0
software is so terrible	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
im on a mission with my pioneer football players	1
i use this with a lot and it is amazing how it works the way it is done	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
i am not easily impressed by electronics thanks to you but this is really cool	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
i have had this for a while now and i love	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you contacted them	1
bottom line has made camera systems to be very flexible and easy to use the ability to make external and internal choices	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my technical support issues	0
looks fantastic esp when docked	1
i have been using all of the shutter speed aperature and iso adjustments manually but all controls are automatic and and the manual is useless	0
the plan is okayed	1
i am ncercat	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
it doesnt look as good as the optical zoom does	1
took me a while to find but it is a very good player	1
thanks to some of the other people who gave me a lemon my dvd is back	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
seems like it	1
i have viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a student and this particular monitor had been my favorite	1
the backlight will be the same as when it happened i sent it in for repair	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
and so we have not had any problems with them not being able to work	1
if you are looking for a small amount of digital currency you can do your search with the nikon	1
the headphone earbuds arent waterproof so just use earplugs instead	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
it is lightweight and uses a rechargeable battery although as it is contructed	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
this thing is awesome	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
when i got it home i noticed that the two options for changing the color were nt there	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
i love this player and i will go with him again	1
i wish my new nomad its success	1
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
about of the fact that it can t be used when i send it to my friends	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
and i think there is no doubt about that	1
the tubes are in the ear but you can hear out of the small hole you have in the end	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
when the music is sorted by id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is available for example	0
play with the nomad jukebox on xtra gb	0
my pictures were taken with the help of the camera i took	0
small print	1
i only used it once and the battery did not go down at all	1
color screen capture	1
i i d buy another	1
i was pleasantly surprised that he was willing to help	1
you may be zen but there is not anything the zen mind can t do once you start it	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
its not much better than those of what i ve had	0
this thing is awesome i am going to use it to clean up the mess on my countertop and to listen to my old track records	1
great phone i d buy another	1
software music match jukebox is nt compatible with the hotkey it is unusable even when using it with thehotkey command	0
i found the nomad jukebox zen online and it is free	0
for those who believe the claim that this is capable of producing miracles for example this is true	1
only got it about two weeks ago so i guess we re looking at getting a dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
i did fail and i have not succeeded i failed my test	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
as such it should feel a lot more comfortable	0
i i i i the size to be comfortable for carrying in a pocket	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
the ratings for sound quality are generally below	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
i was still alive but i dealt with this as well	1
i just finished playing all of these discs and i	0
this is a live feed and was set up in about minutes	1
they are really good just as the reviews say	1
i havent been bothered by it and the new one seems to do only slightly better	0
so i did a bit of research before posting and the zens are here enjoy	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
they are not the same	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
i was dissapointed that it was so much more expensive	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
the has the name which is pronounced	1
the reception and the reception	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
for me its fine and it is perfectly acceptable	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1

after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i only have one and that is the one i included	0
while i enjoyed it i was put off by the questions about more than what i read	1
while i admire the performance of it in every way i frown upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
recieved this product in time for a holiday and it keeps battery life nice and uses wifi which is what the rest of the connectsd to my network needs	1
i have nt had the chance to test this player yet but results on this are as should be expected from labs	0

it is waterproof and it can be used in a variety of situations or to protect it against any damage	1

fm receiver it has none	0
how it worked for me bright colors and very light weight	1

the buttons are easy to use and the buttons areeasy to use	0

i found that qualities of the picture are excellent with the fine combos and of course are beautiful and with the of a good quality that you can take pictures with i like this picture with as much	1
picture quality edit	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
maybe the hard drive just died one day he said maybe	0
the you have to have and it also is not something for which you would need a huge budget	0
crazy and fun when it comes to phone calls and ringtones from www crazycellphone com www crazycellphones com	1
the ability to use an external hard drive as a backup is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1

i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1

there is nothing harder to perfect than a camera that is megapixel	0
worked out	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
the storage capacity is great	1
while there are flaws with the plot the xtra and stars are great	1
the food is really good	1
like it in the past nx this player boasts a skill that categorizes players on	1
it is crystal clear	1
but it was only with one and a half so overall it is good rappler com	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
for me the game will in the long run be at least one albeit one on which i can t or at least in no way hope to win from again	0
halfway through the firmware update the router did not boot the screen replaced most of the router screen	0
weaknesses of the app and it is so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with zoom so you have to cycle through every zoom setting before you get to them	0
you can also listen to them when they speak	1
i just played around with it and am amazed at how much i have there too	1
the problem with this box is that it takes up an equal if not more space	0
the screen was very bright and clear	1
a button switch	0

overall a good buy for the price	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
i find the entire process very easily mastered	1
this is the best dvd i have ever seen	1
its a fantastic very compact camera which made my experience photography much more enjoyable thanks	1
it has to and i can do it	1
this camera is awesome and i love it	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
no problems with dropped signals and it worked which only lasted a few seconds	1
now i already have a one of the best external flashes that you can buy it has a hot spot that can flash and flash	1
the brightness is not consistent with the brightness and i leave that at minimum brightness for at least rrb	1
its small and light which might not be noticeable to you except if you touch it while reading or holding it in your hand	0
the problem is that it does nt work as well as i thought	0
all the things that i have listed so far i could do without but it saves me from buying a cd to listen to on my way to the gym	1
i think of these and the other floorstandings as	1
loved it	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1

with gb of storage i have been playing around with it for about more	1
the g looks like	0
i found it pretty easy to use and it works for the audigy too	1
do not buy this player	0
it is not	0
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
the ability to completely tune and programmed for preset fm stations was also available http www fm org programming fm programming html	1
my house is small so it is easy to see the inside of the house through walls of walls but in my house the product is in the	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
its camera is stunning and the results are better than any other camera i have ever seen	1
the features are different and their is a there are a lot of features i have	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
i hope this does everything i had hoped for thanks	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
this is an excellent player for the price with features that are unique and worth the investment	1
you can see this is what you will see when i am writing this on facebook	1
proven in terms of built quality and lens	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
the sound is good but not anything like a surround system and there is reflection but i only notice it when the light is off in the room do you think you own it on amazon	0
i bought these shares and sold them to someone below expectations for this price	0
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
getting access to the device is so easy	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
i think that its x optical setting is the best for of the shots that i take	1
this is just a little less than half done with it	1
just an example of getting good value in this product	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
i ve viewed it since i got it and this monitor had plenty of picture quality	1
overall the nikon is a very robust and useful tool	1
the system has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the customer support is very rude	0
the fm radio is cool	1
the team is pretty solid	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
how much power this slim design puts out	1

it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
this was an old player before the video was no longer available	0
i only have one and that is this	0
equipment is fine but that is not what you want that s that s notwhat you want	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
the demand for the nomad is infuriating and the supply with it is limited	0
please a system that enables the user to be embedded in the actual networked network desktop and be able to drag and drop	1
you can get to almost anywhere in the world with the push of a button and it has an excellent manual that can be used if you have a car that is tough to drive	1
and just to add the features above i recommend as the best it has everything	1
but if you are looking for my version of the game i have it	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
the product company and customer support	1
the only minor nits i have with it are it is slow it is a bit of a mess and it is split between two	0
the problem is that it comes with a price tag and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it may	1
player has a problem with the game is such as and	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
it is and it is not	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
the best way is to use it is just to read up on it	1
there are no cameras in this video camera	0
how is comparing data storage with storage	0
it was easy to unbox and unpack again	0
does not work at all times without being connected and it is library	0
it does nt stop you spending the amount of cash you have that has gone bit down of course	0
it surpasses million in a single camera	1
no fm or voice recording these would not work	0
the thing is that i am not watching on an hdtv	0
there is no speaker grill to give the audio to the driver	0
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
i m not going to waste money on something i have over paid for	1
i woke up this morning with no problems	1
i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
i would recommend it to anyone	1
you can blame the bad chat support or something for that because i dont know what i did	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
the battery was dead and has been dead for the up to few years i have had it	0
over for the price this is a good unit	1
i used this monitor for years and now it is out of date and outdated	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
fixed it but why do this	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
i was hoping that it would be different but there is no difference in quality with the others	1
sound is very clear and the	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded and travel size camera i finally came to this little gem because of the quality of the lens	1
the website has links which will tell you if there are any	1
the steering wheel is easy to use and works great for me but i have noticed that the wheel is heavy	1
i have tried several times to contact apex through their on line support site and their email address but they are nt answering my calls and messages	0
this is a must to have for your family	1
with this mp player you get music for less than an hour	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
and yes this is the best phone you can have	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
the sound is great and i use it in my car with freeway noise	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
i have a contract with them and am hoping that in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the plan for now	0
the screen goes up and down in brightness which is nice but there is a step down from the brightness that comes with it at most settings	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
simply the canon that is out there today is	1
it is a dvd player also it is a dvd player	0
i did it when i was growing up and will not do it now	0
the screen is small and the blue light is bright enough to see but not so it does not blind you when you are too close	1
however the creative software is not yet available	0
this is good news i recommend this or a good backup for those things you have to have	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
the crashes frequently screwed my computer up does nt agree with me this is another thing to add and the list goes on and on	0
i have been using these songs for years and the quality of use is excellent	1
it does seem to work and should be used lots of times for this	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
thanks for the excellent photos	1
the canon is not for beginners but still has an ease of use that makes it very easy for the novice to understand	1
the world is not static and constantly changing	1
there was also a lip sync competition	0
navigation is the zen that uses i tools that are used to organize your songs	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
the quality is excellent	1
you can only buy the zen you need buying the zen is not a choice	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
not all features work perfectly	0
i do not mean to be a sensationalist but it is true	1
i e i can t understand why the government does not know the when it is the in question	0
results showed that the speeds were comparable to those of my home network when using my home broadband connection he said	1
click the scroll button to expand	1
there are plenty of metering options as well	1
it is worse than that but that is ok because all i have is to do	0
it was good easy to read	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
i highly recommend this app to anyone looking for something that it does take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i have it for a while now and it has been	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
i have this tattoo for a while now and i love it	1
i chose this song because it was the theme song for the show	1
however you do get what you ask for in life	1
this software is free to rip catalog files if you are buying from amazon but i used musicmatch to rip it before i bought the software thanks	0
the functionality on this camera is very limited	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
it was great and we just loved it	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
transfering is easy the software makes it easy	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
but when we got to the house there was nothing but no one	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
megapixels is very low and the photo quality is	0
hes not the most exciting player and does nt support the team hes the worst a tad selfish	0
the light comes out only if your hands are for a moment during the entire duration of the a	1
the eax eq did nt do anything and the custom eq did	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
but i was able to overlook those things as this car is sleek and has a great interior thanks	1
i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is interested	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
for the rest of this article i will not ask for more	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
if it had a name but no name at all	1
delivery was delayed	0
i d tell you myself but the kids want to go back to the store so i dont know how far i can go to explain this	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
and even at you can spend a ton of money on this thing	1
oh yeah i thought you ll use a new very expensive car but i went the other way and got this instead	0
the weather unit had a problem too the little switch on the screen was not working so it was hard to tell among the forecasts in my area	0
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
there is nothing so it sits next to the door	0
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
i am extremely happy with this router	1
the flash photos were good and there was still time enjoy	1
no one sells a full sized one or what ever stupid thing it is rrb is	0
i do not know how that happened but i just hooked my camera up to it a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
you can add playlists or drop songs and playlists to your playlist and play directly them to your player	1
works super easy	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon from the rrb and with no extra shipping costs it was at me in the mail by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i do not always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows me to be creative	1
i love the sound of it	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
the player has its own button when i press it on top of the screen which i have to press again which is not to my liking	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
i woke up this morning with no problems	1
now when i get home i have to sleep and it sucks the whole day	0
seriously i love it	1
when i was with them and the others were just moving the photos around	0
for the most part this is a list of	0
what a sweet machine	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
another point of note the quality of life is	1
i would recommend to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is a waiting period	1
range was similar to or possibly better than the previous router i had used	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
this is the future and what a future it is	1
it and its contents can fill a small house for sure i would recommend to a friend	1
i ve had it for less than a month and it quite well never left and the pain is all gone	0
loved the slim design	1
i know but more than a year is not enough of time for me to work	0
the auto exposure and exposure control gives you the freedom to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure can be overwhelming if you do not know how to play with the settings	0
as a final note i would like that these games have the same sound quality as those on youtube and are also can be played offline thanks	1
i am very happy with its design and quality	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
i think all of the points are well placed and valid	1
a picture taken will always have a story in it you know	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
it is a great song with lot of melody and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the volume	0
they are clears and ready to be released	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
this phone is	0
we got one for the t mobile phone and two for the ipad and one for ipad after less than two weeks of use	0
price pros star reviews cons price hard to beat at this price point	0
i picked it up for my mom for christmas but that was enough for me to be happy with it i have only used it for about	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
the only drawback is the fact that the material is very thin	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
the screen brightness is very high the screen is very sharp clear	1
the fact that this cd would play slideshows was great for me and i hope that it will play mpeg files on a cd r or a vcd too	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
i e i have not had any problems with vb and vbr mp cds	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
the video is great and it is really great to see this kind of thing is or tapes	1
these things are great for you	1
this is a long post but if you read you should be able to understand enjoy	1
the results were both good	1
i love this monitor	1
this is my first mp player and it is awesome	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
this would work perfectly for my office	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
the message from the sub to the control station is clear he said the challenge for me is that the message is clear	1
the reason i am not happy with this is the fact that it will pop up at random times	0
both units are equipped with	1
the new lcd app is great	1
they have a number of children that all have autism	0
sound quality may be off	0
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
what it does perfectly	1
i am putting my cd collection into order this gives an idea of whats good for me in the world of music	1
the grain was good	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
the only thing i do know for sure is the internet does suck	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
you have to go there and adjust it there	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
my only complaint about the hardware is	0
i tried navigating to the internet and it just would nt work	0
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
there are many options for any camera in this price range however the picture quality and features which are too good to ignore	1
the sound is excellent as one would expect from this brand	1
i like the size and weight of	1
i try to avoid horns but i do it	1
i lost my hard drive and i have not found it	0
this is a great idea but i want to let you know that if he is in an iskin you can not contact him	1
this is a bit of a pain	0
before i went for the xtra sorry for that i know but i on this and now that i have it i and i think it is the best	1
after i had it rebooted it went into hibernation where it could never find me no matter i rebooted my pc and the device etc etc etc this is what was happening	0
now that i own it though i can t imagine not being able to use it	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
it would have been better if it had a name so you know the name and if the person did it	0
it can be in the palm of your hand and it works	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
for example i made a dvd player using the r and d and it plays the dvds	1
the keypad is a nice touch but the switch on off button is small and difficult to use	0
but this is not included in the original album nor the cd version	0
i found this to be a great feature	1
so besides the above this is the list for the year i wrote	0
i tried this set it up and it did not connect	0
this machine is a replacement for	1
they are pretty comfortable to sit in and use and deliver a decent audio quality	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
both of which would repeatedly pause while the camera focused on the player below	0
in summary i hope and pray whole heartedly for this to be a high quality camera and shoot well in future	1
people may have concerns about the children not having a voice but that is not really relevant to me personally and	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i found it and will be sending it thanks at am i right	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
despite this minor issue i would recommend the book to anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
this is an incomplete list	0
the battery life is amazing	1
i bought this monitor last year and i have been very happy with it	1
i am very happy	1
have had the opportunity to try and love it	1
my prayer was answered	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
the results were as the movie was intended	0
it takes up to seconds to get online and i have to reboot it which does not sound bad until you reboot times in one hour lrb that is about as good as it gets sometimes it crashes for hours without rebooting rrb	1
i am going to carry it close to me in places where people are not looking	1
navigation is great and i found that the link to the app was great too	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
sound level will be x color tone can be adjusted for personal preference	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
the mp g is perhaps the best mp camera on the market	1
i like the product because of its potential for very high quality clean up	1
this is an ideal purchase	1
it is a fun little gadget do not expect it to be sound	0
but i do have to wear it on my belt because the belt is heavy and the case heavy thanks	0
great sound very fast very fast recharges rate small battery storage size small screen firmware updates and more	1
mr trump is very popular too	1
i do not see myself having children in the future but if i do i will take that with me it will be taken care of for me and i and with it but the change in this to me was faster than i	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
full spectrum power surges to great highs	1
it was very small and very light it was small to me and very	0
mediasource is an internet service provider	0
all pictures and white balance	1
you can adjust the amount to make sure that it does not make too much of a difference	1
in any folder i have an ability to navigate by artist album album album i also have an	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
you can create playlists drag and drop to your playlist and listen directly to your playlists	1
because this camera is beautiful	1
i love this player and am extremely proud	1
be patient and click that dreaded apply button yes or no and be prepared to wait forever every time you get one of these	0
my pictures were taken with the help of the pictures i took	0
of course i was shocked at the price but i have been extremely happy since buying it and bought as a christmas present for myself	1
considering the price and specs this could be the best deal out there for a high end mp player	1
its features work much more smoothly and smoothly than those of other models i have	1
they caused a huge product failure because the tech failed to believe what the software said	0
it has been and is	1
mr trump is very rude	0
seems like a good product	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
i keep navigating and there is no in menu and it still works	1
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
i have one and i am very happy with it	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
its faster than my previous acer one too he said great	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
the software on this is very good	1
i love you and i am very proud	1

i was out of breath for hours and having just dropped the bones i was exhausted thanks to	0
changing it is done with four presets and then i set that at minimum for at least rrb	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
it was so i ended up laying it down	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
i have three batteries to charge myself with the s but not in the s	0
and it has quite a bit of a heft after the stainless steel heft factor	1
it would work but it would not go through the internet signal from the cable modem it would not work	0

i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
a ban on autofocussing comes with a catch which can t be stopped	0
i have been working on it for the past few weeks and the result of it is wonderful	1
the changing colors and how to tell them	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i wanted to see if it worked and it did	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
the link on the page does not work properly	0
my fiance ordered this because she is a virgin so she needed something that would protect her from anyone messing with her	1
i am looking forward to having lots of music played on this baby as well as a few more of them in the data folder	1

i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
for a specific reason i dont think its a mobile phone	0
the i already has a one of the most external sources that money can buy now the g has a hot shoe that can buy an i and vice versa	0
the polyphonic ringtone is a common one as are the polyplonic ringtones	1
i give it a couple of stars	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
it has all sorts of benefits	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
for the rest of this article i recommend	1
what is good in design detracts in build quality as well is obvious	0
minimal lag between songs better than that on other devices good value for a portable player	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
the size is small	1
if nt one of them you have to get the link cable to get it its full of stink and you know it	0
it is dangerous and sometimes that danger is just trying to put out fires	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
this is too much for me i need to get done with some music that is lrb and this is relative for a lrb but once you crank the volume up to a rrb a	0
it is possible for it to happen but has not that it will happen so it is unlikely to happen	0
how to avoid this model of the plague	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
n wo nt you can download directly from the website using the included transfer cable	0
before i went for it i didnt but now and now that i have it i love it and i m sure it is the best out there	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1

and so off i went to work and i did what i did it for admirably	1
this product is good enough to make you happy	1
even more	1
not only is it beautiful and beautiful but it is also	1
i recognized my other students easily and further communication was a breeze with them	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
the hot air balloon allowed me to buy and use a new car	1
audio then video output failed	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
there is no way this lasts forever	0
you know nt that upgrade is possible	1
it will download and play all cd files	1
it has a range much longer than what it needs	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
i found a free third party driver that is compatible it does not work on my laptop however i was able to install it	0
there is an alarm i set but it doesnt work	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i thought it was funny but then i started reading the discs to see that it is not my fault	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
focusing on a display screen in a room where pictures taken by this camera were displayed and in a number of rooms	0
he was right when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of shoes he was right	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
the game did a good job converting the image to fill of the screen and it still works	1
it is and has a lot to it	1
this is by far the finest book in its genre and it i	1
how this product was created and was left behind	0
i recently moved and am unemployed	0
my wife is much more impressed with it due to its widescreen	1
i m not usually bothered by electronics tending to be expensive but this product is	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
this was the case for the first and a half years and then the color disappeared	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
i fell in love with this camera it filled me with an immense joy	1
the larger screen has allowed me to see all my files in one place on the dell rrb and edit them	1
these speakers are great	1
the colors and everything are great	1
it is small so it easily fits in pockets	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
there are many options in this very powerful camera	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
i can t see it now only because when it happens it is gone	0
i would venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best stereo system out there	1
my only conclusion to this is that it happened once and i am not sure why do not know if it was an accident or if it been a mistake	0
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
this led to there is no	0
the book is free so you can download it if you want	1
what i include here is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day about anything enjoy	1
it will just spin up and stop and start again	0
it allows the information on the page to be used either for or	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
on the other hand of course is pretty good once you have it	1
it has a lot of features that compensate for the extraneous noise of being in a car or on a train they are very cool as well as functional	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
its only able to select songs and has no ability to use on the playlist itself not to mention it does not sinc with your phone ect ect	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
p o box finds a new problem days after purchase	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs	1
i was a bit disappointed though	0
while they have decent speakers the volume on such devices is lower than with smartphones making it difficult to use	0
it has never worked	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
if it has a cool screen why not use it	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
the hard drive i had attached to the computer was sometimes accessible and sometimes not	0
the link to this page is broken and just about does nt load on some computers	0
yes it is expensive but not as expensive as it sounds	1
i have had no luck	0
even the slightest change totally distorts reality	0
solid state cooling to better heat dissipation	0
when you do it it is worth every penny	1
x zoom is nice	1
however when i am in an office i listen to them at a pretty low volume and so they are a little louder	0
thanks to amazon is my return address i was able to get at least on my part	1
these monitors are great for the price	1
i think this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur needs he said its awesome	1
i have had this book for years and have been wanting to read it it is after the date and date of the book to read	1
i took my car in to acer for repairs for such a thing but got none of that from them	0
when you have this in your life you know it is there it is real and it so true	1
full capacity	1
second gripe in that we purchased two of of these and have not been returned yet	0
only one thing about the app you can only use the app once when you are on the phone not while it is	0
it is designed for video but has limitations that it will not so it is an excellent camera to watch	1
they are not and never to be trusted	0
i could play all my games and now the games can t play i have a problem because the	0
door broke after a month	0
we all know they are not perfect they will work if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to that	0
ripping the songs off is very very quick and the music is very good	1
a question which was never answered by very high tech	0
i did not install on my personal notebook	0
very long lasting battery life	1
i love all of the pictures	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the speakers are very good and with the bass boost the sound is exceedingly good	1
but this is not to be confused with nor the cd version	1
the possibilities with this and the new scene mode which offers optimized situational lighting portrait landscape and snow scenes are endless	1
a great quality in a tiny package a tiny package with huge potential	1
progressive sports player for a reasonable price	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
nothing but good with this one	1
i think the finish is more mirror like and i like it	1
very easy to set up	1
the screen is dark and the lights are off	0
it is hard to say for sure but it has a lot of potential for me to get into	1
i think that it is a fantastic idea	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
the list is large and easy to read	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
the best ipod for the price the value gb price	1
i think i would invest in some cool ones if it has them thanks	1
i did not lose any of my region one dvds and they were not damaged in any way thanks to the player above	1
due to poor quality no doubt rrb and others are trying to get rid of these random routers nothing more than what is currently on this router at present	0
this is too much for normal people	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
the buttons on this are small even for me but you get used to them very quickly	1
it also has a	1
this is an excellent player for the price with features that are similar to and better than the others	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
all in all good	1
it does nt have to most people do nt generally have them themselves	1
i have now had it for months and i am more comfortable with it	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
i had to return them the day i got them so i was forced to pay them	0
the auto mode that saves the battery at the same time will come in handy when i need it	1
i dont mind having an external antenna but it costs money and the speed on it is slow	0
ripping the cable with my usb connection is a very bad idea and it is very expensive	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
people were uncomfortable	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
the fact that the top of the door kept sliding off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i have had no idea what so ever with this blog	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
i think this is a good dvd player	1
i find the lack of transparency on this quite disturbing	0
when you turned it on and listened to it as you did it when you were turning it off	1
i m keeping this player cautious	0
unfortunately after all these songs all i get now is that im not rich or busy	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
no one speaks to the camera	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
the system is terrific in size and design and worth looking into	1
i was a bit surprised that it was nt more helpful	0
im not going to dwell on it it is not the best but it is certainly there and needs to be addressed	0
nokia and t mobile are going to line up well on this baby	1
great product works great for my house	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
but after days the sound faded but not the memory	0
but this camera is	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
when i took outdoor photos i and the kids were in the photos too	0
unfortunately after loading this all i got is this	0
and with the right tools is incredibly easy	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
this is one of the best in its price and category i have ever seen	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
i would strongly recommend this book	1
these are great places for the kids to play in the park	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it is beautiful and has a good atmosphere	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the earbuds that apple made are not that bad	1
i thought i was going to see what it was when i opened the box but its being held i guess	1
but as with all things in life in small doses you get used to being lost	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
for the time being and if you can t find the	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
the replacement was faulty too the little switch was not working properly making it impossible to enter the city centre	0
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
if you want to know that you can you will know	1
sturdy and compact	1
i am happy and the day was very good	1
i am very bored with my blog so here is a rant	0
it needs the usb port on it to be able for nas or print out	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
it was easy to set up and my ps and ps and ps all worked without issue	1
upon opening these i found them to be really nice but having a hard time understanding them	0
the colors and the textures are not imposing and blend seamlessly into the rest of my life enjoy	1
it looks good and does what it says	1
proven canon errors	0
i tried calling the phone number for her several times a day and got a busy signal	0
this apex court will not agree with it	0
with it enabled we were able to connect we had to manually turn on the power of the router because	0
i t	0
i hate it for ripping off which it does a lot of	0
i found a mediasource to upload your songs to and to be uploaded	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
he has been a steady performer all year editing by andrew hay	1
my only hope is that it comes from me and it is good when it does because it helps	1
i think this is bang for the buck thanks to you	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
as i said the new mediasource software is more robust than what i have said though it could still work better	1
it is the only media i have tested so far even an app that i downloaded and the rental dvd that can nt be played on it	1
if they stink and you dont like them you have to pay the extra cable to get additional games	0
best tech support i have ever had	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
it may	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
what really made this a great player for me was this	1
i use batteries to charge myself and with the s but it in itself is a battery powerhouse	1
the software on the computer	0
but with a higher price and lower quality	0
it is more powerful than its predecessor and packed with even more features	1
halfway through the first day the router page not found screen replaced most of the router is gone	0
my stress level is ok	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
i found downloading and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the system is very well integrated with the one which you have	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
you can manage your profile from the comfort of home make any type of changes	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
the impact on this country is mind blowing	1
i m giving this a try	1
it worked out and we just had fun	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
i ve had a wonderful day and i m very happy	1
plusses are the extra battery and the camera	1
the keyboard is very nice and very comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
the server was down but upon enabling the guest network things started working	0
after watching it for just a few minutes i could not find any dvd	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
the pictures taken indoor were nt so clear	0
i was waiting for it and then it happened	1
it does not only have difficulty with it it even has trouble with it	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
this camera really has something to it	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
hooked up to the d link and the speed dropped to mbps and i	0
just an average user and a good value in my opinion	1
the screen is bright and easy to read and by no means a major advantage over the battery life is good the unit is	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
download from t mobile is free too	0
for the price it is worth	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
fragile	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
the build quality is excellent	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
it is a great product and well worth the price	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media in the rw and dvd stores	1
i am not to agree with you but the world is very important to me and growing up	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
it also does not have a	0
nice little phone light compact	1
the other two are all dead	0
the camera is somewhat small and has an awkward tiny lens that sticks out so that you have to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i dont know what gets i have it in my head that should tell you if i am right the answer is yes	0
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
the fact that all of this is easy to set up and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and support but by last but not least it is free mp file size with	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
they will not be happy and the office is constantly busy	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
now for the things you should know starting with the screen is really big and in size is perfect for in screen transfer they are easy to use after a while and i have many more a ton of things going on here	1
her work is phenomenal	1
the system has failed repeatedly	0
died very soon after meeting them	0
even though your services are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
a week out of the box and i am starting to feel slight contractions coming from time to time growing more frequent	0
it did seem to have worked for some time	0
it is quite a bit bigger than that but that is ok because all i need is room to breathe	0
i ve sent e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
this is easy to do	1
i have a built in wall rated speaker wire and the speaker can accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the wall	1
the battery is nice	1
first of all there is no ipod second is not to the ipod	0
this router is	0
this is my life and what a life it is	1
i have had it for about weeks and it is not what i expected	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
paid for amazon is a good option at lrb price depression due to low quality no doubt rrb and amazon to get a good quality product these days thats it for me	1
the iphone plus has a wonderful set of features	1
customer service and customer support to tell you about the quality of their products and their willingness to help	1
one other plus is that it now supports the following	1
i just got back and i think this is the best i have had	1
the more i read the more i love it	1
very happy with the monitor and the results	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the phone i was using had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be disconnected	0
what worries me is the fact that it does not apply to me	0
its not as high as i thought it is not	0
i am enjoying my life a lot	1
i like the idea but it is not very flashy	0
it may	1
it may	1
that itself does nt weight on its own and i understand but i wish i put it down to me when i read just to listen to and understand	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
markets are not even in macro	0
check out this list of superior pieces of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
it does not have an autofocus system which is good for shooting in low light it allows the camera to focus in low traffic	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox concept is that it is the	0
the device itself is pretty solid	1
good range of	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
i did and now it is a mixture of love and hate	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
i would recommend this book to anyone	1
i want to be able to return it and it took to get through it	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
also this is a new player unlike my previous player	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
so if you re reading this you should be very happy with it	1
this one does drop off but not like this	0
the player has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are to get to them by hand it takes up the entire screen and screen	0
these are the results for the campaign in the election	0
the next one will probably have some meat in it you can t deny that	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
the person on the other end of the call can help you out thanks	1
so that it is not used for the promotion of any product or service	0
this is not ready for prime time something is wrong with the firmware and or the hardware that makes this possible	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
the app is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily done thanks	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
all in all very easy to do	1
awesome sound system	1
it looks great and is packed with features	1
these speakers are	1
simple to use buttons and display are very easy to set up and use	1
reading the cds was time consuming but i think it would have been just as fun enjoy	1
i want mediasource to allow your songs to be uploaded easier and faster	1
the problem is that it starts with me and that it is not enough	0
thanks for reading and having just dropped the ball for me i guess back to the grind of life	1
bought it and so far it has worked	1
all in all this is great	1
the screen is bright enough to see in the dark	1
i think it is the best digital camera ever and i love it	1
i have had the computer lock up several times	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
the camera is a dream to use in automode but there is flexibility in aperture priority and shutter speed	1
i will have all the whistles and whistles this machine is missing	1
keep your fingers on the keys	1
only think about how you can only hear once the phone you are holding rings not while it is ringing	0
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
great picture	1
the environmental audio however is great and has made most of my songs better than before it	1
the world is a better place than most of the countries out there	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
it seems that if the router gets hacked	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
it is very well built and has a	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
it is not and it does not have the name	0
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
you have to go there and adjust it there	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
the player is mechanics are good but flawed	0
i have had this thing just over a month and it has been great	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
i think i think the satellites look ugly	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
i found this to be a great feature	1
it is easy to use and easy to understand	1
perhaps the biggest advantage this man has is the fact that the woman can kill him herself by opening the lid and throwing him in the water	1
this place is trash	0
the sound quality was atrocious and it simply did nt work at all	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
ipod is better and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
portable	1
while i had the positive experience and an excellent headset and earpiece	1
i can t see why not they are the sound people for computers	0
it does not work that way it does	0
the switch negotiated the speed of the switch and connected it with a gige link	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
very easy to use	1
i was and would not be	0
the music that came from that cheap cassette player sounded like carnegie hall	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
