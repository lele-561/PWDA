the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1

i this would think i m find and quality nt ease of use for under i thrilled with my purchase did	1
a little phone thats compact	1

the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
it has few and very few visitors	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
the build quality feels good it does nt look or feel cheap and the build and finish is top notch	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0

the benefits of the slim design	1
this is an excellent value	1
sometimes the phone would ring so i would have to wait then get up	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the price performance	1
this is so lame	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
the problem with this is that it happens as often if not more frequently	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
all the latest acer stuff	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
i just the player find was thought then but i to checking started the discs is actually ruining my media that the apex it	0

satisfied i played around the equalizer at of the am i with and range settings choices ve have there too	1
but this camera is great	1
the  controls are want to instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i buttons hold the thin  on the side back of the phone thin is on the back where you can see the buttons are want to instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i buttons hold the thin on the side back of the phone which i thi instead of on the front which i thin on the side back of the phone instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i buttons hold the thing the thin is on the back where you can see the buttons are want t like because that is where  my thumb is when i buttons hold the thing	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0

this product is too fragile for normal use	0
the pictures come out hazy if you look even for a second during the entire process of taking them	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
the interface was atrocious and i simply did nt like it	1
the speakers excellent sound i the speakers found very well even the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
the results were as the author intended	1
this product is definitely definitely worth the purchase	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0

i find it interesting too bright	1
a picture taken will always have a story in it you know	1
the keys layout close together and is not too weird is it the bit funky in to relation standard rectangular layout keypads but a are	0
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
the final insult is download while have router comes trial useful software to make it is you a unlock all the features snap printers only a with sharing version this to that from the internet wirelessly then pay an additional the trial software to some unknown company to	1

over the network storage is slow only use does too much	0
i so far had no problems all and m very happy at i ve	1
i bought all it did was this set it up and all would not connect at tried to get it to work but wireless n speeds	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
are the picturers amazing	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
for me like me but a good it has plenty of features for me to grow int it is easy enough to simple to use use for a beginner enough set up and easy like me but a good it has plenty of features for me like me it is not to grow into	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
it difficulty playing jpegs not only have it has even does trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
the screen is large and easily read	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
i hate widescreen movies	0
multiple play modes but in is the zen xtra tracks shuffle that order standard in this matter all jukebox players album worth noting etc deficient of not is on	0
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
it is small overall bigger than mind that but this the ipod less expensive keep zx because different in but not necessarily in technology is used inferior the is	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
easy enough but it to do did not work work	0
the software sucks	0
it approximately to seconds to come lrb i have timed it rrb which sound that bad get nailed times in one hour lrb is bad as it for hours without rebooting rrb	0
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
it works and looks great if you can get it right	1
it is small	1
the very good picture is clear bright and sharp and sound quality is good the the sound is the colours are good good	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
same story as everybody else trying to get service from apex nothing	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on hand was very helpfu was very helpful the buffalo the technical support phone line the techsupport phone linethe technical suppor the other hand the buffalo the buffalo on the on the one hand was very helpfu was very helpfu the other hand the technical support line on the other hand was very helpfu was very helpful	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
now that i have all my music back there has never been a better time	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
however you do get what you it pay pay it you will get for in reliable products	1
a great system is	1
the poor design continues with the case	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the door would not close	0
data files not allow folder structure nor does it allow documents be opened programs	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
the sound quality	1
is but also a bit bigger than expected is is it ok because i need that to something with work all my iphone	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
winamp of sound options has like an lots equalizer almost with the options	0
my dwl ap does this product not to get it to work work this product as no way for me a repeater for for me as there it di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1

whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
third the poor design continues with the case	0
this is the best phone i have seen	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
what a junk	0
i had no idea i already had to load movies and albums onto this unit	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the sound of it from the player is ok	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
these are some of the people who received a car that came in perfect working condition	0
phone	0
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
this is not reliable and should be dropped	0
i do not think that it matters though i opened my eyes up a little while ago and it was gone	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
i called they me new firmware but not solve the problem	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
living in small college the e s and e s were what i	1
seems like it a good product	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
this is a joke i think it is funny and you should listen to it rather than have no fun	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
not a bad for what it is designed monitor very good not the best for but it is nothing special	1
m equalizer settings much more frustrated but very games now with that i have acceptable open and card i i to i up my music is know control panel every time switch have between saved and videos or some of the properties the sound is still sound	0
bothered i been highlights on the s by out ve blown and the g to seems do only slightly better	0
mp is about right for the market of this camera	1
a large area however if is not a requirement a small area and the speed the ability reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router this router is not for everyone suit you will do the job	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the buttons on the phone but you to them rather quickly	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
that disappointed me is the what not it seem does fact to read certain dvds	0

in with it fact to make it work each of my creative mp players had software problem that in the first place	0
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0

both are intuitive enough for	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0

what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
other than that the listen to sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this the music was great was great all over again	1
picture quality is excellent	1
also the cap design	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1

i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
so far the router has worked well	1
this means that there is a high chance that this phone will not work	0

the router pretty good	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
