very easy to set up	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
i get to sleep and the world freezes	0
no one has mentioned about this	0
this is my life and what a life it is	1

it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
but it never fails to amaze	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1

it can pop off easily but i dont have any holes in it so i did it after first day	0

in addition it comes with a dvd and cd	1
it is not	0
itunes uses i tag tags that are embedded in the mp files to identify your songs you can find the tags here	0

image camera	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
i have no idea but the house on saturday is especially quiet	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1

months ago and it no longer exists	0
it did not do enough for me and the custom eq was a waste of money he said thanks	0
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
this book is definitely worth the purchase	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
this has been hard for me and at this point you can t help me sorry	0
after we found the problems we tried to contact apex but we cannot communicate with them the only telephone number we have and they do not answer their phones	0

this app has many other features too just to name one that i like	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
the difference is much larger	1
i am ncercat	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
i d tell you myself my story but the i had to go back to the store so i wasnt enough to tell	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1

it was worth it because ag neovo is what it has become	1

the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
these are easily installed with rd party earphones and software	0

the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0

there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1

definitely more scared of sharing the room with you than any other person i know	0
poor visibility on the keys	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1

the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
not plug play relies on i d no fm or recording	0
i wont go into the details here as im not into that in depth but i am very impressed with the features the camera has the quality the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1

all other buttons are easy to use easy to touch and work well	1
you may be zen but there is not anything the zen mind can t do once you start it	0
the results are much inferior to the original	0
considering the price and specs this could be the best out there for you	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
huge amount of space i have my own collection which is not that much and i have gb out	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0

seriously i love it	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
speakerphone and has some nice extra features such as an fm converter and a stopwatch	1
thank you to the staff i have come to be so familiar with over the past month of working with them and their excellent service and support	1
your browser does not lets you review the files before it begins its replication learn more	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
while there are others the situation gets worse because of it	1
is nice	1

definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
it also has a very nice interface and a somewhat useful application which is	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
overall i like it	1
while going for it i was tempted to buy it only as it is cheap	0
i highly recommend getting the headset and the wifi bluetooth headphones enjoy	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
the battery unit had problems too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to charge the battery	0
it is the only way out of the dvd is without problems of being afflicted with	1
the dog is always either outside or in a basement four hours a day all the time	0

now i already have a one of the best external flashes that you can buy it has a hot spot that can flash and flash	1
you re going to have to buy more the more you suck	0
we can and when we get to chapter the frames start to change	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
the future is good	1
if you are not sure about this	0
im not going to dwell on it it is not the best but it is certainly there and needs to be addressed	0
do you buy this product	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
just bought it and already love the features it has	1
great price tag	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
it is light enough to read at night but dark enough so it does not blind you when you are too tired it is blue and the blue is	1
no matter the format	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
usb network is good but it is slow	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the customer support team	1
for the most part this is a list of	0
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
so get back to work and thanks to all your friends who did of course for a team that can t do what can and for a lot of the others	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
the world is small	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
the sound quality is really good	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad isnt working any suggestions	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
this was a shipping service	1
this is one of the nicest phones ive ever used	1
i like bright colors and light weight i think it works like a charm too	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
you are standing there thinking you are doing something good and you are but then it stops and you are alone	1
is nice	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
both players tried to freeze the ball while the counter on the player kept going	0
i have never experienced	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
now when the weather changes i have to change and it sucks	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
one other issue is that the jack is attached to the wall so it will not work	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
the wireless earbuds are useless so just use headphones instead	1
when i put it to use there is graduation party in the morning and it worked great even out of doors	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
this little guy has it	1
i was surprised how good it was and i plan to use it when i am done	1
it has never worked	0
the service from the supplier to the customer	1
as a very technical person i was happy to have the free valet plus the hotspot service	1
with my sennheiser it is loud and at	1
well this is a dvd player too	0
while i like the performance of the game i would buy it upon release	1
no changes to the format	0
does what it should and thats what matters to me	1
and it works too	1
the resolution is x and the colors are	1
it may	1
my output stopped workin	0
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
all the best acer is top notch	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
what really made this work for me was the following	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
i think it is color better but it is not perfect	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
this is a must to have for your family	1
i like the name because it is not for the reason that it is and it is to show it off on me	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
however nothing on this particular router worked properly	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
i tried and i found that the transmission from the player to the server was bad too i e too	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
and i love it and as such i will leave you with a sweet jbl sub	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the bottom line is for the most part these things happen and have consequences	0
i am using them in my life and they work	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
the dvd version is available	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
great price for all the features	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
not only is it beautiful and beautiful but it is also	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
i think i like it	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
i am happy and the day was very good	1
i love you	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0

even works better on g band than the linksys	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
the site was easy to set up and has worked well for the up to few years i have used it	1
it can be out on the patio or on the deck	1
not plug play back on i have no idea or anything	0

in fact if you are just someone that is a fan of myspace and you just want to do some networking and chat and browse myspace all day this is great for you	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
the switch the one which switches everything feels fragile	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this plan because of the combination of great priced plan and quality	1
whether you are on a hike waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you will be glad you had the opportunity enjoy	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
i love these speakers and would buy them to be well below par for this price	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
the system is terrific and is looking better than the ipods	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
it has all the features you need	1
you can thank me or the universe for that because i have all the money i need	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
it makes up for this by being easy to use with out anything that can be hacked	1
im just fine with it at this point it is frustrating and frustrating but i was able to figure out most of it	1
very long lasting battery life	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1

when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the netbook with the increased memory option was the one with the windows home screen otherwise other netbooks with windows were available and nobody complained	1
they are pretty easy to put in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
it is an object which costs to replace	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
even leaving it on the table produces crystal dust	0
the remote is here	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
this is for the benefit of those that are not able to be in a regular setting	1
it has a full hd screen	1
the system and controls are as follows	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
very very long battery life very fast recharges with removable battery pack great firmware updates and great price	1
overall i lira	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
its as everybody knows when you try to get service from apex nothing	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
that is pretty impressive from him rappler com	1
it is used and used	1
you can see this is the best you will find on lrb i am posting this on rrb	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
to them you have to listen to them they stink and you ca	0
the phone is sound quality is good i do not have any complaints about this phone and everything that i hear from my is friends is great	1
i did not have a clue about how to do it it was just fun	0
when it dies its gone but i have gone through it now both with and without	0
i like the fact i can do it in my bed or in and out	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
these are perfect for you	1
and i think there is no doubt about that	1
when you are on vacation and return to it as you left it when you were gone	1
we own all of them and i am very happy with the quality of the these products especially at the price these are for sale	1
i love ht speakers but this speaker does the same thing for my low end	0
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
as a whole the system works well and works fine	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
on this is only once you have it configured	0
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
overall a sweet experience	1
worked fine	1
the size is small	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
you can be up to about people and it will work	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
also the following design is available	1
this is the best way i know	1
i immediately had trouble getting the phone to work	0
i indicated i should use the rom but it turns out it only works and offered only by apple on ios for apple computers	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
the plan is okayed	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
what i do know is that at lower volume i can	0
the future but you can never expect much out of the world you live in the now	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
all in all a great album that the i could do away with and one that is easy to understand and use and a great sound	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
minimal lag between songs better than that on other devices good value for a portable player	1
many of our players do not play on sundays	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
in the theory world but in enabling the world things stopped working	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
one good thing it is the end of summer	1
have tried to contact you via email but the address is not working	0
when i am in an office i can hear them at work and at home they sound a little weak	0
i was the first and it has lasted	1
this is one of many articles that have come in	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
small print	1
at the end of the game what i got was a xtra which allows me to play any song from my collection if i choose and the ixtra is free of ads and features	1
i will have to talk with others here about this	0
it was a great game and continues to be one of the best	1
it has a few problems one is that the results do not automatically change after another day on it	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
this router is phenomenal	1
key instead	0
i would strongly recommend this product	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
the other two are all dead	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
volume level is	1
it is located on the top floor rrb and very family friendly in the setup and atmosphere im all over my new story now	1
it is possible for it to happen but has not that it will happen so it is unlikely to happen	0
be prepared for a few lrb minutes delay but the wait is worth it	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
the camera is somewhat small and has an awkward tiny lens that sticks out so that you have to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
but for what i know it works	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
it sucks	0
i have three children at very good schools from whom we are extremely happy with	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
the bad news is that it comes with a hefty price tag and for most purposes it is not worth it	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the door would not close	0
the system is available but does not work nor does it allow missiles or rockets to be launched from it	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
i will not mess with my universal remote control i promise	1
i could play all my games and now the games can t play i have a problem because the	0
it did not seem to have a new name for it	0
you can see the bottom of the barrel in the view finder	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
i bought this book for my trip to china and it fits perfectly	1
these are great places for the kids to play in the park	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
the app is finicky it works most of the time but there is some new users and they have some problems it that they just return the app	0
good luck	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
as i mentioned before this is not really robust against what others have done notmad enough to work better	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
i know but less than a month is not an awfully long time for something like that	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
my first impression	1
video output stopped workin	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
the good news is that microsoft now supports this in their software	1
tech support from apex court	1
then download the files	1
the customer support is very rude	0
its very small and lightweight which is not harmful to you except if you use it while running or while it sleeps	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
the book is well written and interesting but unfortunately lacks a	0
a great deal for a relatively low price	1
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
however i was able to overlook those flaws as it looks sleek and has a great look enjoy	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it has a nice color screen	1
picture quality edit	1
there are times when i am trying to focus on what i had to do with it there are times and i do not have to think	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
the buttons for volume and power are very easy to read access and use photo reviewed	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the book is free so you can download it if you want	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
this means that there is a good chance that this one will not break the typical pattern	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the keys are close together and the keyboard is not in proportion to standard keys it is a bit weird but it is not too weird	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
i made playlists using the included software to create my own but it was not as easy as i would have liked	0
do nt buy this player	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
pictures are nt able to be transferred directly from the camera using the transfer function	0
the language is easy to understand and it is	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
im not watching on an app it is on tv although i dont	0
battery life and compatibility with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i bought it thanks	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the moveable lcd file	1
i e i have proof that this blog takes great pictures	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
sub woofer is large	1
the woofer is much larger	1
unfortunately it turned out to be	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
i have been using all of the shutter speed aperature and iso adjustments manually but all controls are automatic and and the manual is useless	0
very easy to set up	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
this is a list of books that i read	1
the dvd player is fine	1
for me its fine and good for me and it is more than acceptable	1
portable	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the problem with the video camera is that it will take you to	0
storage capacity	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
the storage capacity is	1
but really the only thing you should worry about is the fact that it does have	1
the only problem i have is that when you want to sleep you have to sleep or it hurts	0
it will help me with the disign the specs the best	1
it is up to you what it is to you re listening to	1
this is the kind of thing at that can make you almost laugh at it	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
i think it has a great great sound for its size and price i understand that the speakers and the own volume are things that should be left to the manufacturer so i do nt blame them for the fact of the speakers not being able	0
i wrote it on a napkin at pm rrb and with the help of my friend was at my house by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
for those who like the fact that this is one of the very good movies this year	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
picture quality is excellent	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
it is very easy and fun to use	1
yes it is expensive but not as expensive as the alternatives	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
i was surprised to find that in this app i could play movies which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was limited to movies which i created with it	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i agree with those who say that there is a minimum vertical angle in order to work	1
however the only thing i am not sure is the likelihood that it will show up at all	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
this play is not available	0
the problem is large	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
its like when you try something and it does nt work as it should out there	1
music videos can be viewed on youtube without aid of a computer and you can download the videos to watch for your now deleted selections or playlists	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
they are very nice and you can take the pictures when you close the subject it is very nice	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
the process is slow and the communication with the user is sub par	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
how to unbox and install	0
the i has all the features the i has and if you decide if thats your only option to go for it	1
very long lasting effects	1
the sound effect is	1
the possibilities are endless it comes with auto manual and the new scene mode which has optimized situational settings for shooting	1
there are lots of things such as this	1
overall an excellent phone	1
instead	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
it is harder than i thought but as it turns out so is the internet	0
software the software industry	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
but i do have to wear it on my belt because the belt is heavy and the case heavy thanks	0
the books are all out now so there is no need	1
seriously i love it	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
i just purchased the canon powershot g and am very happy with the purchase	1
with all of this i have about about with me for about more	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
its a bit more durable and it should last longer	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the cost of storage	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the app does most of the work but there are manual settings too it does	1
the sound quality is	1
i am not very happy with this or this	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
they do look good in the dark though	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the others allowing batteries to be charged while in the camera but not allowing you to use the camera while plugged in down the line	0
the app is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt work	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the stock is on the cheap side	0
and when i plugged it into the computer the screen went blank	0
i bought this book opened it up and was not impressed at all	0
it was from to at the time failed to	0
the router failed today and is dead now when i need to work from home now	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
it has changed my life and the world	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
it is tall so i can stand up to it easily	0
i do not but i think i am doing it	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
the zen of sound sounds great with great and well recored mp s	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
the quality is superb	1
finally i can give my thumbs down rating for at t as a carrier	0
the quality is excellent	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
the quality is top notch	1
the app is free but if you have the money you should be able to check it out	1
i did not write this on my personal notebook	0
i found it and will be sending it thanks at am i right	1
the case is that it costs me money just to listen to it in its cage	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
i have not even started my job yet and already i am	0
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
what worries me is the fact that it does not seem to work	0
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
the system recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to drag and drop songs from the disk to a cd for playback click through for details	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
bought it and so far it has worked	1
i thought it had all the features but when i tried to do a test it just disappeared sorry	0
t rexs health continues to be a major problem	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
bright vivid clean lines great design and best of all great price	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
first of all my kids were born	1
its very lightweight and portable	1
the next day i tried on it and it worked but no internet connection	0
what makes this free is that phone calls and texts are very responsive	1
we are very happy no need for a celebration congratulations on that	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
in all i hope this is helpful for the readers	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
my only complaints were longer battery life and higher price i found both	1
i shared this with you and it is exactly how it is the clarity is amazing	1
apparently i am and can t keep up with them	0
while they have decent speakers the volume on such devices is lower than with smartphones making it difficult to use	0
i spent on it so you get it and do nt have to buy rrb and i at least my macbook and macbook pro	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
i hate the name but it just did it	0
i did a lot of research and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
i did not think i would like the huge speakers they are bigger than the ipod but i have listened to them and laughed at them	1
i think the game controller stand with it is very nice and simple with buttons	1
besides i hate it	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
these speakers are	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
the only thing i am concerned about is the amount of time spent on the thing	0
other than that this thing is awesome	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
good looks	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
but it can be so easy that i thought it was when i was already out of it	1
the auto focus is good but i like having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to the scene in which i want to use the camera	0
the ringing tones are so loud it almost doubles up which is great when you are travelling its excellent	1
i do not know what they are saying but the message is clear	1
i did it when i was growing up and will not do it now	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
