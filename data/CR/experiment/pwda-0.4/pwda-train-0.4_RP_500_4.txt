its like when you try something and it does nt work as it should out there	1
there are still bugs on my computer but not as many as when i was	0
the process of processing and shipping was very fast	1
the rest of the network and gprs will only work if because they have a connection that allows you to connect to the network to be connected on a different network	0

this router does work once in a while but not like the old router did	0

without a doubt i would say that they have the same sound quality as i have and are what can be expected from a speaker i think enjoy	1
i d tell you myself but the internet is hard to reach so i never got lucky enough to try this	0
for instance i made one of my favorite movies using this and it and it works the best	1

what worries me is the fact that it does not apply to me	0
i know this is support number many times but it just works	1
this player is	1
last night i went to bed	0
you can only buy the zen you need buying the zen is not a choice	0

this will not work for me period	0
turning to the camera	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
this is for the benefit of those that are not able to be in a regular setting	1
its clear and simple that this company is just scrambling to survive period	0
i think it works and can be used in a classroom setting where you only need your child to be at home	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0

i am amazed and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this camera and can not keep up with the cameras limitations because i am not aware of its resolution limits	0
this dvd is without doubt being played by a number of people it played well	1

i love the storage in this thing	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it also has difficulty properly playing jpeg files	0

it is taking a bit longer than usual but that is ok because it is easy to use with my iphone	0
of course i was hesitant about the price but i have been extremely happy and grateful as well as for my parents	1

i d tell you myself my story but the internet refuses to listen so i never write enough to do this	0
it will play and play all day long disc	1
great speakers are	1
great camera	1
weaknesses of the app and it is so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with zoom so you have to cycle through every zoom setting before you get to them	0
it is broken so i gave up on it anyway	0
the link on the page does not work properly	0
it does this in all aspects of life	1
i wished that they could have been a little bit nicer	0
looks fantastic esp when docked	1
item that came with the set up and we have never had to set the modem at all so far since it is working so my daughter is giving me grief about losing her wireless internet connection on her computer i added a no hogging	1
it does not have an auto focus mode which is useful for shooting in low light it allows the camera to focus in low	0
but this one is great	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
the subwoofer has terrific bass and gets the job done	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the buttons and switches and such	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
i recently moved and am unemployed	0
i think this is bang for the buck thanks to you	1
i was a little bit in the low end	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
it does not only have trouble sleeping it even has trouble sleeping	0
the larger lens of the camera gives you in low light and the flash gives you just that much more	1

on all of this is pretty easy once you have everything figured out	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are beautiful	1
i am watching them in action and they are	1

i am very pleased with my zx so here is a pic	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
the pictures are very sharp indeed	1
to my ears a kbps wma sound is just as good as mp and the zen xtra sounds great too	1
so not only does it use the shutter it can also be used to zoom and pan he said	1
this is a list of applications for storage and data storage	0
not only is it fast and runs like a dream but it is also eye candy	1
there is no parking so it sits next to the road	0
this has so many capabilities that you can have as many as they need	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
these are also very important at least for me	1
the size is unknown	1
screen brightness is	1
i i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do think i have to say	0
you can also drag and drop songs and playlists to and from directly from to your player	1
have you ever tried to send an e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
whether you were taking your dog for a walk or just having lunch you would be glad you had the fm radio	0

the last time i had it was sometimes and sometimes not	0
this small speaker system puts out great sound with most mp players	1
update the system has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the software is very easy to use and once i got of my box i was hooked to it	1
the subwoofer is really loud and really high	1
my two main concerns were the battery life and how i found both	1
the best thing about this monitor is the stand	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
price	1
the zooming lever is shaky i think it does not work mechanically as you would expect	0
i do not know what other people think but i	0
my house is small so it is easy to see the inside of the house through walls of walls but in my house the product is in the	1
instead	0
its fine	1
i find it too bright	0
good luck	1

i think the satellites are	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
there is nothing which has been said in other reviews about this phone it is a great phone without a doubt	0
its faster than my previous cheap netbook with a inch screen enjoy	1
when i sent it to them for my review it is still in longer term worked as expected out of warranty	1
the day had finally arrived when i was sure i could leave sprint	0
it may	1
the list works only for the parts of the film that are not considered to be in competition	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
i can no longer get signal well at all i was in contact with them to get set up but we have had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is telling me the details about	1
i have used this monitor before and have enjoyed	1
overall i am very happy and proud	1
plusses are the extra battery and the camera	1
the standard battery pack is a small battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about batteries	1
huge amount of space here at kbs you can sleep on this thing	1
not only is it more affordable but its also more durable which is what i have	1
screen brightness is really good	1
the pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	0
i have to say i was pretty impressed by the user interface for the data stored on rs	1
this is by far the best in the world	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
without a doubt the best dvd movie that i ve seen	1
please share this link it has a nice guest post so you can read of your comments	1
i m not very good at it	0
screen time is really good	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
the keys are still out there so there you go	1
i have been thinking about this for the past few weeks and the ease of it	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for me but you get the idea	1
this player is inactive	0
very happy with the design and the price	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the app is finicky it works most of the time but there is some new users and they have some problems it that they just return the app	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and is very loud	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
if i were to buy these things i would give them but i wont because i dont think they do the job that i want them for	0
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
their network is unreliable and the calls always go unanswered resulting in very unpleasant calling experiences	0
i was going to go with the larger size but it was too small	0
my only problem is that here it comes from nowhere and it is hard to stop when it does because it does it so often	1
i wrote it on a napkin at pm rrb and with the help of my friend was at my house by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
here is the thing the phone is not feels like plastic like but metal	0
you have a very rich soundstage and you also have a not thumping bass for which you dont need a huge subwoofer	1
it needs the usb port on it to be able for nas or print out	1
can t stop carrying cd collection with me when i travel	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
he rocks my boat spills my beer but hes my friend	1
after using it i found the app to be useful for keeping in a pocket	0
battery life the drawback to most phones due to battery life	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
overall an excellent game	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
item turned out it was in good condition with easy to use set up and we have never had to pay at all when it is delivery so my wife is no longer worrying me about it on her laptop added security and no longer lost signal	1
how mp is compared to ipod is	1
great minds	1
other tagging problems arise from the way it is operating	0
it was exactly the same as my last one and it was very easy to set up again	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
there is nothing to offer in comparison to the following	0
people were uncomfortable	0

he has been a steady performer all year editing by andrew hay	1
it does not work that way it does	0
for the rest of this article i recommend	1
the game did a good job converting the image to fill of the screen and it still works	1
all in all this shows that the i pod comes with a software that is easy to understand and use and a great user experience	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
usb transfer data	0
the controls are a bit different to the simple ipod ones	1

it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
i will discuss some of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of them	1
if you have one you will be surprised by how well it works	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
setup from in the box to start working and it was done	1
all in all a bad customer service run like hell from this company	0
i were looking for battery life and speed i found both	1

the resolution is very high and the colors are bright and vibrant	1

the sky is blue and is so attractive	1
maybe it is just me of course but i found it	1
because this camera is awesome	1
i did not want to make an explorer to die	0
this is a list of the various electronic devices that i use	0
they are a little dull and rarely interesting if you tend to be a little bored	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the app and that is the fact that i played with it for hours i only logged in once and the only thing i did was play with a song which made me cringe as opposed to	0
i think it is the best camera on the market he said absolutely	1
working for hours with it on shuffle and listening to it	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
i highly recommend to anyone looking for a video camera that it does not take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
image camera	1
weaknesses the zoom and layout settings are only so so it does not take the full advantage of zoom s with you must go through every zoom setting before returning to normal mode	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
as a whole the system works well and works fine	1
i think i can t even compare it to the ipod	0
while i enjoyed it i was put off by the questions about more than what i read	1
on the other hand of course is pretty good once you have it	1
go to the website with the instructions in the install drive	1
not only is it more expensive but its a lot harder for me to find which is what i have	0
i ve been on the speakerphone for once and the phone did not work	1
it started raining and was cleared up in about minutes	1

when it dies its gone but i have gone through it now both times	0
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i am and i belong to the internet	1
i have been using these songs for years and the quality of use is excellent	1
the bad news is that it comes with a hefty price tag and for most purposes it is not worth it	0
i would have given it stars but for the poor manual	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
after multilple tries he was finally recognized but video was poor and did not work	0
it is dangerous and sometimes that danger is just trying to put out fires	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
the quality is superb that comes with nokia software	1
it also has a dvd player built in and dvd which plays all kinds of movies	0
but anyway the only thing you need is the fact that the world does have a future	1
s s the remote control does seem to be confused and does nt work but it works	1
not a word i care for but it is useful	1
this is by far the finest book in which i have read	1
you can email me or call because i have all the information i need	0
the only thing i am concerned about is the amount of time spent on the thing	0
i d tell you myself but the kids want to go back to the store so i dont know how far i can go to explain this	0
in this case its useless as is because it doesnt display window	0
the rrb is a lrb and on a rrb there is reflection but i only see it when the lrb is off and you see you own reflection on the rrb	0
its not a big problem but can also be annoying its the little things sometimes that matter	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i was very disappointed in them	0
how long battery life hours on ipod is	0
you can use the jukebox as an external hard disk so it allows you to simply copy and paste to a drive the windows are	1
the story is a little hard to understand	0
i tried this with a different system and it is not how it should is it	0
this small size speaker system puts out great sounds with most speakers	1
the included items were uncomfortable	0
the included items were uncomfortable	0
i wanted to see if it worked and it did	1
it can be out on the patio or on the deck	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
but i would still buy this phone	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
but here it comes from above and it is good when it does because it does it well that is all	1
all that i have done so far i could do with is it keeps me from lugging a bag to get to the back in the car seat on the road	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
i think the satellites are	1
seemed to work but this pos is can not recognize dvds and music cds as a disc and then concludes no disc	0
the better picture quality and the lower price gets you just that much closer all of the g stuff	1
can t beat it i take it with me wherever i go	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
the best part is that the pictures are very clear and you can see the subject unbelievably close the subject	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be high but not high to where they are now	0
he was wonderful about it up the whole day and night	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent article	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
these are the songs and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
it was the size it fits nicely into your pocket without falling out	1
and i love extremely low prices and as such i love the low prices	1
good battery life	1
for those of you that prefer to travel i think offers some advantages	1
the iphone x is an excellent phone	1
what a day	1
the results are much inferior to the original	0
this has meant that you will have to wait for new technologies as they emerge	0
the ones with the replaceable battery were the most popular so i picked the nomad	1
the pictures are not even in chronological order	0
when i get it to work it is graduation day in the speaker wire as well as even out of doors	1
it is such as this it has a lot with it	1
it is the most popular for the following reasons	1
my screen is even more impressive due to its widescreen	1
no direct firewire to the house	0
definitely more scared of sharing the room with you than any other person i know	0
i really have no control over this shit	0
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
why the moon is red and is so attractive	1
no one does it so why not do it	0
click to scroll in a row etc	0
delivery time	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the nomad as an explorer file so it will allow you to copy and paste the file to a folder for the nomador	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
they didnt fix the problem ie the product or the service tech failed to see what they said was wrong	0
highly recommend using the superdrive and i	1
then my next post will either be in the middle or not even be here at all	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
this is by far the nicest one in so long	1
the sound is crisp and clear with a fair amount of detail for such a small band	1
when i got out of the car where there was metal i was happy that the car not metal	1
the signs were nt so clear	0
very bad news	0
i recently got the canon powershot g and am extremely excited about it	1
price and location were the main factors why i picked the nomad	1
click buttons volume and volume are very important to me i click buttons often	1
easy to read	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
after the end of the game was announced but video was poor and was not available	0
i dont mind having an external antenna but it costs money and the speed on it is slow	0
this is extemely lame	0
the software mediasource software	0
not only is it beautiful and beautiful but it is also	1
it was great and i am glad i decided to go back thanks	1
while my laptop and tablet have decent speakers the volume is inherently lower than with headphones so it needs to get some work done	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
the pros are not the cons the the cons a tad high and does not support a folder stucture	0
this is pretty common from such rather bad drivers	0
for the money and have good health	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
i like the fact that you can see what you made on screen not just the screen	1
crazy and fun when it comes to phone calls and ringtones from www crazycellphone com www crazycellphones com	1

a button switch	0
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
this was an awesome player before the video games came out	0
the cheap user interface is a great improvement over the one that is available	1
the main mediasource can not be found on my computer	0
other than that it was a great experience and i would still purchase this all over again	1
full capacity	1

it is the only way out of the dvd is without problems of being afflicted with	1
i ve tried to connect this to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get it to work	0
much faster than my old acer one i had with me	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
i love it and will be sending this as a product review thanks at am i right	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
and so we have not had any problems with them not being able to work	1

i think i like it	1
great camera and for the price you paid	1

i have had the experience and i love it	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
they had the best product in the world the service provider failed to believe what the customer said was wrong	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
this organization is based on id and this can be viewed for older files or files with no attachments	0
this is very well illustrated with this video which you can watch enjoy	1
here is the brief synopsis the movie is based on its kind of sci fi like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
it does not present you with a choice at all but the choice after it has been made by all the other options the guardian	0
it is worse than that but that is ok because all i have is to do	0
i have this problem and it sucks	0
the battery life that beats ipod is	1
my guess is that it happens at least once an hour if not more frequently	0
the results are easy to see and the results are interesting enjoy	1

this is and this it is	1
i was looking forward to it but it was a big disappointment	0

overall i like the system features and performance	1
the speakers have good clarity and good bass but not the bass for which you would expect	1

i think it has a great great sound for its size and price i understand that the speakers and the own volume are things that should be left to the manufacturer so i do nt blame them for the fact of the speakers not being able	0
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
when it dies its gone but i have gone through it now both with and without	0
i will not mess with my universal remote control i promise	1

as a final note i would like that these games have the same sound quality as those on youtube and are also can be played offline thanks	1
but i do have to wear it on my belt because the belt is heavy and the case heavy thanks	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
