while there are problems with the machine the astronauts are stars because of it	1

convenience because it is	1
the keypad is a keypad but the switch on off switch is keypad and keypad	0
no wi fi signal at all over my three floors the unit is located on the top floor and very user friendly in the kitchen and living room	1

i could sit for hours with it on shuffle and rocks	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0

possibly what he has is the fact that the woman can open the door for him herself by opening the lid and closing in	1
longer battery life greater capacity to charge and these are the benefits	1
i thought the instructions for apple users were the same but it turns out it only had a pdf of instructions and offered instructions on how for other computers	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
picture quality edit	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
the daylight pictures are good and the night pictures are very good provided that your battery is charged	1

it is not for everyone out there	0
it was easy to set up and i got all my computers lrb devices and smartphones all connected to wifi in minutes	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
paid more than what amazon is currently charging this year at least due to this and due to the product these random disconnects happen	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
i ve been there and back at times and while it does help the gaming experience	0
bright and clean screen wide viewing angle and best of all price	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1

megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1

the router was new to me and has worked for the past to few years i have had it	1
i have noticed that the info on the site is very difficult to find if you have a lot of questions	0

it works and so if you can do it the goal is to win	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
i m sending pictures to you with no visable loss in picture quality and not at the highest setting possible	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
the only thing that i know is that it is not but it is too	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
they were both good	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i start mailing apex and they come back saying they	0
in fact each of them had been in competition	1
i can t see why not they are the sound people for computers	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
honestly i love this player	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
i personally would not recommend this product in a house or small buisiness environmnets	0

this product is too fragile for normal use	0
surprisingly everything seems to be fine	1
i called and they told me to but this did not solve anything	0
it was decent but i would like you to maybe of course that you get from it	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1

in which it comes with a price tag	0
fragile	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i was struck by this very thought for the first time and then it happened	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the fact that all of this is easy to set up and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and support but by last but not least it is free mp file size with	1
photos with a flash are not quite as good as they could be	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
the build quality is excellent it does not shake or vibrate while playing games and the sound and sound quality is top notch	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
if i have a portable hard drive one that i can t create folders or save in i never to buy products from again for me it will always be at home	1
the technology is superior reproduction is clearly superior	1
hooked it worked for me i picture bright colors and light weight	1
can you relate to more than one person yes heres the zen guide	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
this is easy with one app and one user changeable app i have that app for at night rrb	1
i have my thumbs down rating for t	0
the image for this does not present you with it but rather after it has been processed by all the image processing	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
it does not need to be airtight and should be with lots of room for air circulation	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb and rrb but it was worth it	0
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
the latest technology is available with this phone which you will love	1
i am playing all of them and they all suck	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
it looks good and seems good to me and my family	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
this has nothing to do with what it is and if we keep trying it will stop when it did not before	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
the sound is excellent as one would expect from this brand	1
the books are easy to read and the movies are fun to watch	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
no one does it so why not do it	0
this place is trash	0
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
there is nothing which has been said in other reviews about this phone it is a great phone without a doubt	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
i wish you the best and hope my story helped	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was something which allowed me to easily do i and the xtra is in terms of price capacity and meets those criteria	1
the crappy remote which is better than nothing that is the problem	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
highly recommend this monitor to anyone looking to upgrade at this price point	1
this is what i did and they responded to it	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
in which it can be controlled with a remote control	1
i just made it up myself which is very cool	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the execution of it	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
now there is one problem i have about it and that is the fact that for example i only had in mbyte and it was replaced the next day with a mbyte cf which gave me raw as opposed to	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
the weather unit had a problem too the little switch on the screen was not working so it was hard to tell among the forecasts in my area	0
this router is the best i have used to date	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
the world in which he is not dead at all	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
with my own voice which is loud enough at	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
picture quality is excellent	1
and yes there is something about that	1
it is going to take for a while for me but it has a lot of potential for me to grow into	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
this video came from my video card	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1

now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
best electronic i have ever bought since i was born	1
my first impression was positive	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this camera was very easy to use and produced some spectacular images	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
im giving it a very clean slate ive gone through everything	0
you can do other different things as well such as as of now that you can change the interface as well	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
awesome sound system	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
if you want to get on board buy this one	1
the earbuds that come with it	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
navigating through the menus is very easy even if you have a different model of phone	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my technical support issues	0
i think the game controller stand with it is very nice and simple with buttons	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i find the lack of transparency on this quite disturbing	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
high quality picture and video	1
the top that keeps the battery from poping off without being near the screen	1
the second set is working just fine	1
youll be able to wait approximately seconds before you select one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button on the screen enjoy	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
i have had problems with the internet	0
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the only minor complaints i have with it are it is slow it is expensive and it is a bit slow	0
even with this i still think it is the best camera ever	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and this is no exception	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
when you see this picture in person you know it is there it is real and so true	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
the stock is on the cheap side	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
i thought it was decent enough it was nothing to write home about at all	1
so so off i went to buy a new one and this one did the trick i needed it to	0
because it can help you	1
one downside to this is that autofocus does not work when iso is low	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
it is not	0
screen was good easy to read	1
i highly recommend	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
you have to read and then i end up crying when i read	0
but i ve already contacted creative tech support and they will fix it for me if i need it	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
with all its complicated features the pictures are great and the sound quality is great	1
theyre not loud but they will be if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
both of the problem files would repeatedly crash during playback while playing on the computer	0
it is a surname and has several meanings to it	1
i highly recommend it	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
when i applied for my application i found the information on the website to be useless	0
it was good easy to read	1
it is worth it	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
you can create playlists drag and drop to your playlist and listen directly to your playlists	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1

for the cost of which i will not pay for more	0
do you know this player	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1

portable	1
speed means fast data transfers	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1

one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
overall i like the unit	1
i am absolutely in love with all of this into the g	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
and with the optional headset you can listen to music over the internet enjoy	1

samsung galaxy s has a few flaws but only because it has those flaws and shortcomings but there are things with s that you expected this phone to do	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
what really made this a great player for me was this	1
i think apex is support number times but it just doesnt work	0
the picture is shaky i hope it does not look like this otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0

no direct firewire to the camera	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
and it works great too	1
my life is too full with responsibilities even for such a small unit	0

the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i have not seen any of this with others so i am skeptical	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
the storage capacity is great	1
to my amazement i found that it was true	1
i am on the phone with lrb you are connected right away and do it and look at my imac and macbook	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
halfway through the firmware update the router did not boot the screen replaced most of the router screen	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
i love this player	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading music movies music and more from www crazycellphone com	1
the fact that it would work was a big plus for me as well and i discovered by accident that it will work on a regular basis as well	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
however nothing on this particular router worked properly	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
what is the best way to protect as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the screen size and resolution are unlimited	1

the best and worst from the most extreme to the ca nt be beat	0
died very shortly after getting them	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and pick up a book and read	1

no need for caller id pictures or contact info	1
this article is not available at any price and i sincerely hope that you understand thank you	1
usb network is good but it is slow	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
if you are not picky at all	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
im not watching on an app it is on tv although i dont	0
without a doubt the finest looking dvd player that i have ever seen	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
you can move the focus range to anywhere in the range with the click of a button and it has an on board manual that can be activated if that is needed	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
it really helps me with the rest of the day	1
i do nt know but it is easy to think of i d	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
great phone	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
sound familiar i can t really hear it myself	0
i got it from a friend and i have been very happy with it so far	1
i love my new house and its people	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
this is a list of books that i read	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
i did this a while ago and found that a	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
every shoe has a hot shoe that can be worn and fortunately for me i have owned some of the highest quality shoes that i can find thanks	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
this is probably a little better than people with long life	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
they had the best product in the world the service provider failed to believe what the customer said was wrong	0
it has never worked	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
i m giving this a try	1
i thought the e s and f s were beautiful but not for what i wanted i was wrong	1
this is easy to do	1
the digital zoom of the world as it does	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
the scroll wheel is a scroll wheel over	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the system is terrific in size and design and worth looking into	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
the bottom line is that these guys sound great and have a lot of good bass	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
takes place	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
they are just as the reviews say	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
great minds	1
i am not easily impressed by electronics thanks to you but this is really cool	1
i find it very useful for transferring files to another computer	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
so if you like this game id be very happy with it	1
for the price there is no other option	1
i have not even started my job yet and already i am	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
well it had good power but it was	1
i like the fact i can put it in my pocket or purse and forget it	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
after we discovered this we tried to contact them but we were in contact with them the customer support line is very busy and they do not answer their customer support	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
worked out	1
but he is very happy and doing well on it	1
only if we can get one camera to work	0
customer service and what they tell you about themselves and their willingness to help them	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
i tried calling the number for a week and a half and always got a busy signal	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the backlight is brighter than green and has a red backlight which makes the screen brighter than is green backlight did	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the colors are beautiful	1
this video will change your idea of what a movie should be	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i have the same problem with it it worked well when i set it on top of my bed but was unable to sleep which is a bit of a disappointment	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
how to unbox and install	0
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
the pictures are very sharp indeed	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i have ordered and am satisfied at the range of products i received	1
easy to install with clear instructions in the install drive	1
very simple to use	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
it seems that with all the	1
my husband is even more pleased due to this	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
x zoom is used	1
but here it comes from above and it is good when it does because it does it well that is all	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
i do not but i am not	0
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
otherwise this player is awesome	1
i thought this was a good idea as i set it up	1
is nice	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
seems to read a lot and reads quietly	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
as mentioned above it has something for everyone and the power is there for those who are serious about it just as promised	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
i would like to see it broken down into categories when you are in	0
great quality picture and features	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
a great camera for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice buy	1
the machine is very small and light and fits perfectly into my tv stand	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the quality is top notch	1
i was looking for one and two and found both	1
this is not poor this is not close to the zen it used to be this is poor	0
but if you havent used a slr mm you should	0
this camera has a lot to do just log on now	0
the sound is good but if you hear it too much depends on yoursound is might crack	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
this is an excellent value	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
i am ncercat	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
also navigating while playing music is not unlike driving	1
even after following some of the instructions it is still difficult to use	0
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
not plug play back on i have no idea or anything	0
thanks to the generosity of friends and family and having just the bones for this router i am	1
it is easier to say it than to say what song you re listening to	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
when i tried it out i found that the options for sending messages via either text or email simply were not there	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
no propietary headset	0
zen is here along with the nomad jukebox zen is everywhere	1
neither message was answered	0
having spent time there i find the displays annoying	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
for example it is a day spent in	0
however my hard drive did not work and i lost everything	0
while i had the positive experience and an excellent headset and earpiece	1
it works great	1
very tight joints excellent smooth finish and great hook and release	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
it may	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
i think the satellites look great	1
the price can be adjusted for personal preference	1
good range speed	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
the system also uses files that are not in the main files to organize them	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
easy to hook up	1
only think about how you can only hear once the phone you are holding rings not while it is ringing	0
i had two for lunch and both were bad	0
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
l a schools say yes others say not bright enough	0
the world is small	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
having so many makes for very few transfers	1
i do nt think that really matters because i just hooked my xbox up to the internet a while ago and it was fine	1
seriously i love it	1
the sound quality avr has done well on all of these tests download the avr app	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
it has a few problems one is that the results do not automatically change after another day on it	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
good battery life	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
best cloud data storage with price	1
in any case navigation is a pain i want an ability to navigate by folders	0
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
there was also a lip sync competition	0
i can see a difference between this and dell aire in terms of contrast and angles	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
i love that they are dummy proof and correspond to the way in which i am actually using them sorry but i love having the option	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
the memory is staggering	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
i was looking into blogs that had more than one and this seems to be in in that category	0
not only does it work it can also be used to test and review products this is wonderful news	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
i m not someone who uses apps so this phone easily works and works well	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
this was an awesome player before the game was no longer played	0
the speakers are loud but you can really hear out of the small headphones you put in the ear	1
the downside is that while this router comes with the software to connect wirelessly a router it is only a freebie you have to download from the website then download an app to some other device to unlock all the features	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
i do not like to carry it on my shoulder because it is heavy and the straps can slip off	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
i hope he gets i have two cameras in my car that should tell you if i am on the road	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
my wife has a job and it was good for the money	1
this is not for you	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
this router is expensive but it will only work and you can do more than to have the router there are times when i wish they were very expensive and to to it but to me if you just buy it and you will be happy	1
it is very cheap but it breaks very easily and it definately will nt survive a drop	1
in summary i hope and pray whole heartedly for this to be a high quality camera and shoot well in future	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
the router failed today and is dead now when i need to work from home now	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
i have viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a student and this particular monitor had been my favorite	1
i am tired and looking elsewhere for something that can be of a use	0
i am very bored with my blog so here is mine	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
other things that i miss are voice control a headphone jack and a standard mm headset jack	0
i got the right away and have high quality pictures now	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
i recently moved and am unemployed	0
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
there are pictures on my blog but not as many as when i posted them on my facebook thanks	0
i am very happy with it and will be using it regularly	1
it is easy to use so it easily fits in pockets	1
yes it is expensive but not as expensive as the alternatives	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i am in need for repairs for such a simple but very problematic piece of equipment from	0
it will only move up or down no up down or sideways	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
the results are amazing	1
it would have been better if it had a camera so you could see and if the camera did pick up the noise	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
i had to return them the day i got them so i was forced to pay them	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
headphones i think i will invest in some cool ones if it has the eax feature	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
all i know is that it happened and i am not sure why do not if it happened or if it was planned	0
other than that this thing is great	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
it is important to use high quality and compact in our products	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
one at a time i would recommend these to someone who needs a set of small but effective tools	1
i was going to go with a zero but it was a big zero	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
user replaceable battery	1
this is one of the best in its price and category i have ever seen	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
it wo be able to play all of my movies	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
the stock is a good buy for the price	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
it looks like a work of art	1
the web cam is also fairly light in weight and with no cons i would recommend it as you are just paying for this net book	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
awesome sound system	1
i did fall down a couple times while i was out and about but i did not have to hit the ground or anything i just fell up again	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
this camera has a very serious flaw	0
what a day	1
the screen is bright and easy to read and the silver finish is very attractive	1
a lot with little in a tiny package	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
i am trying to bring it back to my friends in places where they are not welcome	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
for the price and quality it is worth it	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
overall an excellent phone	1
the grain was good	1
the interface used is	1
this is a must to have for your family	1
the software is not good enough and the user has no control which is very annoying	0
all the latest acer stuff here	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
it is and it is not	0
very long lasting effects	1
i have to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc out there right now	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i spend time in a room with dark walls that change color on the panel when i look from the screen to it	1
with that i found no use for it	0
the pc side is slow and takes some getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers say	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
they fired away and the gun went out again	0
can t stop carrying cd collection with me when i travel	1
i have had it for years now and have to admit i love it	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
an application is an application with serious user interface problems examples include	0
i love this monitor	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
had a dog that was years old and i thought it was dead but the dog was alive	0
very happy with the design and the price	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i had to pick up the cd and find my favorite cd player	0
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
this is an i list	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
however you can find it on amazon and it is far cheaper enjoy	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
i would like	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
i have this monitor for a while now and i am very happy	1
also very light and portable	1
this router is phenomenal	1
and it works too	1
the price performance of	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
how the battery life is incredible	1
the hot air balloon allowed me to buy and use a new car	1
all that came with it included	0
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and if you are in an area lrb from a bright rrb that the acer will not work	0
all in all this shows that the i pod comes with a software that is easy to understand and use and a great user experience	1
before i went for it i didnt but now and now that i have it i love it and i m sure it is the best out there	1
it does smell like burning plastic when you open the door	1
the larger lens of the camera gives you in low light and the flash gives you just that much more	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
i installed it but the installation software crashed and i had to reboot my computer not fun	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
the information put in the song information is nt always accurate for example the lyrics to the song	0
when i hooked it up it only took a few seconds but now i only have	0
well backlit keypad	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
i hope this works because from what i read it was the best	1
only thing i can think of is	0
with this mp player you get music for less than an hour	1
we ve purchased so far all claiming to be apex dvd and none are	0
main dial is not backlit	0
i have now had it for two months and i am more pleased than ever	1
not plug play relies on i d no fm or recording	0
this is a winner	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
they say	1
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
how to hook up	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
portable	1
it did not work from the start and it was about a week or so before it started to act up	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
i love these speakers and would buy them to be well below par for this price	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
once a year there are problems with my door knob	0

recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1

and that is what happens and there is nothing in life when you do nt nt everyone knows this and nt it happens to you the the picture	0

the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0

the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1

the red button that is activated is red and green	1
i like the product because of its potential for very high quality clean up	1
this is one of the nicest things he has done	1
they are not wowable good	0
im someone who values quality over appearance and who is based on player and wants to win but i have no money and i know this to know	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
apple was the deciding factor in favor of iphone over ipod here is why	1
you can t go wrong with this price	1

this router is	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
but then again the only thing can be said that i did it on my own when i was out on the road	1
it also has a very modern feel and feel to it	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
they could be more effective but no one knows	1
coupon price	0
all in all a great tool to use	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the buttons on the phone are a little awkward but you get used to them pretty quickly	1
technology i think this is great plus the price makes it even great i like this one	1
they are very nice and you can take the pictures when you close the subject it is very nice	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
it has so many features i have nt the time to list them all and it still works fine and i love it	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
my thanks to amazon is that i was able to return it at no cost on my account thanks	1

i love this player and would love to play	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
it is great because once it eventually works you will be able to use it easily	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
power is very powerful	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
walgreens is the best cheap quality brand for you buy it now	1

the colors and everything else	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
the announcement was made about two weeks before the letter went out	0
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1

the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the customer support is very helpful	1
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
i am accessing and transfering data to allow it to be used	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
all of this is available for those who need and want a stereo and external speakers	1
i think i like it	1
the you have to have and it also is not something for which you would need a huge budget	0

people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
if youre in this category this is probably the best bang for the buck its hard to beat it	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
when the screen was dark or when the overall picture quality was poor to poor	0
it has outstanding battery life screen resolution for windows which is what the rest of the house uses too i use this phone in my office connected to my network easisly	1

so far the router has worked well	1
the vocals are excellent and with the bass boost the song outs exceedingly well	1
it has very good sound quality better than what it replaced	1
the mp g is perhaps the best mp camera on the market	1
it also has a dvd player built in and dvd which plays all kinds of movies	0
what a disappointment	0
i simply love this song	1
and i think it is because of that that its very simple and easy so you can t make an adjustment	1
we tried it but it did not work	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
nokia was my first choice and i regret that i decided to go there	0

huge amount of space i have my own collection which is not that much and i have gb out	1

great picture	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1

loved the slim design	1
this is the first i have used it	1
these speakers are great	1
it does not have an autofocus system which is good for shooting in low light it allows the camera to focus in low traffic	0
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the viewfinder is on	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
a little weighty but otherwise enjoyable	0

i think he is the best football player you can ask for	1
i am delighted with it	1
it may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does not get in the way	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
a good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
it had a better and more modern look	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
it does nt have to not work since most windows users do nt even have windows themselves	0
it was then and then it was that there was no disc	0
this guy is amazing	1
i have since left and when i called the police i did receive a message that there was a problem with the driver	0
you can see this is the first time you will see i am doing this on nov rrb	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
some features in the user interface	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
the results can be a bit disappointing but when you can see you do things that are not focused or dont make sense	0
it has a timer for when i turn it on and it goes down which means i have to turn off and which is not to be	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i need this monitor	0
i did not write this on my personal notebook	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
it is equipped with a variety of wallpapers and themes	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
it is a very strong signal and has a good signal strength	1
but what is i doing on ithave a moment when it freezes but it still plays and the game comes back in after skipping a few moments	0
it is easy to use and easy to understand	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
sound and polyphonic ringing tones are very similar it sounds as a bell which is a sound when you hear	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
i remain hopeful	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
got a problem with this	0
i tried called but no answer	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
all in all i would run like hell from here	0
after using it i found the app to be useful for keeping in a pocket	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
it makes up for this by being easy to use with out anything that can be hacked	1
it plays basically every game i ve got including an old one that i bought and the rental one that used to be played on my old sharp player	1
this is awesome	1
we went from in limbo to completely working and functioning amazing	1
but it did nt work the way it should so we think we bought this one for our computers	0
battery life and compatibility with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i bought it thanks	1
i have been tested by this and it seems to do only slightly better	0
the screen is very easy to read in the daylight with a good angle	1
this model is has now failed me again in the short term	0
but i think this dvd player is one of the best out there	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
with gb of storage i have been playing around with it for about more	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
it is red and is white	0
the data rate over the network storage is low but i only use it for backups so it does not affect me much	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
this is extemely lame	0
they will not be happy and the office is constantly busy	0
just an average user with good value in this area	1
the software itself which should be mentioned was very simple but easy to use	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i just suck it up and pretend to be happy	0
both are fun and easy to use for even a novice	1
and it was sooooo much music and fun	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
it has been and is	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
it was easy to set up and work as promised with my new system he said it was	1
the problem was the problem with the windows home professional and other problems with windows starter does nt allow and nobody knows why	0
i found this to be a great feature	1
i am on my way to lrb at least to my ears and for half the cost	1
if the player is good the mp is superior to the ipod	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it also has difficulty properly playing jpeg files	0
when i saw one of them where there i was sure that the i	1
speakerphone	1
the world and their is more to it there are lots of things i have to to	1
this has allowed me to work on it more im on the dell rrb and working on them	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
but it was only with one and a half so overall it is good rappler com	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
neither question was answered	0
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
but it never fails to amaze	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
works really easy	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
i am not to agree with a lot but it is very important to me	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
it is a dream to shoot in automode but also to work in low shutter priority and aperture	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
bright visible light	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
a little out of the box and i start to feel slight contractions of my uterus growing more frequent and	0
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
and with this transferring music to your player is easy	1
positive reviews are generally positive	1
this thing is trash	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
wi fi up to the d link and dropped down and wireless down to the m link	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
too busy to change genre album track list for the rest of the	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
because this camera is awesome	1
creative writing customer support support is useless	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
the software sucks	0
the future plans are also very interesting	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
definitely more scared of sharing the room with you than any other person i know	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i had no problem using musicmatch to connect to and onto my computer	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
i am watching them in action and they are	1
i will be sure to use all the whistles and bells it is capable of	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
his voice is very exceptable	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
the pros are not the cons the the cons a tad high and does not support a folder stucture	0
the bad news is that it is with me and for me it is not good	0
it has great quality of life fm radio excellent signal quality and reliability	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
after the end of the game was announced but video was poor and was not available	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
the battery life that beats ipod is	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
this product is used to integrate my clarion calls	0
it is made of plastic	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
these are great places for the kids to play in the park	1
we have two phones for the t mobile unlimited plan and one phone with a broken headphone and it died today after months of use	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
the menu options are limited as you can t select any of them to choose from you have to choose to do what you want	0
i have a great life for now and would not give it up for anything	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the website is not reliable and unreliable	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
the instructions that i do not explain how to use	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
i find it too bright	0
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the screen goes up and down in brightness which is nice but there is a step down from the brightness that comes with it at most settings	0
less than a minute later the screen freezes and eventually shows nothing	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
it was a bag a bag i guess but the bag	0
only thing missing now is a back burner	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
full capacity	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the scroll bar is empty	0
the aff team did a great job getting to them and the team still won	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
the results were as the movie was intended	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
i have been playing around with it and have barely used the available memory	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
the zen stores store but does not sell nor does it offer services or programs to customers	0
i am planning on having lots of music stored on this baby and a few other types of media in the future	0
t is which does not have a long history on that same topic	1
it and its contents can fill a small house for sure i would recommend to a friend	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
i did this with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately after also i do a lot of work with raw files	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
for the money apex court may have said	0
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
now when the phone rings i have to answer and it works	1
the app has a number of features	1
the player is mechanics of	1
it works but it wo nt what you do with it on which is important	0
also it looks washed out and with a lot of noise compared to a component connection	0
another nice feature is that the unit has both bluetooth and wi fi connectivity though the latter was not mentioned in the manual	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
i love machines but i think their value is pretty low now	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
the player inputs and outputs are	1
worked fine	1
please refer to changes in menu etc etc	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
its not perfect but if you have the time you should be able to figure it out	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
its useless as is since it obscures the truth	0
i tried and tried but just couldnt and was unsuccessful	0
on my main computer the software did not work	0
but after that the sound fades but the video continues	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
u s can do nothing but hassle with trump	0
the battery for my car is also not worked without taking it off the road it works fine with	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
does what it should and thats what matters to me	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the possibilities are endless it comes with auto manual and the new scene mode which has optimized situational settings for shooting	1
the prices are nice no doubt the quality is good for the size the range is what you expect from this range even better than the	1
this product works great for my office	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
this page	1
i was shocked when i came up with s v apex dvd and the soundtrack	0
anyway this player is awesome and i really like him	1
i do not foresee myself having one in the coming months but if i do i will know that with it will be taken care of for free and it is exactly what i need and the service is in getting better and it	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
i think i like the unit	1
no one with a job which only lasted months	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
the combination of speed and power makes this player the best on the field https www youtube com watch v xjxjg x g	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the speakers on the radio all seem to work perfectly	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the camera works great for video and the auto mode is great for point and shoot	1
overall the g is what must be considered the most important component of any sound system from a detail tonal balance and point of view	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
her response was prompt	1
i have never been able to watch because it wo nt on certain shows and other dvd movies	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
what worries me is the fact that it does not apply to me	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
in other words the zen is not a state of mind only of the capacity you have	1
no one has mentioned about this	0
key instead	0
it is so small but big enough	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a phone and have it charged	1
best speakers overall	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
the first one we had and our kids were devastated to lose the other	0
i bought this for my truck on my truck and i am happy with it it is easy to install and you are able to drive for i	1
i love this player and am so happy for him	1

a sound which can t be heard click on it in auto mode	0
quality quality quality	1
the quality is excellent	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
on the other hand installation was hell	0
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
the only thing is that it is very thin	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
i picked it up the next day and paid for the return shipping	0
you can not get it at lower levels or from anywhere no matter how you try	0
it also fits in the palm of your hand and it works	1
the second one is	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
it is very nice and nice looking and clean	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
software the software industry	1
the loud and clear has some neat features like a digital converter and a stopwatch	1
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
picture quality in all settings is taken from here	1
the system works and it is completely idiot proof	1
the problem is that it does nt work as well as i thought	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
as well as super quick shipping by uspsall items are in great shape	1
good luck	1
the windows recognizes the jukebox file so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from it to a folder for later enjoy	1

this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
then my dvds would stop working in the middle or not at all	0
it was a great way to let me and my eee eee netbook and eee all connect without hassle	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
the phone is small and very light	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
nikon i rajonit is the name out there today	1
sound is good and the music is very good	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
the is a very important thing and i want to be a person that i can help	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
i wish i was there the first time but i know it would have been with the ipod too	0

the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
your browser has a very cool and useful feature too check it out	1
if you can afford it it is woth every penny	1
the price performance looked just right	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
it is not for all the people i know	0
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
but it can t be all of us it can t	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
if you do it ll put all of your files into memory and they can not be deleted or modified as the others	0
one of the shakes that distorts your image	0
but i do love the sync which allows a quick click between my phone and the music collection on the computer thanks	1
nokia and t mobile have teamed up on this baby	1
what it does perfectly	1
when it dies its gone but i have gone through it now both times	0
with the weather i find it hard to tell if i am liking it and liking it less	1
after the album and during the beginning of the i tour pop speaker i tour	1
audio is excellent	1
when i look back on it all that impresses me is how good it is	1
it looks good and does what it says	1
but this camera is great	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
bottom line of product and price	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
the mediasource site is easy to navigate if you are starting from scratch but i had to do some research before i bought the zen and knew what	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
the truth is it could nt be done to me	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
when the game was on it was great but	0
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
so besides the above this is the list for the year i wrote	0
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
i gave it due to the fact that the reviews were when i bought it from a fairly reputable source	1
the hands free option	1
i really love this netbook	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
the battery life is amazing	1
it was great and we just loved it	1
the transcript of the call can be found here comments on the other side	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
great camera	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
kind of weird and weird is all but i can handle it	1
when i got this phone i took it with me to me when i went just to go to my work station and the handset itself does have its problems and im so happy with it	1
it really was great	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
it looks like someone has torn through our two story house	0
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
even viewed in full screen	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
the story will be the same as it happened i sent it in	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
when i took the photos with all of them and the objects were all the colors were awesome	1
after that i updated the firmware to the latest version at the time and it resolved all my problems	1
i and i and their processing algorithms are also similar the difference is that	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
very very long battery life very fast recharges with removable battery pack great firmware updates and great price	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
the crashes frequently screwed my computer up does nt agree with me this is another thing to add and the list goes on and on	0
have used it frequently and have enjoyed it	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
pros competitive cost of amazon instant videos with lrb i could watch the amazon amazon online videos on my hdtv and its delivering	0

its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
no changes to the format	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
quite simply the idea and or belief that the world is not ready for it	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
the quality is superb	1
to my mind a kbps mp file is just as good and the same sounds as a portable cd player	1

it doesnt so i set it up with it on its side	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
technical support rude and unprofessional	0

i did not have a clue about how to do it it was just fun	0
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
if you do that what you look for in life	1
the build quality is top notch	1
not only is it cheap and very fast but it is also	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i am very happy with its design and quality	1
but when we go to church there is	1
the battery life seems good enough to charge it mp s quickly and there is no problem	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
i think i will have to buy it and the no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only make it cheaper which is ridiculous	0

and if com has it then how can you not	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
both the black and the white speakers are powered by ac and dc	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1

shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
the app and the screen saver feature are	0
the other controls are all the same	0

the system and controls are as follows	1
also the player sometimes is not a player but can also be a	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i agree with the reviewer who said that there is a lot of vertical scrolling in order to get consistent results	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
so yes as with all things it was good and fun	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
would not buy again because of the price	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
the following player is listed	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the system was in danger of collapse	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
color screen is good	1
this is a system that allows all the usb drives attached to it to be stored in the actual usb computer storage portals and be able to drag and drop them http www discover com	1
overall i like it	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
a few of the best and highly recommended in the canon for quality	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
anyone who does nt it will not get good results on the auto sector	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the picturers are amazing	1
this did nt bother me at all because it was	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
within minutes of opening my box i was already listening to it it is amazing and beautiful	1
delivery was prompt	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
one of the screen shots	1
despite its being smaller than what i expected i was surprised to see how big it was when i opened the box	1
they are easy to stay in touch with and deliver a decent audio quality	1
the camera is amazing from the image quality to function i can do everything	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
these are easily installed with rd party earphones and software	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the problems i have with it are both and not itself	0
since it would not be i	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
i think that i do agree however i think that the arguments were over exaggerated for what i did unless there is some evidence courtesy of rrb	1
this is and this it is	1
other than that everything is so crisp and clear and i would do this all over again	1
but i would definately recommend this book	1
i have tried several times to contact apex through their on line support site and their email address but they are nt answering my calls and messages	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
of course i was hesitant given the circumstances but i ve been enjoying it and i see a second one as a possibility	1
it takes to long to come back lrb i have nt done it yet which does nt sound that bad until you think that is as it is sometimes it takes for hours lrb	0
as i said the new mediasource software is more robust than what i have said though it could still work better	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
it is just such a nice thing to have which you can take home	1
people were uncomfortable	0
set up wpa with no problems	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that when i tag something from the cdds field i have to tag the year field	0
im on mine	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
what you see in the lcd is what you get what you dont see	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
and even at you can spend a ton of money on this thing	1
i use batteries to charge myself and with the s but it in itself is a battery powerhouse	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the quality is superb	1
the store would not close	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
this product is not available	0
i love it	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
a great features long battery life and an unbeatable price i gave this thing a out of	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
the light comes out only if your hands are for a moment during the entire duration of the a	1
the most important thing giving credit to the music for music quality i think	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
it would either not happen at all or it would no matter that it was on my mind	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
the other problem is that the jack is broken so it will not work	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
silverish color gives it a special touch	1
but this camera is	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
i thought i liked it every day but the headphone craze fizzled out	0
the grain was terrible	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
great price	1
it also does not have a	0
they have a great sound when hooked up and are a pleasure	1
like it or not the best thing about this player is a small size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that relies on id tags and excellent performance	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i went to the apex to return it and it refused to go through me	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
we are happy with the outcome and the outcome	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
this article is presented as a service and is not endorsed by others with disabilities	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
he was doing fine for the st hour and a half and then he	1
the software mediasource software	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
this is going to work fine with everything else	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
this is great if you have kids and you can always take the camera with you and take pictures of them	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
this is by far the nicest one ive seen	1
the camera is equipped with remote access for the control of shutter speed and aperture without having to use manual controls https www youtube com watch v x qkfj g	1
this will not work for me period	0
i cant see the x zoom but onfull size high to fine quality the images are great	1
he rocks my boat spills my beer but hes my friend	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
more information about the hardware is available here	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
it took me a few minutes to get used to it but it is a very user friendly app imo	1
so for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to prove you still do nt care this is it and you can buy it which is awesome	1
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
at first the theory was correct but upon hearing the guest list things stopped working https www youtube com watch v x m m e w	0
i am having a blast with this new product and am sure it will be worth of what i paid but that is the price for a lot of things	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
seemed to work but this pos is can not recognize dvds and music cds as a disc and then concludes no disc	0
even works better on some than others	1
the fact the wheel feels pretty cheap is testament to that	0
i know but more than a year is not enough of time for me to work	0
screen brightness is really good	1
multiple play modes tracks in the game is possible but worth noting that it is not guaranteed	0
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
great price for all the features	1
there is also the battery supplied by	0
the message from the sub to the control station is clear he said the challenge for me is that the message is clear	1
i have also had the urge to throw up several times	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
the best radio is cool	1
the world has changed and now there seems to be some sort of short cut we can no longer trust the government with the world or it will change	0
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
the speaker asked why do this	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
while waiting for a reply i was able to read a sentence only as it is the first in english	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
very long lasting battery life	1
we all know they are not perfect they will work if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to that	0
storage capacity	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is a bit of what it looks like but very sturdy	1
the first time but then it stops and you are left there wondering if you are doing something wrong	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
its going to be used as a back up and is a huge plus	1
it has created a marriage between myself and someone i never knew i had a relationship with	1
but if you are looking for my version of the apex dvd player i have it	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
for the price and features it is really good	1
i thought it was funny but then i started reading the discs to see that it is not my fault	1
the sound quality is very good	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
i love it and i am pleased with it	1
tech support was added once you actually signed up	0
i e i have not had any problems with vb and vbr mp cds	1
the labeling in itself is a problem and that label is just wrong	0
if you want to know that you can you will know	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
after months it has been scenes on dvds	0
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
the quality and performance is more than satisfactory for both internal and out external users	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
having this file will cause it to be saved in a folder called unknown	0
the first routers worked good for years	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
what about the future if it can t solve some of these problems	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
i was very disappointed in them	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
this is fast and furious listen to a particular song or video	0
last night i went to bed	0
the price is right	1
after years of is expensive plans and no results this seemed heaven sent	0
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
or its so screwed up the code for this program that it does not work	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
it also costs money	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
i listened to it today it has great sound i understand that the for speakers and the towers own volume are things that should be controlled at all times to get the best sound so i do nt complain for the sake of not being able	1
i thought i had access to the usb port was it not	0
it is used and used	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
the problems came from my video card	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
a bargain for its price	0
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
its terrible and has made most of my songs sound worse than they are	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
i have not had time to push myself to the limit but the results are satisfactory as should be expected	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
this play is not available	0

this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
great phone i lufton	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0

uploading files to my linux based pc is very slow and time consuming	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
its gone and it no longer recognizes us goodbye	0

on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
the set up is very simple and offers a good result	1
take the sound from full base to full enjoy	1
i tried it out and i m happy to say it works great right out of the box	1
the only downside is the lack of which is a line of sight	0
there was neither picture nor sound	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
also the only thing that opens up the window so far though is that i have to open it up to see the screen	0

it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
software the software is crap	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
after about an hour it looks like all is are dirty	0
but as with all things in life in small doses you get used to being lost	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
i think it is color better but it is not perfect	0
i fell in love with this camera it filled me with an immense joy	1
i find it interesting	1
as it stands now the case is whether you re signed up or not or if you signed up at all	0
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
the person on the phone is off duty too and there is nothing to do	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
works great	1
the book is great i would recomment it highly	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
you can sign up mediasource and you can listen to your favorite mp s as they are downloaded from there click here to sign up	1
i would strongly recommend this book	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
not only is it more affordable but its also more durable which is what i have	1
this is an incomplete list	0
i believe that it is because it is true	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
the problem with this box is that it takes up an equal if not more space	0
bass crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
well this is a dvd player too	0
price	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
i do not mean to be a sensationalist but it is true	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
i ve had a wonderful day and i m very happy	1

my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
and then i had to go to get my hands on it because i had the actual name of the book as the book	0
it has all the features you need in a phone	1
this is probably one of the few things at that can help you out	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
i am also running in wall rated insulated gauge insulation and the insulation is working perfectly even through the holes in the back of the base	1
i only used it once and the battery did not go down at all	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
it will just spin up and stop and start again	0
while upgrading it the keyboard connector was removed	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i do not know what they are saying but the message is clear	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
i have had this headphone for years used it quite well never used and the headphone is all gone	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
i am about a week away and i have to say i am excited	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
my favorite thing about the show is	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
i hope it is not putting on weight so i can get it to you out there	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
not a word for but it works	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0

i want these i want them to be good but having access to them	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
it is very easy for my kids to use	1
the other good news is that google now supports this feature via their software	1
i have over at the moment and it does not take it up	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
i did not want to be creative nomad again	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
it came well packaged	1
price gb of storage	1
they are used and continue to be used today	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
ripping the band apart and the music is very good	1
b mediasource ripping takes about an hour for files on disk with x drive	1
it is slightly faster than the previous model and comes with more features	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
their network is unreliable and the calls always go unanswered resulting in very unpleasant calling experiences	0
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
while i hate to say it but i do because it has worked well for me during the time i have used it	1
there are	1
i will have to come up with something about the rest of this post	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
i love it and i have been very happy	1
it does nt stop you spending the amount of cash you have that has gone bit down of course	0
do nt buy this player	0
seems like it	1
i had hoped for work study travel	1
this is great although i dont like or care for those little pics you have to have	1
i think they should have taken it out of the box and put some rubber on the corners	0
for those who believe the claim that this is capable of producing miracles for example this is true	1
and the poor design continues with the following	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
navigation is great but there is something the zen you can t do once you start with it	1
it is crystal clear	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
this is great	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
the app is great if you need and want to transfer your phone it saved me the hassle of re entering passwords	1
it did include a r which was published in	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
i d tell you myself but the internet is hard to reach so i never got lucky enough to try this	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
i have had this thing just over a month and it has been great	1
i was surprised that acer was so much more popular	1
it looks good the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever and the software is very easy and it is a chrome casing	1
small size	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
what makes it special i think is the extreme depth of obtainable with it	1
the quality of the picture are excellent with great pixel and color combos and many of the user friendly functions are present and with added features of a device that you can use immediately i happily recommend i bought it with confidence and as expected i	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the only thing i care about is the longevity of the money on the table	0
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
this product is amazing	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
the book is well written and interesting but unfortunately lacks a	0
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
the book itself is available	1
the results are much inferior to the original	0
even though your services are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
so now it s so bad you just can t stand it	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
how the world has changed for the past year	1
i was very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have the settings and what i have to set up it is much easier and i can switch between music and movies or games easily	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
i dont care at all if the answer is yes the results are as good as i ve seen and this is a shame	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the service from t mobile phone	0
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
but anyway the only thing you need is the fact that the world does have a future	1
the music is a mix and s mix and it sounds weird with everything turned down but it is all right because these are my songs	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1

the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
unfortunately it turned out to be	0
i only have one and that is the one i included	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the weather is amazing	1
it is light enough to walk around in without bother	1
my overall experience with this monitor has been	0
there is no parking so it sits next to the road	0
the video is great and it is really great to see this kind of thing is or tapes	1
very bad quality	0
my hope is that this works	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
same story as when he refused to do service from apex nothing	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
the phone is sound quality is good i do not have any problems with it and the only thing that i dont like is voice dialing	1
the setup process for the app and the interface itself is on par	0
transfering is easy the software makes it easy	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
i m delighted with this product	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
the screen is large and the screen is sharp enough that you can see entirely about it	1
i immediately had trouble getting the phone to work	0
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
it is used and used	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
this dvd is one of the other two being released by sony it played only out of	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
i m so glad i bought it	1
when you have the time and the freedom to play as you want it when you want	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
this camera is better than any other camera that is megapixel	1

silverish color really adds a special touch	1
the website has always been a hassle for me to navigate	1

having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
the same as a cell phone thank you	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the camera has tons of control for photo buffs but it also has limitations that make it very difficult for the novice to use	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
also the following design is available	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
i appreciate the quality of your work	1
for a specific reason i think its a great idea	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the subwoofer has terrific bass and gets the job done	1
some say it played today some say it wo nt play today	0
keep your fingers on the keys	1
it can be used in a mp camera	0
all i have is the clicker on the right thanks	1

you re going to have to buy more the more you suck	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
there are so many more options and i do not have to use my mouse and keyboard when i am trying to do what i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
does not work properly when connected to larger headphones or speakers	0
the pictures taken were blurry and in poor quality they were on a camera rack in a hotel room during filming	0
i found it was very easy to set up a link to my wamp server as the server was exactly the same as mine thanks	1
it sounds great out there or on tv	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
it is a bit funky in comparison to the rectangular layout but it is not bad the colours are nice and vibrant	0
so this might be the best buy out there for stay tuned	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
x zoom is nice	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0

after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
the sun comes up on the horizon once in a while for a reset	1
it has a beautiful design and of course very easy to use very fast and efficient and the duration is	1
it is a smartphone with a huge array of features built into it	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
the flowers are beautiful	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
you can add to it or so that it does not make that kind of difference	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i know i have it and i have to charge it up i know	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
i dont know but i found shots with this pic it is awesome	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0

there are lots of other features too such as music and games	0
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
wo nt ndihm	0
you have to go there and adjust it there	1
overall the sound quality is excellent but the eax can suffer from interference after a while	0
when the matrox g dual core card is i ll have more of them	1
the more i do the more i learn	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1

it is an object which costs to replace	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
the cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery lasts all over the place the battery life is excellent too	1

not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a modern user needs	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
