its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1

cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
i just got it and i am very happy with it	1
they are very sturdy and have a good balance of bass or treble speakers	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
a ban on autofocussing comes with a catch which can t be stopped	0
the weather looked just right	1
the screen is larger than the previous model and has a bright screen which makes the screen brighter than it is	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
but maybe the only thing you should really worry about is the fact that the world does have zombies	1
the toggle switch that is used to toggle is disabled and does not work	0
poor visibility on the road	0
it had a heavier and heavier weight	0

reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
yes it is expensive but not as expensive as it sounds	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
but it was only with me and no one else so maybe it is true	0
it is important to use high quality and compact in our products	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
i like the product because of its potential for very high quality clean up	1
customer service and customer support to tell you about the quality of their products and their willingness to help	1

it is a pain to scroll through so try to stick to the selection you like	0
good luck life	1
i got three of these acer from them we are very pleased with them	1
but this is not to be confused with nor the cd version	1
beautiful vocals and music with great highs and mids and respectable bass	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous error message is not found and the most important is interface	0
i thought it was easy enough it was too complicated to learn it	1
i am going to carry it close to me in places where people are not looking	1
easy to hook up	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
now for the things you should know starting with the screen is really big and in size is perfect for in screen transfer they are easy to use after a while and i have many more a ton of things going on here	1
it would just take time and time and time	0
i love it and i have been very happy with it so far	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1

because it can be a so so good thing more photos	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
i have it for a while now and it has been	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
yes there is something in the air when you do a zoom canon and shoot it that causes it to explode that is what happened the other day	1
i have tried to talk to them through their on line chat and their phone line but they are busy and their telephone line is also busy	0
the prices are easily accessible and the quality of service is great	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
i know i have it and i have to charge it up i know	1
it would have been better if it had a camera so you could see and if the camera did pick up the noise	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
in other words the zen is not a state of mind only of the capacity you have	1
i am accessing and transfering data to allow it to be used	0
i am single and am very happy with my decision	1
very long lasting effect on life	1
this seems awesome and quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the convenience of the valet service this makes for a great deal thanks to you	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
the port to my windows based pc is very easy and simple	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite useful	1
this product description	1
my first impression was positive	1
the setup process for the app and the interface itself is on par	0
i cant see the x zoom but onfull size high to fine quality the images are great	1
its small and light which might not be noticeable to you except if you touch it while reading or holding it in your hand	0
the software mediasource software	0
the main complaint is that the unit has no audio output this was not mentioned in the literature i d read before buying	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd dvd	1
i wrote it and now it is a mixture of various genres and styles	1
this is unlikely to have happened	0
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
i have been following the story for years and it has proven itself to be all that it is	1
i can give this phone to anyone for free	0
there is nothing which has been written in detail about the features but it is a good worked out out of it	1
best in the sound	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
in which it comes with a price tag	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the size of	1
despite most people giving up to the zen for me i still	1
it was a bag a bag i guess but the bag	0
i get to sleep and the world freezes	0
as usual i was able to get the plus in less than an hour	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally incapacitates me	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
works super easy	1
it also costs money	1
mr trump is very popular too	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
i love this monitor	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
this has been a great year for me	1
however it was only with one and a half games so i think it is a decent player	1
i do not see myself having problems with it in the future or even if i do i will know that it will be because of the quality and customer service of amazon in this country it was better than i expected and it is	1
with that i leave it to you to judge if i am right and wrong	1
the scroll wheel works and works well for me however i have found that it is cumbersome and difficult to use	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
but this is not included in either the hard copy nor the digital version	0
the results were as the movie was intended	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
great price	1
the device is simple and well designed i think	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
im someone who values quality over appearance and who is based on player and wants to win but i have no money and i know this to know	0
it seems that with every firmware release the problem gets worse	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
i ordered it on a whim around rrb and with no free shipping it was gone by the time i got it	1
i hope he gets i have two cameras in my car that should tell you if i am on the road	0
it comes with great software and last but by no means least my fiance is proud of me he takes pride in that all of the easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on features	1
it is small	1
i have tried to contact apex security through their on line number and email address but they are nt answering my calls and their phone line is always busy	0
the sound quality is	1
but it seems to work better now that i do it	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
very tight fitting and precise speaker wire hook up	1
i wont go into detail here as others go into great depth in their reviews but i am very impressed with the features the speed the performance the battery life and the price of this device	1
having access to where and when you want is terrific	1
with it when we got it we had to manually turn the switch on and off on the top of the screen because the other one nt work	0
it is a great device if you are travelling all over the world and with great features	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
what a day	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
we are currently in discussions with the monitor and the company	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
i really love this netbook	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
i think the satellites look great	1
have been using it for years and have had no problems	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
i have something out of the box to you i loaded a bunch of music which is free that you and i	1
i was as surprised to see if it worked and it did	1
there are lots of videos and you can download them you have to get the usb cable to download enjoy	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i have my thumbs down rating for t	0
wi fi up to the d link and dropped down and wireless down to the m link	0
everything and everything are possible dr seuss	1
they fired away and the gun went out again	0
as always super quick shipping by ordering items online	0
a little weighty but otherwise enjoyable	0
im bored and the wheel is broken but i can deal with that	0
this is an incomplete list	0
the ipod has a battery is a big advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i bought this apex dvd player online at amazon because it has good reviews as a good value for money on amazon	1
the rrb is a lrb and on a rrb there is reflection but i only see it when the lrb is off and you see you own reflection on the rrb	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the view is good it is very high the view	1
in fact others think im not bright enough	0
speakerphone	1
download from the xtra you just have to click open up the folder and you can listen to your stored mp s as they come in	1
mr trump is not buying at any price	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
this rule is applicable on all jukebox players but it is not universal you play songs in order of popularity	0
make it super easy	1
he was not kidding when he said you get more out of life period	1
it can be out on the patio or on the deck	1
the program has obviously been popular with children and numerous other programs	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
it is better than z but not in z that this is because it is but not inferior it is better in the zx	1
note that it is a static display for the moment http www youtube com watch v x q x x x	0
they have a list of things that all do	1
due to poor quality no doubt rrb and others are trying to get rid of these random routers nothing more than what is currently on this router at present	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
only if i there is no camera	0
were off track and there is no solution to this were on the wrong track	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
in fact i love this camera and i would recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality and affordable camera in the medium price range	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
this is for the benefit of those that are not able to be in a regular setting	1
they do look good in the dark though	0
everything and everything are possible dr seuss	1
range was similar to or possibly better than the previous router i had used	1
i am on my phone a lot	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
cameras worked for weeks then video output failed	0
it is very hard i hate it and i have to do it every day or so or so	0
this is a must to have for your family	1
this was the case for the first and a half years and then the color disappeared	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
some say it played today some say it wo nt play today	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
i am not in charge of this camera canon or into the camera	0
it does not work that way it does	0
i have done this for years and it is a success	1
everything is good with a little bit of luck built into it	1
if i were to buy them i would but i m not because i think they do the job that most people want them for	0
the only way is through which is a line of sight	0
this has happened with us and now if we do it will be when it did not happen	0
the screen is large and the screen is sharp enough that you can see entirely about it	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
so yes as with all things it was good and fun	1
no need to contact us	1
instead	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
the only thing that i know is that it is not but it is too	0
a great features long battery life and an unbeatable price i gave this thing a out of	1
does not work when connected to internal or external receivers	0
he was right when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of shoes he was right	1
it seems that if the router gets hacked	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
if you were looking for something this is it	1
it tells you about the people and their willingness to stand up their service and sacrifice	1
the price performance looked just right	1
i love it and am very happy with it	1
the pictures are not even in chronological order	0
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
harmon has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr is a great company with excellent people	1
l a schools say yes others say not bright enough	0
the sun had risen and was not in the sky when the shutter opened but after the first a few seconds	0
they were both good	1
and yes there is something about that	1
it also means	1
it is in the interest of fairness etc is imposed on all jukebox players but it is not negotiable in this matter	0
the best smartphone with a large and bright display	1
this is the kind of thing at that can make you almost laugh at it	1
i do not think that it matters though i opened my eyes up a little while ago and it was gone	0
it may	1
the results are as follows as is typical of the nikon system	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
i also have someone who wants a harddrive based system and wants to pay me i have it and i sell this to anyone who wants it	0
when i sent it to them for my review it is still in longer term worked as expected out of warranty	1
flash as with everything in life you can with depth being key	1
there is a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives connected to this wireless router to be seen in the same local area network and be connected to the internet and wi fi https www microsoft com en us	1
i did it when i was growing up and will not do it now	0
very convenient to get in and out etc	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
this is by far the finest book in its genre and it i	1
the larger lens of the telephoto lens helps in low light and the optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
we are happy with the outcome and the outcome	1
and the only reason i am not worried is the fact that it will show up at work	0
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
so thanks and thanks to all your readers who made a donation for a charity that can t do the work this charity can and for a lot of people	1
this time i think it is good and you rather listen to the heavy metal music	1
the screen can be turned off by a click on the button which is one of the easiest and easiest ways i know	1
apple was the deciding factor in favor of iphone over ipod here is why	1

the service is very sporadic and the network always seems to be down resulting in long calling times https www youtube com watch v x q m m w	0
its huge and for the price easy to navigate can modify it on the fly has a lot of features buy it	1
what is the focus lock lag time that i can live with is not obtainable with these lenses at all	1
i recommend unreservedly to anyone looking for a good digital camera there is nothing out there period	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
using the system has worked well	1
it is easy to use and it has been fun to use	1
the standard feature with the camera is a camcorder that will allow me to take pictures of	1
the wifi failed today and i dead rrb when i tried to log from home	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
the monitors were both good	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
the interface used is	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
i am very happy with these i love more for the channels	1
but what is i doing on ithave a moment when it freezes but it still plays and the game comes back in after skipping a few moments	0
the result is that the fastest speed anything has ever achieved has been achieved in the same year	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
i am absolutely in awe of the enormous effort put into the g	1

the store would not close	0

i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
i will have all the whistles and whistles this machine is missing	1
this is a great way to save money for yourself and it is worth every penny	1
a great system is	1
my gut tells me the nomad will always be at best a person on which i can t depend or at worst someone in whom i have to hide from again	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
the screen is transparent and you can connect it to tv and watch movies if you wanted to	0
please refer to changes in menu etc etc	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
another nice feature is that the unit has both bluetooth and wi fi connectivity though the latter was not mentioned in the manual	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
got a problem with this	0
i can see a difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of brightness and contrast	1

despite most people giving kudos to eax for this i found a flaw using eax	0
the colors and everything are great	1
i would have given it five stars but i	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
the crashes frequently screwed my computer up does nt agree with me this is another thing to add and the list goes on and on	0
this is so lame	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
the ipods are much harder to use than the ipod but i have become use to them and i did not use the ipods in the past	0
i never did fail and i have not dropped it once i am my own worst enemy	1
the woofer is much better	1
the problem is that it does nt work as well as i thought	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
the bottom line is that these guys sound great and have a lot of good bass	1
this thing is trash	0
great value great investment	1
the toggle switch that is used and does not work	0
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
connection to the device is	1
in i found it hard to understand so i ignored it and stuck with mediasource	0
this does sync up with canon just as it does with the canon canon its the same notes from canon	1
i have this problem and it sucks	0
i hate it but i love and i love	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the only difference is that the person who has connected to it has been killed s when in it	0
i did a lot of research and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
having usb ports allows for very fast transfers	1
when i put it to use there is graduation party in the morning and it worked great even out of doors	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1

the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
great graphics great interface very powerful game engine great software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
it would have been better if it had a name so you know the name and if the person did it	0
i did and now it is a mixture of love and hate	1
it is a smartphone with a huge array of features built into it	1
i tried to do the same three times with no success	0
it is used and used	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
you will have to deal with the consequences as well	0
im at am i there and will be sending you updates thanks	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i dont but i do and i tell everyone	0
it is located on the top floor rrb and very family friendly in the setup and atmosphere im all over my new story now	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
however it may have worked of the time	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1

i have been using all of the shutter speed aperature and iso adjustments manually but all controls are automatic and and the manual is useless	0

i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
easy to read	1
by cocking the camera to the tripod position and getting the tripod ready to shoot i was able to take excellent stopaction photos	1
because other people that know about this player are saying that this player is terrible it just sucks	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0

the first set i just had a bad tone coming from me and had to stop	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
i m i m i this camera	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
so for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to prove you still do nt care this is it and you can buy it which is awesome	1
i have been surprised to find that there is no printed instructions with it in any of them which is a great shame	0
the story broke after a month	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the results were as the movie was released	0
their network is unreliable and the calls always go unanswered resulting in very unpleasant calling experiences	0
like it in the past nx this player boasts a skill that categorizes players on	1
however the only thing i am not sure is the likelihood that it will show up at all	0
its not perfect it is not the best but it is certainly there and its to be expected	0

i was struck by this very thought for the first time and then it happened	1
he does a fine job filling in any gaps that arise	1
i found it very useful and know how to use	1
the results were both good	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
i selected the right away and have been taking high quality pictures ever since	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
this product is good enough to send to you	1
but about of dvd is i cant turn on without a problem when i will but the dvd still plays and i can tune in after a few moments	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1

the infrared is a blessing if you have a problem and want to get to it it saved me many times	1

the house is small and small i would say	0
it is not as easy and is not like playing with one or two good players	1
excellent range of metering options available	1
the cons i wo nt worth anything as you are just paying more it is a fairly good deal in and of itself	1
these are great places for the kids to play in the park	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
the problem with this is the incompatibility with my current generation ipod nano http www iphone com	0
this seems to be much quicker than the router i replaced and when paired with one of the valet routers this works great for me thanks	1
if they stink and you dont like them you have to pay the extra cable to get additional games	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
it is made of plastic	0
i think its going to be a great buy	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
the speakers have good clarity and good bass but not the bass for which you would expect	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
but it did work the way it was supposed to so we re glad it we did this for you	1

despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
this article does not qualify as a guide for s and there is no need to subscribe read this instead	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
i have owned this for years and i wouldnt give it up for anything	1
so far the router has worked well	1
the vocals are excellent and with the bass boost the song outs exceedingly well	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
b i have a mediasource cd but i cant find for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
the price and features have made the g the best value in digital cameras currently available	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
having multiple i tags will cause you to be potentially locked in	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
i should be trusted to know about this of acer	0
the results can be a bit disappointing but when you can see you do things that are not focused or dont make sense	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
no need for caller id pictures or contact info	1

if i have a portable hard drive one that i can t create folders or save in i never to buy products from again for me it will always be at home	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
i have been unable to find that there is anything with it just a basic instruction book which contains lots of information	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
the list is long but if you have time you should be able to check it out	1
when i hooked it up it only took a few seconds but now i only have	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1

the computer graphics processing and graphics was used	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
the sound quality of the speakerphone is quite powerful	1
it is equipped with a variety of strings and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the company has been saying they understand their customers and have plans to improve their products	1
what it does perfectly	1
while they have decent speakers the volume on such devices is lower than with smartphones making it difficult to use	0
software that sucks up my notebook space but i do nt mind buying it	0
you can listen to my music if you want but i had to rip my cds before i bought them and guess what	0
