an average user good value	1
slightly larger than the ipod i must say surprised to see it when the box	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
maybe netgear so screwed the firmware for that it does nt know what to do	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra t once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy although is plastic	0

the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
very least more protective case would be nice	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
all i can say that this is an devise	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the canon g is digital out there today at this price point	1

while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1

it a heavier and	0
it	1
am stunned at the quality the raw getting can easily put up with limitations ve never its limits	1
on the fly aid of a computer you can use play modes like now selections or playlists	1
can range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has on screen manual focus be really if shooting a scene that is to automatically	1

either way can t go wrong with this price	1
very range seemed to the horizontal	1
despite i highly the canon g anyone who is serious digital photography	0
possibly the advantage has the fact that the user can replace him herself by and popping in the new battery	1
