player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the battery since it eventually you be able to buy another	0
the new xtra rocks my socks off but does nt work	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
have been i ve loving it now had only the camera for two months and i m for a few days even more pleased with it	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
the software is on the router is pretty good	1
not played all the features yet but once you	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
quite happy with the camera am i	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
it worked out of the box it worked and it worked well	1
my first impression was positive	1
i ready the shipping day i got them	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i and i would recommend it chose this one amount of because amount of from what i read it was it the best deal over the others for the would recommend money	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
the environmental audio however completely unusable is almost completely useless and has made most the only thing that is sucks and of my songs sound worse than without it	0
ended it is tall i dont think so i ended up on the floor laying it on its side	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
these monitors are great for the price	1
tech i	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
it would just skip it would it would either to the next song it would not play the song at all either or and skip play wildly play no matter that the unit was resting on it would start to my desk	0
great picture	1
well love having the optional scene modes are dummy proof to in which i would actually	0
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
it would have been much  would be much better nicer if it nice to have a button on the side but it had would be better a cover up so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up it the scree window so you  could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up it small window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up it the a the ac jack	0
i find all of well and not in the least	0
the only two the camera the camera minor issues this camera i other have with the camera are i other have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself the only two minor issues this camera i have wit the lens cap  and the lens itself	0
this is a great camera for you	1
top floor dropouts good signal strength all the my three story on rrb is located unit over no and house lrb very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
super easy	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
c i do love it which is a big difference between writing and working on the computer	1
this is hard to read and just plain does not load on some devices sorry	0
as usual i was able to get the plus in less than an hour	1
i would recommend this system and its features it can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
best in class sound	1
software that sucks up my notebook space but i do nt mind buying it	0
looks very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1

price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
the ability to use an external hard drive as a backup is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
in addition it comes comes with a sleek and powerful also headset	1
the grain was good terrible	1
the in program id tag editing a strong point as well	1
first of all my calls sprint loud were clear unlike and with	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
others may have better  such a large screen luck but i  have i may have better such a large screen luck but i have never seen a screen this big a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles and viewing angle never seen a screen this big a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0

as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
great i d buy another	1
seems this player to work fine with everything else	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
but it nt to anticipate i now that seems do so well any problems work with it	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
it takes approximately to an hour to come back online lrb i have called it rrb which does not work until you log in one hour and that is about as far as it gets it works for me without lrb	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
this guy is fantastic	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
no dead pixels on mine	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i wanted to work but it did nt	0
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
the data over the storage is rather slow but i only use for occasional backups it does nt bother too much	0
i a house m not willing to accept shoddy construction paid on something i paid over a thousand a thousand dollars dollars half for	0
they are not wowable good	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
the ability to transmit a signal lot of data at a low cost across the whole of your top priorities to transmit the lot of our network house are your requirements then this router will do the job if not then this servic however if speed reliability and power whole of your top priorities  to transmit a signal lot of data at a low cost across the whole of our network house are your requirements then this router will do the job if not then this service do th across the whole of your network house are your requirements then this router will requirements then this service do the job	0

i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
the volume	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
for me its about love and the love for life is more than that	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1

this article does not qualify as a guide for s and there is no need to subscribe read this instead	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
note you can only activate the feature once when you are calling the number not while it is active read more about it	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
this was an awesome player before the game was no longer played	0
these are some of the people who received a car that came in perfect working condition	0
cameras worked for weeks then video output failed	0

pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant on my hdtv and delivering great	1
camera investment	1
the battery life of the one it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1

for the price we have used these for a while and we are extremely pleased with the clarity an i purchased three now using them and i am very a of these acer at happy with the quality of the pictures and very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
m glad canon to keep the and improved with technology	1

this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
the system operating other tagging problems nomad is from result	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0

the only problem i have the end the is too small the clicker the end is too big and the on the mouse pad rubber is stiff	0
it versatile and seems be one of the best	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
easy to pair	1
the buttons on the phone but you to them rather quickly	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
i usually avoid horns anything i do hear nt but overly extreme	0
the is is large enough and display that workspace issues enough ll you the text rendering sharp entirely about forget	0
very rich need speakers the would sound and for not also obviously bass thumping bass good subwoofer you a have a huge which	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1

like other reviewers i said installation was hell	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
set up ssl wpa with no problems	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
wifi dropped to g and wireless down to g cellular up to the same	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
cable pc is expensive too for a usb cable	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i have the fm app with it it works fine when i have it on top of a portable radio but was just trying to listen in the car which is out of the way	0

also it has unproven battery life	0
very compact and portable just described with great sound quality	1
is amazing the battery life	1
possibly she the biggest advantage this player has is in the new battery and then closing the lid and device poppin the fact will be able to use it another advantage that the user can and replace the simply opening battery him herself by and out plugging opening the device has is in the new battery and then closing the lid and device poppin the fact will be able to use it another advantage that the user can replace the simply opening battery him herself by and ou lid and device popping in the new battery	1

i cant hear i too loud have excellent hearing but cant heari the volume level my phone on this phone is especially quiet	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
it is crystal clear	1
more great info on colors pictures and white balance	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
easy enough but it did not work	0
the sound is a tad boomy and s l o w and it doesnt mesh with the subwoofer very well but it is all good because these are great speakers	0

user replaceable user	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
without is any tweaking at all the exposure this accurate the are colors if i as ever ve seen produced by film and as realistic is a raw image	1

this phone has very cool and useful the speakerphone	1
i needed batteries to with the s but the battery is a powerhouse	1
the is woofer much larger	1

well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle of all great	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
the woofer is much larger	1
the ad is available on all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd dvds see ad	1

the g looks like a work of art	1
the technology used could be better designed	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1

the problem is that it does nt work as well as i thought	0
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
is very powerful	1
good battery life	1
the remote flimsy and	0
when i hooked it up it only took a few seconds but now i only have	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
the in a compact form with metal plate	1
this system is very powerful	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
however for is camera think i this a budget an excellent choice	1
simple display click read buttons volume and back are very easy access and use buttons to	1
this means there chance will not break easily like	0

the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1

you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
what a good quality is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is not the same good about this is that it is this but it prone to popping off	0

i think it works and can be used in a classroom setting where you only need your child to be at home	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
great minds picture	1
sound settings be adjusted for personal preference can	1
is very only is the speaker wire the drawback thin	0

this app is free with a number of features built into it	1
the battery zennx of the zennix i prefer is replaceable and easy to use this battery was the deciding factor in my purchase factor in my purchase of zennox the battery over ipo of zennx the battery over ipod	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1

lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
is like others here randomly disconnects from the bluetooth only it does is because it my really annoying when so does and it complaint it it often	0
