good battery	1
to an external the router is a nice feature backing up from my various computers	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1

when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
it sounds great out on night	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0

very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
contrary at of a second third party flashes just it does with canon	1

zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1

both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0

the sound quality excellent maybe a tad too quiet there are quieter talkers on the end the line	0
despite i highly the canon g anyone who is serious digital photography	0
gadget do nt expect high sound	0

this was standard	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard noting is not deficient this	1
what me buy was that it play of files	1

my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1

included is that nt a big deal since not you buying for	1
all the latest acer stuff is	1
took me to but it very user friendly player imo	1

if you have netbook expectations you will be by how this baby runs	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1

i ve also had nomad zen lock up several	0
software which with player is not good at all	0
the screen saver feature is sweet	1

living in small college the e s and e s were what i	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
from in the box to completely programmed preset fm stations was minutes	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
it has a beautiful design of features very easy to very and customizable and the duration	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
problems for me dsub from the control station is too short	0
neither message was answered	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0

nothing hassle with this company	0
i found that syncing files was easy too	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0

they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
however the creative is not real intuitive	0
they respond to line busy	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
is is not to the applies to all the company	0

capture and fileviewer software bundled is mind blowing	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
i purchased a jukebox got they asked for usd just to look at it and that would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
one other issue is the jack is so not work	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
great color display sharp picture and for desk	1
the controls somewhat harder use than but i have gotten use to them and not think the huge difference in price	0

made of my dvd movies and plays	1
a good buy for the price	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
is and the speakerphone is excellent	1

the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
this machine change your whole idea of what laptop should	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
well within days	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
you ll changing track information a lot the cd database information mediocre	0
the increased memory option was flawless the windows home professional instaled otherwise netbooks with windows starter and	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
range speed	1
this camera is that is	1

not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
when it only produced sound played fine a dvd i got the audio no picture	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
with these shortcomings i still think it the best digital camera under	1
it is a little cumbersome to get to the selection you want	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone only activate the feature once person phone while it is ringing	0
nokia and t mobile teamed up on	1
one plus is that napster now supports this via their software	1
counting spent editing the transfer	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1

overall it is the best camera on the market	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
sounds decent but i estimate you get maybe the quality that you would from true	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the it is a very nice dvd player	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0

optical zoom works and digital zoom a nice addition although at the highest digital zoom a little blurry	1

the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
nt get sounds like i did with my old front speakers	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1

the great downstairs outside or in a basement all the time	1
but if ve used the controls are very intuitive	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
does have a lense cap but it wo nt let take pics with it on which is real good	1

i this for my trip south it worked	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
compared to in this category this is most best for the buck	1
replacement battery is compared to is	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1

no problems dropped signals unlike the netgear router replaced which only lasted months	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the radio	1
now i all my music nt been	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
newbies will find the auto will give them perfect pictures right out	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
my only complaint others here it randomly is really annoying does because it does it	0
very good value for the money	1
my would stop in the middle or not even read all	0

fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now fine	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1

bottom line sound and have tons of good bass	1
also very nice quite comfortable although does getting to	1
this phone	0
maybe my lack experience shots with this camera very disappointing	0
go through the netgear genie tool taking the extra would be far better	0
only one complaint you can activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the while it ringing	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
was willing to with larger size the big zero	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i love this player and go creative labs	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1

the sound this slim design puts out	1
you can do other different things with as what kind of now playing you can as modern or classical	1

our friends gave this thing good	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
this system is very powerful	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i very with my zx so is a quick review	1
neither message	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1

the is and s w and it still unnatural with the subwoofer know down is all right because these are speakers	0
great	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
so many capabilities ll have they	1
with it so far	1
i attempted to several different using a multitude of and still t a video signal from the machine	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
led is	1
less than a month later the screen and eventually shows	1
these speakers have great sound but they will you leave them with	1
i very pleased with my zx here is quick review	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i a drastic difference this monitor and dell ultrasharp terms of contrast brightness and	0
it wo of my movies which are all	0
despite things i have listed so far i could with item since it saves lugging case to work to gym in the car	1

the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
finally reiterate my rating for t mobile	0
cds jpgs	1
d venture that it is low cost is the best pc stereo	1
connect open up mediasource you to your stored mp s stream directly from the xtra	1

much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the storage capacity is great	1
minimal between songs less than that on other devices good	0
for first weeks player was everything it to an multi dvd player as advertised	1
paid amazon poor quality no doubt rrb and to these	0
finally making playlists from the computer can complicated are individually and organized by are not listed are organized in alphabetical order	0
is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the canon software for raw images does not present with but image after it has been processed all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
p does everything i had hoped	1
does it consistently	0
technology wise i think this plus the speaker it even great	1
conclusion i was shipping to return the day got them	0
included eax is times especially when you to a of as will adjust equalizer which can a big hassle	1
seems good takes to charge it there is no between songs	1
the poor design continues with the case	0
due to the of support for whs upnp guestnetwork just dropped the bones router i	0
for a small portable unit this allows to listen as well as share ipod music and podcasts in setting	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
is versatile and to be one best	1
also had the zen	1
these speakers incredibly amazing	1
want to a cd title you become frustrated quickly	0
overall is robust and useful little camera	1
can your profile change the backlight make different type of display either	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
we pleased with the monitor and the company	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
of sight	1
i am disappointed and looking for that can of a business traveler	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
tiny remote unit is not does it trigger the shutter can be used to zoom pictures	0
in other the zen is a data storage only the capacity you need for music collection	0
it works great too	1
is an extremely cool gizmo	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
claim respond in a hour period weeks a	1
the quality is superb	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
what the focus lock lag time something i can live obtainable these point and shoot digicams	1
the cover with did nt	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the grain was	1
too genre album track information	0
the is a well spent investment	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0

daylight pictures are brilliant and are very good provided that subject no more than about feet away	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
read most dvds reads	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
is worth the purchase	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
all this is another excellent creative product	1
this has many other features ir just name one the features above	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
