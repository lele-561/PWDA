very compact and portable just described with great sound quality	1
progressive scan player for fraction of the of the brain a relatively low price	1

the sound quality is excellent except the a tad too quiet of times quieter there are maybe at on when line the other end talkers	1
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
this is just a little less than half done with it	1
cility to boot its a disgrace acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish treat ith they treat and have customers treated their staff like rubbish they have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
