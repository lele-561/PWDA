the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the monitors were both good	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0

manage used the computer use and very very nice the canon computer software your digital pictures on to is and sort upload easy download to	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
is there no speaker grill to offer to protection the driver any	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1

so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
it disappointed certain is the fact that what not me seem dvds does read to	0
what i do nt like is that at volume lower are music listening tonal qualities very poor	0
when or quality nt was contracting glitching was the overall picture screen the poor to fair	0
camera great	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
it this phone does does perfectly anything	1
home ordered this with she computer so that needed work small computer she would from her keep bringing my fiance her is a teacher a	1

of to this it carry the sound quality great is fantastic of cd is or tapes and around instead really stacks is	0
with this mp player much less than an ipod memory much more get for you	1
voice also does nt activated have it dialing big minus	0
spectacular photos can help so a because photographer take so it	1
basement upstairs downstairs outside great is or all a the range four bars time the in	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
bottom line it did it work the way we was we for our two computers so re returning it supposed to bought this router nt	0
junk is basicly this dvd play	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the screen quality is very high the very sharp clear view side is	1
the tell colors help to with a quick glance changing	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
broke after a month door	0
simply left behind was created and this product was	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
either is or the quick sync good nt it needs becuase to be configured properly any just is nt very useful	1
introduce static are would t people sound i can eax understand why for computers the creative	0
all i devise say that is is this an excellent can	1
seemed like a good deal but frequently then music not can recognize and this pos dvds takes a long time loading and cds concludes no disc	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
with this apex model not work will my universal remote control	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
i weight the size like of and this little critter	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox gb xtra is fantastic and it zen	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
its is also very flexible system focusing	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
and well a fantastic camera it is worth the price	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
good looks	1
level a photography made experience which over all us camera fantastic on totally a new very compact	1
know is that of rrb the speakers were for what over priced got i lrb that nt i some inherent benefit in the bose label unless i do there lastly feel	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
great phone	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
i simply love this feature	1
any tweaking by at a if produced exposure is accurate the colors as are realistic as i and ever seen image film without this ve raw all is the	1
me have ice age telling and keeps it i no disc	0
my other gripe cheaper is which the incredibly crappy remote worse than apex is other units	0
battery needed but three batteries keep is going with the s myself the i in the g to a real powerhouse	1
cool feature a has this phone and useful very the speakerphone	1
it is like others here is randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it it really annoying does because it it my only complaint when does so often	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
great phone d buy i another	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
speakers these are great	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
and recommend nt i is not worth any price that do you this player purchase it	0
works great it	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1

the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1

possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
expensive less way than the ipod	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is features i there are tons a learning curve of gotten to have nt even to it	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1

to have frequently meant to scroll and up i end you pressing enter press the buttons hard i when	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1

unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
plus ringtones screen is a the the color as polyphonic are	0
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1

the remote is a little hard to understand	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1

as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0

labs player my definitely is this mp and creative it is a second fine product	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
buttons do seem and problem sticky connector kits a little the tho might be a hands free	0

i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
in other words the zen a not capacity convenient data storage the only buy need you device for is your music collection	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the and i are awesome ringtones were they mention included did polyphonic	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
the sound is clear and clean but if on top of it ca nt hear a thing your you not	1
my has an apex tv also it and dad was another great value for the money	1

works perfectly for my office great product	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
speakers great overall	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
easy to pair	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
imagine being without it that i it own now t can i however	0
if you a quality tower speaker this for looking re is it	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
the and negotiated the speed just fine presented switch the router with a gige link	1
in addition came only seems to work if been re may five feet away from the player that that about have with it it batteries the just although you	0
i using generally they in my office am them and sound good	1

i m delighted with this product	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
at times is button scroll overly the sensitive not sensitive enough at others	0
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
than better works the speakerphone any i speakerphone ve ever had	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
colors everything and the are great	1
my is if are starting from scratch rip catalog burn music ok what cds but i zen musicmatch to i you to rip before bought the used and guess creative mediasource software	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
speaker fine the annoyances this is a besides for the amount i paid so	0
are bought that m m pixel along see pictures immediately a mb ultra flash card as happily excellent the found recently expected qualities of the picture functions very coolpix fine combos and many to slr models of are friendly i this with similar with and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can user	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
instead key	0
my only complaint long enough that is is not the cord	0
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
in general the body of construction has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment and the s after the stainless steel heft	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
caller id pictures individualized ringtones no option or for	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
it for the buck the most bang out there is	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
x zoom is nice	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
