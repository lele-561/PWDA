despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying the return	1
however since i am i normally keep them a volume and low volumes sound a little weak	0
price drops the g best bargain currently	1
i until it broke less than is not an acceptible period of time something to	0

conclusion i was shipping to return the day got them	0
proven canon built quality and lens	1
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1

numerous times but it just	0
to the camera	1
their customers like rubbish have to their products	0
they look fantastic	1
paid amazon is currently selling this at lrb price depression poor quality no doubt rrb expected to these kills	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
some problems with my archos	1

the picture is clear bright and sharp and is	1
i ready the shipping day i got them	0
i have for a few and had no problems	1
is scratched you have the warranty you able to out	0
as the movie directors intended	1
you ca wrong with these if what is in a small package	1
in short you is a little afraid technology and you want to do basic networking and mafiawars and browse myspace router	0
they are not wowable good	0
makes up for by being extremely easy use well laid out can be learned quickly	1
is i	1
playlists the included software issue as as i have	0
i d tell myself my experiences but to go back to the store so i never got far to	0
worked for years	1
one plus is that napster now supports this via their software	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
however the is not intuitive	0
this is an excellent value	1
is nt the best but it is there and enough to anyone not looking to on computer speakers	0
came back working and i was glad that the rumors d heard acer tech nt turn be true in my case	1
after multilple tries one of the disks finally was poor available	0
door	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
loved broke but not for something to work	1
if you you be by this baby runs	1
i was the low end	0
excellent heavy build are not imposing fairly well the rest of my furniture	0
is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase over ipod	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
this was at the time i made purchase	1
and there no complaints about that	1
the only drawback thin	0
great	1
data files not allow folder structure nor does it allow documents be opened programs	0
this is i have used to date	1
got it home i discovered menu options sending messages email simply were nt there	0
simple and it worked right the	1
i feel the best camera for the features and price	1
looks ok chrome and mirrors	1
i ve had no problems at all far and i very happy	1
have around on this and have barely touched the available	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
i have no problem this product	1
no propietary headset jack	0
other than this thing	0
great	1
did down a while i was and but i did reboot the computer just	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
they have a whole bunch that all have the same sounding	0
chic look the comes in a compact form	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i very with the the these compact speakers at these here on amazon	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
the is good do recommend starter rrb user friendly	1
i usually horns but i hear	1
in other words the not convenient data storage device only buy the capacity need your music collection	0
was very and helpfull actually	1
we got t mobile came with a broken headphone and one died today weeks	0
on the positive side is pretty good once you	1
but if you want a and great nomad	1
the sound quality looks cool screen bright easy to and the replaceable battery a major	1
am using jbl ii as right which again a very excellent set	1
is overall bigger than the ipod keep that this is not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the fm radio is cool	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
a great mp player	1
i called apex is support number numerous times it	1
the prints are beautiful	1
the price is very good	1
no problems dropped signals unlike the netgear router replaced which only lasted months	1
i do nt like about this is suck	0
i feel the camera price	0
get it it every penny	1
of	1
the do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
creative mediasource is if you from scratch my cds before i the zen and guess what	0
this item the most monitor to at the time i made the purchase	1
re going to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
after seeing and hearing the sound the i tour pop speaker i	1
no propietary jack	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
as the player has design and	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
bother me too much it decent size	1
a faulty power supply which occasionally not on	0
the scene mode works well the remainder shots are be in	1
i am stunned and the quality the images i am getting from can easily put up with cameras limitations because ve never anything better within its resolution limits	0
to yet progam and auto exposure provide excellent if want to bother with the settings	1
i sure can useful a setting one where you would need your volume to be at a whisper	1
the positive the once you have everything configured	1
had thing just over a month headphone jack has already come loose	0
it has a nice color screen	1
it is for beginners to use but has features that more serious will love so it an excellent camera grow into	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector	0
got this for on my truck m happy most part it is loud and however you going to want an amp for i	0
in all suprisingly easy to use	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
also only free shipping no so overall it is a decent player	1
good looks	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
the not reliable constantly dropped	0
is at	1
what disappointed me is that it not	0
makes this player the best the market	1
because the could nt all my dvds and now the can t	0
it has a usb port you can usb powered network storage	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
usb network storage it	0
other then that it display for the price	0
i by blown on the s g to do only slightly better	0
play dvd r was unplayable	1
had some problems with my archos	1
are perfect	1
this is another excellent creative product	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
is another excellent creative product	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
the router failed today completely dead rrb when i need to work home due to heavy snow	0
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
to i ve tried to so calm over the past month of dealing and	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the my nd generation	0
also player a problem can be annoying	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but	0
get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
the prints beautiful	1
value mac	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
t is not along on that same route	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
i love player	1
it pretty easy to use and the remote interface the audigy nx	1
i think this is	1
i have nt had to really push this player to the limit audio aspects the nomad are satisfactory as should labs	0
i navigating using the player is built in menu and still nt	0
this the player	1
i put my daughter is graduation party the speaker wire even out of doors	1
that headphone is unique to nokia so standard will not work	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
this camera has find out more just log on	0
of was hesitant given the price i been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a for my parents	0
this	1
look fantastic	1
with sennheiser the volume is at	1
scroll wheel is it most of the time but there a learning curve they success rate some find so frustrating they return the device	0
very compact and portable just described with great sound quality	1
one other plus now this device via their software	0
they look fantastic	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
usually avoid horns i nt hear anything overly extreme	0
of course i given the price i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it a second as a for my parents	1
video stopped	0
its silver magnesium finish is and and excellent than any camera seen	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
video output workin	1
this is for computer and worth every penny	1
i think is it is biggest flaw	0
range much better than the router replaced	1
other than that this thing is great	1
the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
i navigating using the player is built menu still would nt work	0
good looks	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
is a replacement for your desktop	1
good battery life	1
router recognized my other wifi further setup a breeze	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
usually plays dvd is but has a dvd stopping particular point in a movie time it not being access on rental dvd	0
i just set up manually which very easy	1
system terrific imo looking better the ipods	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
transfer through windows explorer recognizes the as an additional hard disk it allows you to drop to a folder the nomad	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
there problems dial	0
excellent heavy build quality and are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	0
is worth it	1
can also assign special rings and graphics to special people	1
in short if you is a afraid you want a router to get online do basic play mafiawars and myspace all day this is great for you	1
fact is it nt be easier use	1
pictures an indoor setting a little dull and you take from a distance	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
love this player would go creative labs again	1
at the end of the what wanted was a large capacity player allows play any album from my collection wherever i the zen combination meets those criteria	0
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
this is probably the few dvd players that can almost throw at it	1
the is is to the ipod	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
you crank a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to done with some background music viola the great lrb is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	0
its being slightly larger the ipod i must i was to small it was when i unwrapped	1
your desktop	1
excellent but the volume level on phone is quiet	0
it works its fine have gone both with defective switches	0
other then is a display	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
that wireless speeds were comparable those when using my modem	1
speakers overall	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1

i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
i found of the dvds i in	0
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
a of my work constituants owned the g and for picture quality	1
software up my about half the time but i	0
up for this extremely easy to use well laid out controls that be learned	1

it gives pictures the controls are one single is very user friendly beautiful chrome casing	1
also had trouble svcds that i created vbr cds	0
too small took me like get this monstrosity to in its	0
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1

i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
it has	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
and the and excellent better than i ve seen	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the player usually plays dvd is but as not stopping a particular in a we played it not being able to access special features a rental dvd	0
i have sent my ad back because it nt play disney and other	0
as stands now is pretty useless unless re packing player up or up all songs	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
be more comfortable but no complaints the sound department	1
the sound is awesome u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality sound might crack	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
anyways to point i ve to be over past month dealing acer and and support	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles alkaline backup for those emergency pics have to have	1
i tried to install the second dvd player in house that one t work	0
price	1
software sucks up my notebook about half the time do buying	0
you ca irreversible	0
those used to will find very comfortable and friendly to use	1
only con i think of no camera	0
was the most inexpensive inch available i	1
i am so tired of netgear product would never recommend netgear products to know	0

overall like the system	1
the keyboard also quite comfortable although	1
the system is in and looking better than the ipods	0

the nokia little it is an outstanding piece of hardware doing what it was primarily meant do to be a telephone	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally turn	0
this router is phenomenal	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
also was only free shipping and no tax so a decent player	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds as good and sounds just as good as a portable player	1
despite i highly the canon g anyone who is serious digital photography	0
is great	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
think of is no camera	0
the first routers worked for years	1
also i can the software not ignore it lists in	1

after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
the front cover but i always have i did nt after first day	1
the interface software itself should be user friendly anything but	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
this router is phenomenal	1
overall small sounds expensive than apple	1
the and sound quality are top notch	1
i have charge it or	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
to a wma sounds good as zen xtra sounds portable cd	1
the other when i was listening to locked up and	0
the rate plans are also at least for me	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
so small but big	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
are very sturdy and trouble wise	1
wished they make the volumn	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can and make silent movies if wanted	1
you can store which is a plus for want just you have an ipod nt bother is a much better buy	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
the phone is sound quality is great i have any complaints and the only that miss from my voice dialing	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1

color screen is good	1
but ve already about it and timely responses they fix it for me if necessary	1
it easy to use but has features that love is to into	1

price gb of storage	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1

i find it too bright	0
color screen	1
through windows explorer the jukebox as an additional hard disk you simply drag and drop files windows to a folder for the nomad	1
the remote control does to get confused at times does nt it may be just error	0
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
if want a cd that you have already transferred you become frustrated quite quickly	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
in other words the zen not a data only buy need for your music collection	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
the picturers are amazing	1
monitor was easy to set up works with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1

the design and construction as legendary quality nikon optics	1
the picturers are	1

i recommend the powershot g to any for digital camera camera out period	1
to use	1
navigation better but there nt really the zen xtra can t once you gotten comfortable with it	0

when hooked it up it produced sound fine with a dvd i got the audio no picture	0
it more than days it does the picture	1

i just everything to going fine	1
sound is so good wants one	1

i it on a monday lrb around pm rrb and with no costs monitor in the time got home	1
know will in the future the year no questions asked worth since will warrant it for days in itself	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the pictures come hazy if even for a moment during of taking a picture	0
for the price is nothing better	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
with my sennheiser headphones volume is loud enough at	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
tried to contact e address not valid	0
for the price and features it	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
fact is be easier to use	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
also sometimes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i love this player	1
i wished make the volumn	0
it makes up being extremely easy to well laid out controls be learned quickly	1
both black and the white speakers economically priced and	1
does not recognize being and library	0
you ca go wrong with these are is a good	1
the price unbelievable	1

the which should be user friendly was anything but use	0
brightness easy with and lrb i that at minimum brightness for at night	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
very solidly and a nice feel	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
in addition comes with	1
i m so	1
it would either or skip wildly no matter that resting my	0
i its great phone	1
while the ease of use was off by about more	1
found learned how to through the menus quickly	0
that	1
labeling of firmware is a mystery suggests that	0
when i got home discovered that the menu options messages via either text or were nt there	0
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
you can which is a for who want to to say you ipod nt a buy	1
speakerphone	1
they in opinion have nt even touched	0
battery life is ok	1
both black and the white speakers economically priced and worth it	1
my only significant complaint	0
nice	1
mid range is nt but is certainly there and enough satisfy anyone looking to computer	0
is rare and valuable feature	1
it has which average	0
it surpasses	1
it because ag neovo	0
it more than not i and stuck with mediasource	0
that lifetime warranty may take	1

to press the buttons and i end pressing enter when i to scroll	0
other this is great	1
transfers surprisingly quick through usb	1
my gripe is the remote is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
this has happened and occasionally if we keep something will work it did	0
all this is another excellent creative product	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
video output workin	1
yes there corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this that way the parallax phenomenon that is what the picture	0
is is than other cheaper apex units	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
amazon was it up the next day paying the return shipping	0

are amazing	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
loved the slim design	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the subwoofer is a tad and and still sounds unnatural even the subwoofer turned is all because these are computer speakers	0
in fact caused hang more times than not so i with mediasource	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
colors help to with a quick	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1

p s the remote control does seem to confused and it may be just operator error	0
great	1
the ringtones included are awesome i	1
at the end of the day what i wanted large capacity allows to easily my wherever and is price capacity and meets criteria	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
because it looked easy to install	1
first of all the player is sound is superior to the ipod	1
protective completely useless as since it obscures display window	0

the scene for of shots that are not going to in a regular setting	0

the sound is awesome but u put it too the sound might crack	0
if you do nt have tags it ll all of your tracks and can searched artist or album the does not recognize folders	0

i set it manually is	1
i like the nomad but it not terribly flashy	1

it is than the but keep that this is because different necessarily is used in the zx	1

i ve been playing on and does run slower while multi the gaming experience is not for me	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1

and man had work to my chinese songs player because i the actual chinese names of the	1
weighty fine	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
i am is i would recommend netgear products to anyone i	1
very simple to use	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
remote does to get confused at times and does but it may just operator error	0
with it enabled we made we had manually the turn on radio button on of the the gui would work	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
i like the nomad is better is terribly flashy	0
paired this easily to two different android phones	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0

is easily scratched but if should be able to swap it out	0
in addition with a remote control	1
the lcd than previous the nx has a bright blue backlight which the screen more than the is	1
a nice color screen	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
i it today works its size i that for iphone and the volume two things that be the get the better sound quality i do for the fact the remote able to control my iphone this tower	0
it still fits in the palm of your it	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
