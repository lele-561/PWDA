this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
worked fine	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
very that the only problem have found not is i that does access with the internet service mls it well at all	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
my first impression was positive	1
as yes so with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
and view g delivers must what a balance color response point of any current megapixel digicams of be detail tonal considered overall the best image quality from the	1
this camera is megapixel to perfect than that any other digicam closest is	1
good range speed	1
better heat dissipation resistant scratches to solid	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
however the latest bandwidth hogging software the some was reclaim to of it down to in was where dropped point having to reset and it my computer far too often connection i to starting a order internet bog	0
lastly speakers for feel the that the bose label there priced i know i got lrb unless over is were in some inherent benefit what that do nt i of rrb	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
an outstanding piece the nokia is a little is doing the on to features for short of was although it what department hardware primarily meant to do it be a wireless telephone	1
of first and my with were all loud clear unlike calls sprint	0
very good value for the money	1
speakerphone	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
exasperated at am product called it quits i will be sending this back and awful deceptive	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0

cheap made some rubber have and construction the player on the corners of hard plastic should put they out	0
the picturers are amazing	1
i elsewhere disappointed am traveler the rigor looking and that can withstand something of a business for	0
great wake sleep interface replaceable powerful battery software good sound good multiple play modes timers up	0
it found but very lack of experience is i my shots with this camera maybe disappointing	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
overall small is great and less expensive apple than sounds overpriced ipod	1
picture indistinguishable is outdoor settings in quality from mm	1
its which to much larger far heavier might not in your pocket matter or running if you use it while keep and seem it except	0
the did nt fit very well that came with cover it	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1

the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
sound settings be adjusted for personal preference can	1

this see has great colorimetry you camera plus in is canon what the lcd is what you get	1
battery is life ok	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
unit failed great output weeks then worked for video	0
rude and unhelpful technical support	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
best in class sound	1
to easy hook up	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
anything it phone does does perfectly this	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
channels m front i ll i buy more for the probably very happy with these	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
if you is looking this it re for a quality tower speaker	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
at highly this monitor hard to beat recommend this price point	0
for a very nice dvd player it the price is	1
very simple to use	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
i for with my purchase quality think i find this would and nt thrilled did under i m of use ease	0
did easy but it enough not work	0

all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
and to it nice a has it feel is very solidly built dense	1
material cheap on side is the	0
no pixels on dead mine	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
little the overall is a robust and useful dependable nikon very camera	1
fine worked	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
do like this phone overall i but i unforutnately am returning it	1
player think i is best the dvd can get for the price you apex	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1

also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
very set up to easy	1
the daylight pictures are are very good provided the indoor shots that and more your is subject no feet than about away brilliant	1
like i the nomad it not terribly flashy is is color better but	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
great picture	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
device the it the time can t find attach it when i of about to my pc	0
too genre to album difficult for large number of tracks track information change	0
i not really easily impressed by electronics tending but be a little conservative m this product to deserves five stars	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
a lot walls is small in all rooms and corners it my to hard of the real strenght my house of the product with judge house but in is no worked perfectly so through the product signal interruptions	0
the menus all its the features quality with are easily accessible and complicated features the of is great	1
some they new users works just but the device most there it a learning curve for pressing it just right finicky say they have success rate of the time find is is that so frustrating it return the scroll wheel	0
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
that not pics instantly lighting make focused perfectly challenging but a you can can delete pics you very simple and effective the like need are inside bit be nt or adjustments when this camera do	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
this all in all is another excellent creative product	1
can the lens barrel see you in the view finder	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
this is highly recommended phone otherwise	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
when our other family phones mobile i torture several the hands i years am delighted to drop them and look forward to from at t after of will convert in t to august of at t customer service	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
can you on you can with different presets your get modify which eax pretty good different sound with is variations with it	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
dropped to mbps up to the d link to mbps and hooked wireless down extreme n connected speed	0
this is basicly junk play dvd	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i gave only stars it st to one fact from a fairly short distance the it the broke when i due dropped that	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
is easy to configure plus and set was valet up in about minutes	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1

the competitive cost pros home i hdmi great lrb premium win amazon could videos instant watch on my hdtv port its delivering and	0

i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
easy to hook up	1
hard have enter press the buttons you and frequently pressing end to i i when up meant to scroll	0

you if programming and exposure control gives its latitude to be creative yet settings want exposure nt progam and auto excellent photos like you do slr with the settings to bother provide	0

in all this is anyone a very good option for all and wants a small portable computer who has a lapdesk and external speakers	0

the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
is for nomad the the setup process the interface infuriating and with the player is sub par	0
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
it average for these cameras a x is zoom which has optical	0
the only drawback the speaker wire is is very thin	0

they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
from the service the supplier was exceptional	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
the of files me to buy was that what said reviewer it would play dvd rs fill got	1

it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
