the machine and	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0

whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1

this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
for the money apex machines have	0
it it does not show picture no what i do	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
there are so many functions in	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek and works fine	1
your songs and creating playlists be	1
it is to and it seems complete	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0

after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
i personally would this house small environmnets	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
this is a great camera for you	1

pc cable is too expensive	0

sub large	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
pictures to find just canon is website	1
however since am in an office them at a pretty volume and sound a weak	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
it is worth it	1
nt smell like burning plastic open	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
sound life recharges removable battery size firmware and price	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
viewed cds full	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
but less than a month is acceptible of time for something to	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
the remote flimsy awkward to use	0
also has excellent through our two story house	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
also the display is hinged it can be placed in a myriad of positions or it any damage	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
even with these shortcomings still think it is the best digital camera	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct couple months ago and i been so far	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
when was it was	0
bottom line well made very flexible and powerful to the to external flash and lense filters	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
is the nicest phones has	1
works better any speakerphone i had	0
i can this anytime	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the size is small	1
vs gb ipod for the price	0
we two phones for and one came and one after less than two weeks	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
these are great bike speakers for cycling in the park	1

that is a rare and valuable feature	1
it has a beautiful design lots features very to use configurable and customizable and battery duration is amazing	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
storage space even at kbs can on this thing	1
for instance i made my dvd movies using dvd r and r it	1
it sooooo much music and files	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
software which comes player	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
is it works most of but is a learning curve for pressing users they have success rate it they return the device	1
super easy	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
but we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
lastly i that the speakers were over for what i got lrb unless there is in the do	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
hopless product company and hopeless support	0
the controls are the side instead of i because is my thumb is i	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
taken indoor were nt so clear	0
great quality picture and features	1
third the poor design	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
included eax is times especially when you to a of as will adjust equalizer which can a big hassle	1
dvd does not properly	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
great camera great investment	1
screen a plus as	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
the software not and the driver working with other sound blaster products dumb	0
i this phone for my trip to south africa it worked almost perfectly	1
delivery was prompt	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the life very lttle it uploads mp s quickly there no delay between songs	0
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
also unlike my previous player	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
allows the usb interface the router used for nas or print server	1
oops easy to go online and adjust there	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the grain was	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the remote is a little to understand	0
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
what is wrong with this thing	0
easy set up	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
lrb connection service restored when the computer was connected directly	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the price performance looked just right	1
it is worth it	1
do nt know people are saying awesome	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
it came well packaged	1
is easy	1
the quality is good it takes more than good result in a good product	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
well days the quit working	0
great colors pictures and white balance	1
ripping my collection this gives average of around mb per cd good for about cds free memory available to me	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
other than that i purchase this all over again	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
is another hard to operate screwed music library up nt with s the	0
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
had for weeks and it is the best player i ve used	1
the keys are out is no	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the netgear router was simple to set up worked well for the couple to few i have	1
i love player	1
again the sounds spot on from where they should of the tv	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity the on the thing	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
very compact and portable as	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
this is in its price and category i have ever used	1
have even and already i am disapointed	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
and settled on this of the small size speakerphone option and	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
was willing overlook this unit has a myriad of features	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do play one after another a cd	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
also reason the picture washed out lots to a component connection	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
this router is awesom but it only you can never more to have a open nat type are usualy moderate or strict when i support they were very nice tried best to it working right but to no avail bottom line you just have a computer and you	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
taking for a bus just having lunch at the park you ll be you	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
tiny remote unit is not does it trigger the shutter can be used to zoom pictures	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the to automatically put the information is nt always accurate	0
remote does to get confused at times and does but it may just operator error	0
i would be inclined to an apex product	1
at am and be this awful deceptive product back	0
like the automatic key lock	1
the from t mobile	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
would have much nicer window you and if did up the ac jack	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
the lens of better picture quality you just much closer	1
at first dealt with	1
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i was looking forward to it the other said it was slow	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
fm receiver none	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
it great to to spot metering and on the lcd screen	1
of all my calls loud and clear with sprint	1
the sound lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection only it is in which case see you reflection on the screen	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1

the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
it is extremely light and your pocket	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
have songs for the weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
first sound is but cause audio interference about	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0

they are not wowable good	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1

i hooked it up everything to	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
a very good option for who has a lapdesk external speakers	1

with the monitor and the company	1
highly camera to anyone looking for good digital camera that takes great pictures yet take weeks to to operate	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0

i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
for the most part is good dvd	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
that make volumn a little bit louder	0
the only things is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight everyone elses is too	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
the grain was terrible	0
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
the storage is great for me	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
the sound quality good	1

beautiful home theater speaker and respectable	1
this phone good with a huge array of features	1
can the volume be heard that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
loading all i now is either or busy	0
it is small	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
and the and excellent better than i ve seen	1
good battery	1
a feet away a brightly lit room during day time produced blurry and in	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
i have yet to try all adjustment priority aperature priority light metering all controls are well out and manual is relatively clear	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
ice age	1
it is made of plastic	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
and have had any problems with dvds	0
it unlike canon slr fits in	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
the player usually plays dvd is but as not stopping a particular in a we played it not being able to access special features a rental dvd	0
polyphonic tones nice it also doubles as a radio a nice feature you are bored	0
this is by far the in so many ways	1
the price easy to navigate existing has a removable battery	1

each my creative mp players had in the first place	1
the range is or in basement four bars the time	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
can it because when does work it is pretty good	0
d polite and but just worked a script and	0
because of it is hidden features i keep baby region is	1
small size	1
t is does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1

was occasionally lip sync	0
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
dad also an apex tv and was another great value for the money	1
unfortunately the player would of my region though were in any way	0
as a it worked fine and the extra ram stop it in fact it better than my own laptop so i change this one as soon possible	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
tried called cust service no help	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
the picture clear bright and and sound	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0

sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
it works great	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how manuver the menus	1
customer service and technical support are you about of their products and stand behind them	1

i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
i on lrb you connected right away and do have to wait rrb and got at least macbook back online	1
the bang for the buck out	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the connect to the router a nice feature when up from my various computers	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
but about i ve on ithave problem when watching movie the will freeze still plays and eventualy back after skipping a few moments	0
great speakers overall	1
delivers what must be considered the best image quality tonal color response point of view	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
a portable player	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
good battery life	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1

it has	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours the battery did not even down one single bar	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors why i	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
without any tweaking at all if is accurate the colors are as realistic i seen by film this is a raw image	1
it play all cd disc	0

i really have no complaints over this unit	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1

and it works great too	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
the big backlight things and the writing is enough for people to see	1

as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
well within days the video output quit working	0

in fact	1
phone won me over a big seller the size fits any pocket	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
loading cds was somewhat consuming think have been with the ipod as well	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1

creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
is amazing	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
i like the nomad is better is terribly flashy	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0

the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
progressive scan player a relatively low price	1
the black fly wheel feels is uncomfortable to use	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0

transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
i have all the features yet the camera is to once get used to it	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0

there which has been in about the features of this phone is a great phone mine worked any problems right out of the box	0
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1

however if reliability and to signal your requirements do the job	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
i m not web browsing so this phone	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1

this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
playlists to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would	0

it and has a good signal strength	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0

quality is excellent except maybe a tad when there quieter talkers the end	1
is and the speakerphone is excellent	1
it would spin read more and then show there was no disc	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
i understand the does not when it the cds in alphabetical order	0
but with a low price comes	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1

without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
the functionality on is mind blowing	1
i was was nt	0
from the is ok	1
so far have and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone wants a harddrive based mp player wants to next	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful to use quality and compact in size	1

fiance ordered is a teacher so she needed a small computer would bringing work home her	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
ooh and still this little camera features i nt even gotten to all of them yet	0
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
it came well packaged	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0

it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0

the device itself is pretty	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
first the cons not the asthetic looking and does support stucture	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
to most dvds quietly	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
speakerphone	1

the price the lowest i d my research lrb office	1

what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0

halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
fragile	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
overall an excellent phone	1
in addition with a remote control	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
very simple to use	1

i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0

this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
these speakers incredibly	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1

i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
for the	1
but the price was right	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1

support line the line was very helpful	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1

while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
much faster than my acer netbook	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1

i like it	1
you can store which is a plus for want just you have an ipod nt bother is a much better buy	1
its being slightly larger the ipod i must i was to small it was when i unwrapped	1

the is easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
i have to i m pretty impressed by the user interface for playing mp and mpeg files on	1
this unit was fine the st month and a half then disappeared	0
also quite comfortable does getting used to	1
cons i the satellites ugly	0
fantastic little computer everything	1
the perfect size it has the features would want	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
for a budget this camera	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
sound enhancement feature did do for me custom eq limited eq	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
all suprisingly easy to use	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
i want be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
flawlessly	1
if i were to these speakers i a stars giving because the job want them	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
recent price have made in digital cameras currently available	1
hook	1
disappointed me is that seem read certain dvds	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
when put this phone your pocket you there it is unbelievably small oh so	0
honestly i love this player	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
it worked great we pluged	1
works great	1
all extremely pleased with this camera	1
if you do nt have tags it ll all of your tracks and can searched artist or album the does not recognize folders	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
is a travesty enough said	0
color screen is good	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
this lame	0
volume level is ok	1
is slightly lighter with	1
overall i the and	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
over the network storage is slow only use does too much	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
and it works great too	1
this nt bother it is a decent size	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
they respond to line busy	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
the problem this box is it reboots if not more frequently	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
it has never worked	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
are absolutely amazing the minutest	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
one i this monitor a price than what can get in the	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i	1
my first impression was positive	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i followed the easy instructions in manual and online at the router is login there is will work choose to it	1
great camera great investment	1
sound can be	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
price	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
my dwl ap work di s there is update to support this	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via i d tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
billy joel was kidding when you get a cheep pair speakers	1
d venture to because it is low cost is the best pc stereo	1
tells me the nomad run be at best a gb hard t create folders or at worst a lesson companies never to from again	0
spectrum sound to	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
still but it would not through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
operating its many features is and often i m no annie lebovitz i able to out most of its abilities around with it a camera store	1
after much frustration i upgraded the firmware the latest dd wrt firmware at dd	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
i spent hours on that and i nt	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the player itself	1
but after days worked but the video	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
sure it would can useful in a different setting would need your volume be	1
a price that still than i to the best part it works as great as was to	1
software the software is crap	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
are lots of interesting features included eax and	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
it is easy beginners but features that photographers will love it an excellent grow into	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
i would like it i gave it a because well for me during the time i have owned it	1
i also running wall rated insulated gauge the stands this perfectly even through the groove in	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
which fine	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the keys are close together and in keypads but is not	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
looks very cool seems quite me very light	1
and easy to	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
tech support from apex	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
however it does not play windows media and can not it to play of divx	0
this camera also has great feel weight	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
not the i spent the songs was pretty painless	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
love this and	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
matter the format	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
canon g tons of control but has an auto mode it very easy novice to use	1
i sent my monitor in for for such a very problematic problem random buzzing from	0
but in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
if you looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
storage capacity	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
few inconveniences because it those features bluetooth and high spend but there very few with things you phone to do	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
the canon software download sort and manage your digital pictures nice very use	1
it has life fm excellent signal free speakerphone downloadable java apps	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
the environmental audio however is and has made of my songs worse without it	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and satisfied at i	1
i have no problem this product	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
and worked out of the box	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it is so small but big value	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
other than that this thing is great	1
or that this thing ready for prime time	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
nice and compact	1
e mailing they back undeliverable	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
great product my	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
and with the bass boost fills outs well	1
great good interface replaceable powerful good wake up multiple play modes	1
is from creative	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
it great for have rented	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
here the brief is tiny cute feels	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
location i still its	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
other then that it display for the price	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size initially to this little gem because of the superior mega pixel	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
the sound quality is excellent unit cool is bright and easy to read and the battery the ipod	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
the and everything	1
the is sound quality do any and that miss	0
is ok if are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to my cds i bought the and guess what	0
just received this camera two ago and already love the features it	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
the person other end of the call hear you perfectly	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
i could was cheap monitor as soon as i set it	0
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
they really just as the reviews say	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
my only significant complaint sound quality	0
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
light correction is awesome	1
then sorting the files is as pie	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
i spend hours a vnc session with colors change across panel look from the center to	0
only one complaint you can activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the while it ringing	0
it does in	1
the first we did nt work and our kids were	1
features really cool the radio	1
price	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
i found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
it just a light weight non intrusive device which can anywhere	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
network storage it slow	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
take for me already a one the highest flashes money can	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
i find all of well and not in the least	0
my first impression was positive	1
is a big improvement over	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
the build quality is top notch	1
best in sound	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below	0
it a camera well	1
call which immediately by very helpful competent tech	1
the out of hard plastic and put some rubber	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
small similarly small speakers	1
the volume is you can it if you want	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
surfing the web on it is nice as just there more wap pages available	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
the software mediasource can work on	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
update the device flawlessly for the past year	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
needed three batteries to keep myself the battery real powerhouse	0
what makes lag time can live with is the extreme depth field obtainable with these at	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
could be but no complaints	1
so sit back relax and all your friends a mountain for a dvd player that can do a fraction of the price	1
it approximately to seconds to come lrb i have timed it rrb which sound that bad get nailed times in one hour lrb is bad as it for hours without rebooting rrb	0
video stopped	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
battery life is ok	1
