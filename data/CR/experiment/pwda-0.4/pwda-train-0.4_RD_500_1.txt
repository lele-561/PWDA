the picturers are amazing	1
easy to use with clear contained the drive	1
it works great too	1
i have this camera exceeded	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
full with of for	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
they sound just as say	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
at first dealt with this as mbps still fast	1

has worked flawlessly for me and at this price can go	1
i have only used this dvd player for about hours it for my for christmas but find problems with dvd	0
overall i like it	1

the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1

when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
megapixels and the photo quality	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
however if speed reliability and power to a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
but if used a slr mm camera controls are very intuitive	1
simple back and very easy access and use	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the my nd generation	0
predecessor the nx this player boasts size and relatively intuitive system categorizes id tags and excellent sound	1

this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
because other people that about this player are talking bull player it just breaks fast horrible	1

megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
besides	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
auto setting does a great most there are manual settings	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the in a compact form with metal plate	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
it surpasses	1

nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1

this	1
is more than days and show the picture no what do	0
over for a unit	0
was very and helpfull actually	1

battery to most digital cameras quote k reeves	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the d extreme works as a n wireless router	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the woofer is much larger	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1

i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
you	1
typically the the it was for me and many others	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1

i m not shoddy construction something paid	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
was occasionally lip sync	0
i m not happy with this machine or acer	0

the features are really cool like the radio	1
over a fantastic very compact camera which us experience photography on a totally new level	1

despite highly g	0
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
honestly i	1
a few of my work the g highly the canon for picture quality	1
this a great piece speaker system for a computer is worth penny	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the device itself is pretty	1
however a phone call to the was answered they guided through without a problem	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
this camera has find out more just log on	0
was a to up and my ps asus eee droid pcs connect without issue	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
this that there is a good chance that not easily like typical american phones	1
phone won me over a big seller the size fits any pocket	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i no end what i do with it	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
this is with battery life	1

the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
the bang for the buck out	1
excellent heavy build quality the stands are and blend well the rest of my furniture	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
navigating the menus is super easy especially if owned	1
protective case as is since obscures display window	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the	1
i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy solely upon	1

stored is on this barely	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
bright visible screen	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
only thing creative is a burner	0
the scroll wheel is easy and works for me however many complained	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
in of someone who does nt it will yield good results on auto mode	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
main dial is not backlit	0
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
the software and does nt on	1
very easy to set up	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the dvd dvd r dvd r rw	1
the main reason i am satisfied this is the fact it will lock up at odd	1
i ve this thing for less than a month it quite well never and the is all screwed up	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1

year there are problems	0
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
the it is a very nice dvd player	1
by far the finest camera its price and have ever used	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
for instance made several back ups plays the dvds	1
my and wd live tv box normally lean back and good firmware and well forever thereafter	1
great	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0

the monitor works very well a	1
the player itself has all of problems	0
am and the quality of images am getting from this g and can because i ve anything better within its resolution limits	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
in other words the zen not a data only buy need for your music collection	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
canon is are better and i believe their processing algorithms	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
door	1
for users indicated i should load the cd rom but turns it only pdf of instructions and nothing way for apple computers	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
the screen	1
