transfering is easy everythig software makes the pretty easy	1
no more than or hours and to for a long time stays takes at most charged the battery fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
of are on the side because the controls on the front which hold the thing like i that is where my thumb instead when i is	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
the keypad is a decent size the power but on off key is small and difficult to press	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
in it if we could get one camera only	0
took it imo player get use to the navigation a me is but very user friendly to a few tries	1
just an average user good value getting in this product	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0

with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
the and backlight larger than the previous model the nx has is a green backlight the which illuminates successfully screen more the than lcd nx is bright blue did	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
of will your whole idea this machine be what a laptop should change	1
the software found is quick easy to use i the entire process very easily mastered	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1

anyone despite this minor disappointment the recommend highly canon who i is g serious about digital photography	0
for up wonderful was picking it day the next and about paying amazon the return shipping	1
behind them service and to are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you technical support the quality of their about willingness and customer their stand products	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
for a all is this has a small portable computer very good all option anyone who wants and a in lapdesk and external speakers	1
and works great too it	1
with songs of storage on the player have about gb i with room for about more	1
enabling the theory stopped but was great well the guest network things working upon	1
if i tech already emailed it ve support for me creative and gotten about fix they will responses it timely but necessary	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
some other way fully expect the construction to go it again in i same is or in bad the as other reviewers have pointed out the next months pretty flimsy because	0
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
and of plastic in general has the stainless steel heft after the body construction a disappointment quite a bit of the s	0
