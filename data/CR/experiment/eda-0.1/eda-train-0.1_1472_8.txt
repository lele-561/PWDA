my crappy gripe is the incredibly other remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
the manual mode use of goods and services is dissipated easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out newbie of the box	1
also hurt the display is hinged and it can be placed as well in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the tween music collection on the computer	1
the sound great and the volume is more than for and shutting external noise	1

the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
poorly the menu system and controls are second designed	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be a hard albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson companies never to buy products from again	0
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
lots of wakeless options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1

the problem is that the speed anything has connected to it has been around even when in same room	0
sound recording is excellent	1
well the was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped	0
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at exist best	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
pc cable is usb expensive for a too cable	0
i find onionskin all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1

as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great	1
the software which comes with player is not good at entirely all	0

alas the facility software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
a damage great system at an incredible price	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional some unknown company to all the features	1
in that respect for the price there is nothing better	1
it would have been much prissy if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the alternating electric current jack	0

however novel shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
eax features are pretty as well as creative included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a or on a train	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better shortsighted choice than an ipod	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a identical computer speaker upright rrb this is probably necessary	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for parents	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although digital at the highest blurry zoom are a little pictures	1

my only complaint i a is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that to did malfunction if it was date or of the router	0
however for a choice i think this camera is an excellent budget	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only be one the battery could way inserted	1
huge storage isnt i loaded my entire collection of music which space you much songs and still have gb out of the provided to that	1
pictures taken an indoor setting are a dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0

computer keyboard well backlit keypad	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
these them have great sound but they will buzz if you leave speakers on with the sound turned up	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record carnegie sounded like player hall	1

best in class sound	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer effective organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
it a just such is nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
the inside pics can fire up be a bit challenging but when you can exist instantly delete operating room pics you dont like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very and the quality is very good	1
what disappointed me is the that does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the quick sync is nt good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
i m very pleased with my zx so here exist is a quick review	1
very intuitive menus are a plus big on this camera	1

simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
this actor seems to work fine with everything else	1
setup is simple and it worked right childlike out of the box	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way along too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
even better with the optional headset can you listen to music over the integrated radio	1

the level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as ampere mm	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1

definitely more capable of with the room filling sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect often out of the small headphones you insert in the ear enclosed space	0
easy to pair	1
i should trusted the online about the terrible repair team of acer	0

the controls are somewhat harder price use huge the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would than the justify difference in to	0
i player really impressed by this dvd am	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices honorable achievement for a hard drive based player	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0

i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
deficiencies with zennx are software system easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0

my gut tells me the nomad will corrupt in the long driving run be at best a gb bribe portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy assure products from again	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once in one case the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0

the canon computer software used overnice to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures squeamish on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1

however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked marvelous	1
lilliputian i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to mathematical product be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i selective information gave all the information i could	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have dialing	1
i fell in love with ease camera it combines this of an with use immense amount of options and power	1
