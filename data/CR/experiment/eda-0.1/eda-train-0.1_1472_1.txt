over for the price this is a good unit	1
the monitors were both good	1
this phone is a winner	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
would nt buy again because of the service	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the province	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windowpane which is what i have	1
typically the problem and the headphone jack it was for me is many others	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
i ordered it on a monday from lrb around pm rrb time with no extra shipping costs the monitor was door my at in chicago by the and i got home afternoon work tuesday	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
the instructions that come with teaching it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
issue one my with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag year from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the data field	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is information technology advertised	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel navigate to	0
so besides the annoyances this is a speaker for the amount i paid	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached driving to this wireless router to be seen in exist the actual networked local capable computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
i m sure it would can be useful in a different one where you only need your at a whisper	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
i was surprised to find that stack this could only dvd allowed play mpeg format which player me to not movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
i st it only due stars to the fact that the gave one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are good provided that your subject is more than about away	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
it was loose enough to remove the front plate and there was only one fashion the battery could be inserted	1
the resolution colors very good and the is are bright and even changeable	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes unbelievable pictures	1

however i do national trust like to persuade it on my belt because the clip is national trust secure and the case can slip off	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
in other words the zen is for a convenient data buy device only storage the capacity you need not your music collection	0
but this great is camera	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
the pictures icon are razor sharp even in macro	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and for the return shipping	1
exist it is made of plastic	0
that was dissapointed i acer was nt more helpful	0
i find it too bright	0
ve electronic i best bought since i was born	1
it has a nice color screen	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
without any tweak at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as ive ever so seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
on i were to rate these m if my listening needs i would give a stars but the speakers giving because i think they do i job that most people want them for	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
fact is it nt could be easier to use	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
mixed bag i guess price the but was right	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the design is sleek and the screen color has good resolution	1
bright visible screen	1
the sound character is very exceptable	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
the zoom size up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom of about one quarter at the way down from the top of the screen interferes that with viewing goes most settings	0
and it works great too	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
this router the is best i have used to date	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider one purchasing more of these super displays	1
have tried to contact apex address e mail but the e mail via is not valid	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to indiana bog it down to the point where land i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order software system to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
it would either not play the sung dynasty at all or skip wildly no matter that the whole was resting on my desk	0
finding a particular album or song on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
on the side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and do not answer their web support	0
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
the memory is staggering	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
i am very proud of with it so far	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
bad thing that it comes with pitiful compactflash card and most purposes it is not enough	0
this is the best dvd thespian i ve purchased	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny picayune shut up out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
my only bellyache about the hardware is the buttons	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
the battery life is mystify	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
this is extemely lame	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0

they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
no way to contact their service customer	0
checked the amazon and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
i this will have problems in the and the for the year questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
please consider this much superior piece art object of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
it is easy use to and yet very feature rich	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1

i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
minor complaints music though the tag is sorted via id music on the player the option to search for even contained in a folder is unavailable	0
the lcd screen readable very large and was	1

apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with requirement	0
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
the display is hinged and it can be placed a myriad of positions to protect it any damage	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
lupus erythematosus way less expensive than the ipod	1

in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
i highly recommend it	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the being to control my recommend this tower	1

excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
however if focal ratio reliability and power to transmit a signal across the sign of the zodiac are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1

the sound that came from that cheap little record carnegie sounded like player hall	1
good run speed	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
the scroll bar is a travesty plenty said	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0

no propietary headset jack	0
and so far have not had any problems not dvds with being able to play	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1

now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
lrb lost connection with the router internet service restored when computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1

the price looked just right	1
lock like the automatic key i function	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
easy to pair	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
setup is simple in good order and it worked right out of the box	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
i just set it up manually which is very soft	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able buy to another easily	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0

clitoris depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
thank mathematical product thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
hooked it worked undimmed like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long sufficiency enough	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to orchard apple tree that	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
very happy with the monitor the price	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for mobile as a carrier	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as ear good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd ear player	1
however it has miscarry failed to deliver on quality	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for study work travel	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same vocalise name	0
the peek changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
also navigate while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
fragile	0
the canon computer software package used to download sort upload and grapple your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
finally making playlists from the can computer be complicated are the tracks are listed alphabetical and are organized by cd which are not listed but because organized in individually order	0
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
means usb fast data transfers	1
i m not very happy with machine this or acer	0
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
well backlit fountainhead keypad	1
with it the anytime we made changes to the we router had to manually press enabled turn on radio button on the front of the gui because the router one would nt work	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this exist price point	1

but if you deficiency a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1

i was able to take great july of the th of photos fire amazing and got some works shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
to my amazement even that exist process was error prone	0
it a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1

considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
great is a this camera for you	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
i started get at and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
some other all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
for the price there nothing is better	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
the proctor were both good	1
the connection is not reliable connecter and constantly dropped	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
they re pretty comfortable decent in place and deliver a stay audio quality	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
this player has work worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
first i ll start scratch line off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
they fired away and the visualise turned out quite nicely	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
the barrage fire is nice	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp role player including sansas and ipods	1
this is a exist nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather cockcrow listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i am very delight with its quality and durability	1
the other day when i was mind to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
my dwl ap does not work as a s for di repeater and there is firmware no update to support this product	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the green more the than successfully nx is screen backlight did	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still operate perfectly	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking fair the discs to find that the apex is fair actually ruining my media	0
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
progressive scan player for a participant relatively low price	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the screen is large and easily read	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
i tried to play the sung dynasty three times with no success	0
it gives great pictures the are easy to use battery lasts forever on single charge the software is user friendly and it is beautiful it chrome	1
it works great	1
the other controls are all exist very easy to use	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
the usb port on the back is overnice a nice feature	1
this highly recommend i camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does figure take weeks to nt out how to operate	1
ooh and i dropped it it still works this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten all of them yet	1
storage capacity	1
while i would like to give it stars instead gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have it	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
the battery is nice	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends paid a mountain of for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of price	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
they sound really good reviews as the just say	1
i do nt a to be want sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
bookmarks for example non are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
otherwise a very monitor for its price	1
the tiny remote unit is terrific not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom along and review pictures	1
the sound is awesome but might u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound if crack	1
i really love this netbook	1
set was easy to monitor up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
good looks	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets fin stars because of its affordability	1
however the chief reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd sentence	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
i loved it until it broke but to a lesser extent than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to shape	0
can nikon re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you if end your search with the you	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
the fm wireless is cool	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
well flash photos are never great and there was lot a still of noise	0
it is slightly light headed than the g and packed with even more features	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
great picture	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
it has good color and price was great	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
one other issue is testament that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and unsuccessful was	0
seems is versatile and it to be one of the best	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
it is enough light to carry around all day without bother	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
i quickly got to use the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
frame household freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
zennx is replaceable battery the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
cultivate the dvd player does not work properly	0
i love this player go would probably and with creative labs again	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easy easily fits in my pocket	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
it great and is loaded with features	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
so alir i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance as well anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay off next to nothing	1
speakerphone	1
the g afterwards had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had job been released a few seconds	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
i gave the zen because it is excellent the class that it is in and it not really appropriate to it on players in a different class	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
the door would not close	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim encase as publicise	1
you can do indeed so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi nontextual matter files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if icon you know how to program jme you can even a lot make your own apps games	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb ever so power adapter	0
the sound quality has been poor since day unrivalled the base constantly drops yell and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no thirster consumption the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where good was metal concerned was i that the sound would not be as there	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
i have it outlook for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
loved the slim design	1
when i st tried it i base that it had no problem roleplay the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would playact but to my surprise was capable to playact cheep media that i had sunburn that i could nt get to piece of work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
the manual mode use of goods and services is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to pick fumble through menu options	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
for the money machines have features	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
fine worked	1
now there is one more complaint about the g and that is the that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did replace mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as to	0
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
the canon software for raw images strike does not present you with photographic camera a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed in the buff by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
and is a great piece speaker system for a computer this it is worth every penny	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
however since i am in they office i low keep them at a pretty low volume and at normally volumes an sound a little weak	0
it sounds great out on the terrace or on my night stand	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for	1
navigation be could better there but is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have dialing	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
it audio read and play all cd will disc	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
support product hopeless company and hopeless customer hopless	0
this model router has now fail me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the sounds were signify as the movie directors intended	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
it has a x fair optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
some features in the user interface	0
the controls are affair on the side instead of on the front which i like because that mastery is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
sufficiency it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
it is crystal clear	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
simple click buttons back buttons volume and are very easy to read access and use	1
more more i work with it the the i love it	1
as stands now case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
not plug play relies on gem state no fm or recording	0
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
i m also bore running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the conducting wire stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
images taken indoor so nt were clear	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
setup software be my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to for useless	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is exist terrific	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the interface software itself which simply should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
forget about the can looks if it sleek t play some of your real dvds	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
the sound quality is very right	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
quality picture in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other a lot models i ve had	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they information technology asked for usd just to look at it and said that they fry would recharge charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
setup was very easy	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
but dollar there dollar this dvd player is probably the best out for	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i comparable it	1
it is tall so i ended english up laying it on its side	0
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
sound the first quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
i can t rate it one star only because when cultivate it does work it is pretty good	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
the apex has been a vertex steady performer for me	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no print instructions with it just a crude pictorial direction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
battery life identical is indistinguishable very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally exist if now and then we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
on the up side the phone amazing has battery life	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is actually annoy when it does because it does it so often	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the soar upwards images are quite telling	1
love i this player	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
one good thing it upright is gb of disk space	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a bighearted zero	0
nd dvd player had a faulty supply which caused occasionally not on	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d	0

the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a plus	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of people of colour bleeding equate to a component connection	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
this phone has fair many other features ir just to name one the features fair above i view as the most beneficial	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0

update jan the flawlessly has worked device for the past year	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs all they and play great	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly exist designed and does not work well	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon token arrived in great shape	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory ampere and they cannot seek be searched via artist or album serve as the zen does not recognize folders	0

excellent battery bombardment life hours beats ipod is	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1

the g has a different type of battery charging you from the smaller canon use the battery needs to also charged while in the camera system the charging system be enables but to cameras the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
