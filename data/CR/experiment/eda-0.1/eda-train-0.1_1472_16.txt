it is fits unlike my canon slr so it easily small in my pocket	1
the keyboard information technology is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
this camera was affordable very to learn and produces spectacular images	1
i am quite happy with the tv camera	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
this player seems to work fine else	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
i worked tried the belkin radio transmitter unit with it it ve well on i set it when top of a portable fm but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
it has good discolour and price was great	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
in summary i love this and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
flash as with all indiana built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
what got me to buy was the universal gas constant reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
does what it should and the sound seems delicately to me	1
the to labs zen xtra has all amazon features the i pod has and if you get if from the your only going creative pay for this great player	1
the battery is alot better than most of the call up out there	1
well lasted was nice while it it	1
get it it is information technology woth every penny	1
but in any case the only thing you should really await at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly well off	1
well this speaker wonders the same does for my low end ht setup	1
this is extemely lame	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
this way is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some experience used to	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
the player hangs up on file actuate transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
but dollar for dollar dvd player is probably the out there	1
it dialing does nt have voice activated also big minus	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you buy do nt purchase it	0
the macro mode is exceptional with pictures are very clear and the can take the pictures the the lens unbelievably close you subject	1
also as well very light and portable	1
it also has a stock tracking app ramp up in and a somewhat useful practical application which converts all types of metrics	0
the player has its minor on like for example when off turn it glitches percent of the is it sais shutting down to means i have which turn i and turn it on again which time not to my likings	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
and it works great too	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
first i ll start scratch line off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i find this to be a slap up feature	1

it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or lean feature rrb	0
subsist in a small college flat the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
only thing missing from burner is a cd creative	0
be cook for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
speakerphone	1
this is the third apex product bought ve i and they continue to impress for the price	1
for the cost of this product i could not need for more	1
the subwoofer is a shade boomy and s cubic decimeter o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer cognise turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0

i treat the battery advantageously and it has lasted	1

limit have nt had time to really push this player to the nomad but audio aspects on the i are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really and the music continues play as left it you it off	1
also the presentation is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of posture or to protect it against any damage	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
it is running great for all the dvds have	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of give rise lrb very good for a computer verbaliser rrb this is probably necessary	1
the participant dvd player is fine	1
participant i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1

last night needed i to reset the router	0
all the buttons neccessary lil button gadgets are on the sides of exist the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1

huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much song and still have gbit out of the provided to you	1

the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did national trust notice after first hour interval	0

exist overall it is the best camera on the market	1
the scene mode exploit well for the residuum of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1

the set up is goofball proof and offers a superior result	1
however its x setting optical is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and dissimilar it is indiana not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a information technology different class	1
the cover that with it did nt fit very well	0

the cyberspace functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t nomadic is services because they have edit the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0

even better with the optional headset can you listen to music over the integrated radio	1
it is tall so i ended up its side	0
the eax mode that keeps the in at the same level for any song will come my handy when i take volume holiday plane rides	1

the first one cultivate we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
my fiance ordered computer she is teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not participant bring through just the computer	1
the cover that come up came with it did nt fit very well	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than i computer	1

very tight joints excellent black finish and precise utterer wire hook ups	1
excellent heavy establish calibre and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1

i specially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
lots of sound options has winamp equalizer almost like an with the options	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1

the usb port on the back is a nice sport	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the in good order features of this job phone it is a great phone mine worked without any work problems right out of the box	1
i chose this one because from for i read it was the best deal what the money	1
but for what simply i do use it is perfect	1
great camera great investiture	1
i was looking onwards to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
no one ever so sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0

all and all i am pleased with this	1
the aff did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the and the image looked normal	1
but if you neediness a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers whatsoever i ve owned	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and ultrasharp in terms contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
the for over price this is a good unit	1
i feel the apex ad to be a great buy	1
i to sure it would and can be useful different a in setting one where you would only need your volume m be at a whisper	1
not windowpane only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
overall a good for buy the price	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
no pixels on mine	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
this was very prompt touchstone shipping service	1

naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are invincible	1
but this is not documented in zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i fully expect it to go exist bad again in the same or some other way in the next once again months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is lapp pretty flimsy	0
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing ampere special	1
this product purchase definitely worth the is	1
slr alike programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure scope provide excellent photo if you do nt want to bother with the scope	1

the software repeatedly	0

the backlight on the phone goes off way of life too quickly and there is no way of life to change this	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like hour angle winamp with the options	1

i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
it great works	1
tech support pleasent and once you actually got someone	1

i got it today it great sound for its size and i understand the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are different things that be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone highly recommend this tower	1
i have been ripping rend songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
however mathematical product you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
from sound the the player is ok	1
pull your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of information technology time for non something to work	0
the sound from the player is alright	1
it well came packaged	1

we remotes purchased universal ve so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
i this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
only about two weeks so expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
there are limitations to you can with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
function its many features is gentle and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera shop	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected toss off to get upright a good quality tone product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
when have windows xp pro and i installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing driver the	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does non not seem to read certain dvds	0
either way can go wrong with this price	1
changing brightness is with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
i hate apex but love simply amazon and i tell everyone	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older prince philip philips machine	1
my ace issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to live the year field	0
would nt buy again because of the customer serve	0
this phone won me nicely into a big seller was the size it fits over and any pocket without falling out	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better design than the s	1
in other words the zen is not a commodious data storage device only buy the capacity you ask for your music collection	0

the system was nowhere nearly stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1

seemed like a good deal but this frequently cannot recognize dvds and music takes long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
even when you nt securespot completely it will upon reboot your saying your computer is new even when it is disable and keep you to tell it that force computer is authorized	0
apex is the comfortably cheap quality brand for dvd players	1

well it had good power but no precision at all	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0

when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how unspoilt the screen is	1

i thought information technology it was just the simply player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
while upgrading the the keyboard connector broke	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a presentation of the zoom size about unitary quarter of the way down from the top of the screen door that interferes with regard at most settings	0

it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
other tagging problems result from system of rules the nomad is operating system	0

not only is it perfect the size it also has all the features a high phone tech user would want	1
with all its features the menus are easily and the quality of the features is great	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display windowpane	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the i d heard about acer support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
my tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from	0
it flawlessly during installation of cx	1
clean vivid bright lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
remote you and stand it on end can it is far better designed than the s	1
setup software for my application i found the apparatus setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
ticket worked fine	1
without a doubt i would say that these utterer have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are sincerely portable lrb can be played without a power electrical outlet i love that feature rrb	1
my friends were impressed the quality of pictures took	1
the eax mode that keeps volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when take my holiday plane rides	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
the outside is a little hard to understand	0
i really have no complaints over this unit of measurement	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital cajole audio outputs though the latter exist was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
it has the features one need in a	1
the more work with the more i love it	1
answered message was neither	0

i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of exchangeable characteristics	1
they do look cool in the though	0
and contrast are perfect for my	1
well to do to pair	1
the eq sound enhancement feature did nt do a for me and the custom eax was enough limited band eq	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly as one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices based achievement for a hard drive good player	1
transplant is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day always got a busy signal	0
one other reinforcement plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
unfortunately it can t fiddle all of the dvd	0
the arduous drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
the book	0
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
great phone i d buy another	1
sub woofer is expectant	1
transfer record through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to record simply drag and drop files from windows explorer through and through to a folder for the nomad	1
as a unharmed whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone whatsoever i ve ever had	1
the software on the router is pretty in force	1
the device is small and considerably designed i would recomment it highly	1
lastly i sense that the verbalizer were over priced for what i bring lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
my first impression was positivistic	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
has a beautiful design lots of very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is	1
overall social unit i like the unit	1
this is my second player and it is definitely fine product	1
this in by far the nicest one is so many ways	1
and as love extremely low loud bass and i such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
this manakin router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the second position is working just fine	1
it a just such is nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the linksys router i had been using for years	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
died very stick shortly after getting them	0
remain i extremely pleased with this router	1
with mediasource being so easy i found for use no the bundled nomad explorer software	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i did buy week notmad software a the ago and found that a vast improvement	1
the trashy user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
still i was willing overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
folders sound recording cannot be created for the audio files	0
also the feature to automatically put selective information in the song information is nt always accurate	0
volume stage level is ok	1
the colors and everything are capital	1
it sounds decent but i would judge you get maybe of the lineament that you would from a true line out jack	0
i love this player and am highly extremely happy with my decision	1
vocals clarity greater have with the ihome as well	1
of bought i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and course a for one as a christmas present second my parents	1
i own it however i can t imagine being it	1
one other issue is testament that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
this router is phenomenal	1
the remote is a exist little hard to understand	0
all in entirely all suprisingly easy to use	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to allege i am very satisfied	1
this machine a change your whole idea of what will laptop should be	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
this led is fantastic	1
the day arrived finally when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
ilk however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work stick background signal i like to get done with some background even so music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are sensibilities	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to something on the screen lrb like i had to do with clunky old monitor rrb	1
the trouble came from my video card	0
however once you crank the great a little to a distracting a bit too level well the work i like to get done with speaker background music viola the audio is volume lrb for this is relative great for a computer some rrb	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was television receiver another great value for the money	1
i am stunned anything amazed at the and of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because ive never its quality better within seen resolution limits	1
in a i d say this is all decent router for the money	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who but reasonable set of small wants effective computer speakers at a a price	1
