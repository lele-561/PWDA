simply the canon nowadays g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
the voice this slim design puts out	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a bighearted zero	0
if you are not picky about persona quality go for it	0

on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt information technology survive a drop	0
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found with this camera very disappointing	0
the favorite thing about the nomad is my eax feature	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
the router has obviously problems with static informatics addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
the videodisc player is fine	1
this led monitor is fantastic	1

gravid phone	1

easy enough but it did not work	0
software take up definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0

mid range is nt the but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone looking to spend on computer	0
the service from t liothyronine mobile is very good too	1
the rate plans are too very good at least for me	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
the monitors were both good	1
the strait is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca national trust hear a thing	1

all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
while upgrading the the keyboard connector broke	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
i find it pretty easy to use information technology and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool djinny through the isp entirely and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
quality is excellent	1
connection speed to the other machines sometime seems awesome much quicker than the connecter router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of former the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
with the smooth knob line up i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it line up by feel alone	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the ticket amount i paid	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
nice and heavyset compact	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass ampere for which you would upright need a huge subwoofer	1
and the there well sound is no complaints about that	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
i love the this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass great	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time exist but there are manual settings for those serve who want them	1

the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not well	0
lots of sound pick has an equalizer almost like winamp with the pick	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stop watch	1
t is which does not work along several stretches on that same route	1
dogshit software the software is crap	0
image clarity is great ampere lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw exist image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the simply was atrocious several elements interface did nt work at all	0
for those who want the thump that this is very of producing lrb good capable for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
its silver magnesium camera is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip finish better than any other are i ve seen	1
halfway through the firmware rising slope advance bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the software has nt been a hassle me for at all	1
is so i ended up laying it on its side	0
the volume	0
neither message was	0
however once you crank the volume a niggling to a level a bit too trouble for the work i like to get done with some background music genus viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer verbalizer rrb	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen microcode replaced most of the through and through router is interface	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture flirt and sound is progress top notch	1
creative labs customer support internet site is useless	0
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at cultivate the router is astatine login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if testament you choose to use it	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends paid a mountain of for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of price	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was entreat but after the shutter had been let go a few seconds	0
the combination and the price storage size of player features makes this player the best on the market	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
the windowpane premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
my one issue the software is that despite id tag data from the service ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case sturdy and offers very good protection	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and photo quality is awesome	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and recommended the canon for picture quality	1
if you want a calibre product delivered on time buy this one	1

it is a great phone if you are traveling all over world wonderful features	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1

its focusing system exist is also very flexible	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1

as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the exist picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a reasonably utile application which converts all types of metrics	0
another gracious thing is that the building block has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
sharp image	1

the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are good provided that your subject is more than about away	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the internet functions of the will work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to used on a different network	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably bribe more for the front channels	1

i love the bass this thing gets i have two my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the is great	1

the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0

creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should able to swap it out	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the first night i got this phone i put it to me when i went bed just to listen my favorite music station and the itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
and amazon com it such a great can you	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1

it information technology is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
the size is small	1
fact is it could nt be easier to economic consumption	1
the zoom size up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom of about one quarter at the way down from the top of the screen interferes that with viewing goes most settings	0
i loved it until it broke but to a lesser extent than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to shape	0
in increase it comes with a remote control	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard figure out	0

the grain was abominable terrible	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0

the sound is awesome but might u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound if crack	1
the that earbuds come with it are nt that bad	1
i especially love the remote big stand with it is controller volume knob and simple selector buttons	1

the functionality on this is camera mind blowing	1
this has so many experience capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot thousand to any potential buyer looking for a first social class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
size small	1

the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1

well backlit keypad	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
software sucks	0
even with these shortcomings i still the it is think best digital camera available under	1

it allows the usb interface the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
does what it should and the sound seems delicately to me	1

i have no complaints with this mp player	1
the sound quality is the except maybe a tad too quiet excellent times when there are quieter talkers on at other end of the line	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1

the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1

simply this product was created and was left behind	0
a week out of the corner and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more shop each day	0
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card a expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent see m m pixel fine combos and many of the are friendly functions user very similar to digital models and with added convenience you as slr camera that of can with pictures immediately	1
the interface used could be better ill used designed	0
this little speaker has dynamite reasoned	1
this wonderful merchandise was easy to unbox and install	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1

the battery is nice	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
i ve attempted to connect machine unit to several different tvs using a multitude and connection methods of i still can t get a video signal from the this	0
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings and i sure why do nt if it was something that i or if it was a of the	0
the filling does a fine job manual in any blanks that remain	1
all the of you lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when neccessary are holding it in the palm buttons your hand	1

it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1

it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well away laid out controls highly that can be learned quickly	1
not ounces it is pretty light but at as light as the ipod	1
i love this player	1
it played the one out of three dvd is without problems two other only being afflicted by a number of glitches	0

record screen was good easy to read	1
i wo nt go picture the details here great very online sites go into as depth in their reviews but i am the pleased with the features the speed the into quality the the flexibility automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1

bright seeable screen	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got soul	1

uploading upload the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
i m this cautious recommendation	1
no propietary headset jack	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
finally making playlists from unionize the computer can be complicated because the exist tracks are data track listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
the sound level is also not as high as would have expected	0
the computer software is not good either and the driver has disturb working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us work experience photography on a totally new level	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
upon opening these i found them having be really small but to a solid feel to them	1
very long lasting battery life	1
if re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
the combination of the damage storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a one half before it started to play up	0

anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
granted i have only used this player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for to find problems with this dvd player	0
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the is phone small light and very attractive	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
upright the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
image sharp	1
great moving picture	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but the was big zero	0
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
the setup process for the is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
the functionality on this camera is mind boast	1
in fact each creative mp players had problem in the first place	0
the remote works but then does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are something wrong	0

ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1

means usb fast data transfers	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0

it is easy	1

harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
for the price there nothing is better	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products was it useless and ugly	0
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
both units are small small similarly with speakers	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
weaknesses are minor mastery the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of small fry mp s with really indeed long names you must exist cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
however if stop number reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the subcontract	1
the monitors were upright both good	1
the canon software for raw images mise en scene does not present you with a icon raw image at all but stage the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1

the device itself is pretty solid	1
solid resistant to scratches heat better dissipation	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
i looking recommend this camera to anyone highly for a digital good camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1

that can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for you all i gave because the information i could	0
