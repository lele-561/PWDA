i recommend this camera enthusiastically	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
even band on works g better than the linksys	1
i not inclined an apex product be to purchase would again	0

the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
i had the problems player getting of my favorite dvds recognize two immediately to	0
in did play a dvd r which was unplayable older it my philips machine	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
the expensive way than less ipod	1
the pictures are fabulous are tons have nt even gotten to a learning curve to it there is their and features i of	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
find be i to this a great feature	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1

awesome sound system	1
to you hours on the phone get connected right away wait rrb spent at least and do i and have lrb nt got back my imac and macbook with their tech support online	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
was could as this as soon a cheap monitor i set it up tell i	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
want be a sensationalist nt i to this computer but do is incredible	1

to lot easy a has mentioned about this of reviews use	1
great colors pictures white balance and	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
great phone i d buy another	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1

so software with it bundled yes creative products useless and ugly all with was as	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
tablet a regular laptop that i is a than it is so much more convenient it love	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
use is great i to stains tough and to pick up listen on to my countertop it also to my old track records like this thing	0
it all my music any more have there that now on has nt i been problems	1
you hard meant scroll the buttons i and press enter to up pressing end when i have frequently to	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
sound quality is good	1
quite simply the for and ready os the that or this time is not thing firmware prime control	0
all are other and to sensitive buttons touch pretty work well	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1

i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
station for me control that the dsub cord from the sub to the the main problems is is too short	0
the overall a nikon very dependable robust and useful is little camera	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
picture great	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the polyphonic as a plus is are the screen color ringtones	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i i this slick phone and very happy with it am bought	1
while was very impressive of paid by was i than off the ease put what more i the price about use amazon for this player	1
mp beautiful optical challenges takes absolutely that by far easy stamp zoom x of the above mp cameras with detail to photos a of and least last and add on comes with great software options approval of features and all not is received my fiance lot understand but use	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
i it so is tall laying up ended on its side it	0

one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
my first impression was positive	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
phenomenal this is router	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
you see lens the in the view finder barrel can	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
very light and portable also	1
it has a nice color screen	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
others refuses certain with no problems on to it episodes on dvds play the so far on the dvd	1
also the song information feature to put automatically is nt always accurate in the	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
through a to the crew was support the amount answered however reasonable a phone call in d and they guided problem of time link process without a me	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
is from apex literally tech support nonexistent	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
there best point digital is the the simply camera out this today at g price canon	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
these speakers are great	1
has all sorts of problems the player itself	0
recommend modules and the getting highly the wifi bluetooth superdrive	1
the is easy to use is to just velcro straps the mount tie up it on handlebars	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
do buy this monitor nt	0
is trash this thing	0
tech got actually very pleasent and helpfull was you support once someone	1
second the lasted before went out the video about two weeks	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
volume have excellent hearing but on i is the this phone level especially quiet	0
user replaceable battery	1
it is worth it	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
good is brightness really screen	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
but keys the layout close together are to it a bit funky in and relation standard rectangular layout keypads is the is not too weird	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
your support apple your though products is equal to that of superb quality kudos are	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
love i about it fact in my carry it i forget shirt or pants pocket and can the	1

i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
annoying spent considerable time with i professional video gear find onscreen displays having	0
the camera is take this past week fact a recent trip on a picture asked was to in very easy to use i of a vacationing elderly group	1
the image quality is excellent	1
acer to match and has have they a miserable repair facility their been awful to deal with treat their customers like rubbish products	0
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
this is it think i is biggest flaw	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
i i myself d tell the to you back to the store but waiting go got so my experiences never router far enough to try this	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1

i do like the only thing nt about this is the cover does suck	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
an excellent phone overall	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
then worked perfectly week for came it the problems about a	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
the longer battery greater life accessibility sensibilities and pc compatibility are to online music services	1
wire joints excellent black finish ups speaker precise very tight and hook	1
giving technical support stars was responsible for my the technical support phone line	1
this system is very powerful	1

excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
keypad well backlit	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1

i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1

price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
got started and to we to when chapter the frames tried the finding nemo dvd we freeze for no reason	0
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1

customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
minor complaints option unavailable even is sorted d i via on the player the music the is to search for music contained in a folder tag though	0

it i all the dvds great and is rented have for running	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
my its widescreen wife to due even more pleased is	1
portable	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0

is amazing the battery life	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
one is excellent suspect from would creative as a the sound product	0
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
my first impression was positive	1
no longer was an awesome player before the video worked this output	0
the sound quality base poor been we day one the now has in the and constantly to it there calls with of short circuit drops some sort be base no longer can seems the ac the base since adapter or use turns off completely	0
me impressed the disign the specs really with it the price	1

however you you get what do pay for in reliable products	1

is is the battery life and ipod excellent excellent cheaper battery the that is replacable is excellent the sound the the price gb than fact the finally is excellent	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1

this player seems with work fine everything to else	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
is amazing this product	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
protective case completely useless as is since display window obscures it	0
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1

i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the capacity zen the is need for your music collection a convenient data storage device in other words buy not you only	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
and included are awesome i did mention they were polyphonic the ringtones	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
the nt on top of it if you your not hear sound ca but is clear and clean a thing	1
my dad also was for the money an apex tv has it another value and great	1
they are not wowable good	0
it came well packaged	1
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
fix i ve already emailed responses and if will gotten timely but they about creative tech support it it for me necessary	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the acer monitor will not fit in screen bright and an area lrb allows has an its design from a heighth perspective rrb that the placement extremely in many screens	0
is to connection the device so easy	1
and subwoofer has terrific sound the gets really high	1
has a major design flaw this camera	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
perfectly works for great product my office	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
overall great speakers	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
easy to pair	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
now however own it t without it i imagine i can being that	1
for a quality tower speaker you looking if is it this re	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
fine negotiated the router and the switch just presented the speed with a gige link	1
have may work seems to it re you only been five feet away from the player that if just the batteries although about in addition that came with it	0
i sound good and them in my office using they generally am	1
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
to is serious it has features but easy for beginners to use more grow into will love so that is photographers it an excellent camera	1
i suck would it invest feature some cool ones the since has headphones eax in	0
is sound you go are looking for wrong if what ca with these nt a good in a small package you	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
i m delighted with this product	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
times not overly sensitive at is sensitive others enough at the scroll button	0
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
the speakerphone i better had any speakerphone than ve works ever	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
and everything the colors are great	1
music mediasource software if ok to rip before are starting from scratch bought and my cds i but i creative musicmatch catalog rip you to burn is the zen used guess what	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
the amount besides so for is a i paid this speaker fine the annoyances	0
with bought with coolpix of along a mb ultra flash card as expected immediately happily found that qualities a you added convenience this m m pixel fine combos camera recently and are are many i see excellent of very similar to slr models digital with that the user friendly functions can of the picture and pictures	1

quite heft a construction in general has the the bit after plastic a disappointment of the stainless steel of body and s	0

for individualized ringtones d i caller no option or pictures	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the buck is most bang out there for it the	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
x zoom is nice	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
all is is products to the applies product not limited this the zen it to support feedback on creative is universally poor is company	0

this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
