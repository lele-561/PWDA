in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
while there are problems with the area because of its location	1
how this model works	1
it does have most of the features but there are gaps	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
its because it works for me period	1
the keypad is a decent size but the screen is small and hard to read	0
no graffiti all over my house it is located on the beach and very quiet in the city	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
looking for something with it on the rocks	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0

its great	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0

i was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they thanked me again thanks thanks	1
thank you mr trump and for the opportunity	1
all this man has is the knowledge that the woman can kill the him herself by herself and in the future	1
these are the best selling albums listings to online music services and retailers	1
i thought i should update the app but it turns out it only works and works by default on for apple computers	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
picture gallery is offline	0
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
the sun is very bright and the clouds are very good so that it is no more than about feet away	1
it will change and not you	1
other than this there is nothing	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
its bigger than me its bigger	0
it is used for the following	1
it was hard to get up out of the bed and i cried	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
this is more than what im doing this week at work this more depression depression	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
i have been working on it and looking at it and while it does	0
a wide range of colours and best of all the price	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
please take care of yourself before plopping down for a nap	1
the player itself is	1

there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
i picked up my notebook at the store but i do not mind buying notmad	0
my other favorite thing about this book is the	1
i am but i and i am	0
this is what its got going and its awesome	1
it depends on the router to be used for either or both	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
my mom uses this computer she is a teacher so she has a small computer that keeps her from crying	1
i am very happy with it so far	1
much better than my previous acer one netbook with the same screen	1
it is and has been for the last to few years i have had it	1
i have found that this is helpful if you have questions	1
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
see if you can find the dvd here thanks and thanks	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
i can easily take pictures with no visable loss in quality and not use the same as before	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
all i have to say is that it is sad to see but it is too	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the monitors are	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i send them a message and they come back saying undeliverable	0
i had fun in the first round in each of my games	1
i i can t understand why people are upset they are angry	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
honestly i love this player	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
i really would use this router in my or home	0

it sucks but i love you all of you that you arefrom	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1

the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
this is a list of events that have occurred	1
after a couple of days in the house of course i am ready to see them and to when i will see our other kids from at t	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0

dr seuss has a sound	1
in india it comes with a price	1
fragile	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i was waiting for the call and then it came	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
there are a lot of options and add on options with zoom and zoom but by far is stamp is stamp mp with optical zoom and with detail that challenges all to see and see	1
note indoor shots with flash are not as good as outdoor shots http www npr org sections photography npr photos with flash not as	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
the build is so solid it does nothing or nothing and the build and the	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
my mother told me it will be something on which i meditate or at least	1
stereo reproduction is stereo reproduction is stereophonic reproduction examples	1
its bright and very light inside and it works a charm too	1

the brightness is set with presets and the user can i set that at for at all	1
i have my thumbs down rating	0
the bible for you does not provide you with wisdom but rather after it has been tested by all the experts in the world	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
it does seem to work and should be of use for everyone	1
be prepared for a long lrb session but it was fun	0
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
it is very easy with which you will find	1
i have all of these and they all work	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
it is very nice and very small and very quiet	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
this has nothing with what it is and if we believe it will be when it did not exist	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
the sound is heard as if from a distance	1
they are easy to use and they are cheap	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
no wonder it has happened why not now	0
this thing is awesome	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
there is much which has been said about the film of course it is all out of date	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
i wish you the best and hope my review helps feel free to download and play	0
at least what i found was a link which allows me to download any book from my collection https www youtube com watch v xcfkpy y w feature youtu	0
my other blog is here which is better than this	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i would recommend this monitor hard to beat for buy now	1
this is the best i know and they deserve to win for it	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
its cheap and it comes with a remote control	1
i just made it up myself which is very cool	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the quality of materials	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
now there is one i have about me and that is that i for sure i only wrote in it and i was happy with it	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
i found it impossible to find among city parks in my area so too the little park was closed	0
this router is the best i have used to date	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
this is not true the which comes first	0
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0

i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
picture quality is excellent	1
and yes there is something about that	1
it is going to take for a while for me but it has to for me to survive	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
this post came from https www expressmilwaukee com wp content uploads sites web img jpg	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
what i have bought since i was born	1
my first impression was positive	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
it was affordable very easy to learn and use he said its great related images	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
im giving it a try lets go through the process of	1
you can do other things with it such as as of now you can do	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
awesome sound quality	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
if you want to comment on this post	1
the problems that come with it are obvious	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
this is super easy to do if you have time click through here	1
the phone line was disconnected for my family	0
i think the problem with it is and	0
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i find the rest of it on here	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
high quality picture and video	1
the fact that the battery kept going off on the bottom latch	0
the second set is working just fine	1
please be prepared to wait until every time you need one more and click that button again thanks	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
i have had problems with the internet	0
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the only complaints i have with it are it is expensive it is a bit of a mess and it is annoying	0
i think it is the same i agree with these guys filed under	0
there is hope there is hope for anybody and the world	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
when you see this picture in person you know it is there it is real and so true	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
the author is on twitter	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
i think it was because it was not to be at all	1
so so off i went to buy a book and this book did the trick i needed	0
because it can refer to	1
the problem is that it does not work when battery dies	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
it is not	0
screen was good easy to read	1
i highly recommend it	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
you have to wait and see when i wake up when i want to sleep	0
but i told them about it and they said they will fix it for me if needed	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
with this the menus are different and the layout of it is different	1
we have more but they will be if you follow them on twitter http www twitter com david mccormick	1
both of the problem dvd is lost during playback while playing on the computer	0
it is located in and has a monument to it	1
i highly recommend it	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
i found the music on the cd to be useless for my money	0
screen was unavailable	0
it is worth it	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
you can then drop it to your player and play from there to your playlist	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i have lived here for a few years and have had no problems	1
for the sake of this article i will not comment	0
do not buy this player	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
i think it means which it does not of	0
this is what on a recent trip this year i was able to take of a friend	1
portable	1
speed means fast data transfers	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
very nice and are a big plus too	1
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
overall i like the unit	1
i am proud of this and put it into practice	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
and with that you can get to work over the weekend enjoy	1

the world has changed but only because it did but there are problems with that you know	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
what really happened this week was this	0
i know it is very numerous but it just works	1
this is a i and it does not operate mechanically as you think https www google com store apps details id https a fwww youtube com ewww	0
the answer is not to say it is easy to pick up on it	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
i am very happy with this and the way it was done	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1

this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
now you have to get the link cable to work its expensive and you cant	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
but a sturdier more efficient carrying system would be better	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
and it works great too	1
the car is equipped with a lot of features for such a small unit	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
the skies in the area are cloudy and somewhat hazy if you try to take photographs from a distance	0
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
no more or less these would have been nice extras	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
this article is not endorsed	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1

i think that it is a good thing for the u s government	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
i like to listen to music and can play any song etc	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1

while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0

good for speed	1
i was surprised when he said you get it from him he was right	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
my parents were not with me of the i	0
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the pictures are on the right which i like because that is where it is when i look at the pictures	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1

its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
they are in my opinion and i have not seen any evidence	0
the sound quality is excellent the sound is replacable and the price is reasonable	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
i can t see it now only because when it happens it is gone	0
this is a developing story and was not up to	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
images from indoor were not so good	0

p s sorry and this can be a problem for older downloaded files with older versions	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0

the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1

one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
the storage capacity is great	1

way less expensive than the ipod	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and i for a while	1

while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the major and minor keys are and	1
when it happened i called support	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
but there is something that i do know and i wish that i were over it for what i know	1
this is what and where it is	1
other than the fact and i would do this all over again	0
but i would like to	1
i have tried to contact them through their on line chat and email but they wo my my life is busy	0

i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the usb port on my laptop is dead	0
ive been researching and found a great site as well for my needs i was hesitant given the price but i found	0
it seems to work to me i have tested it which does not that well until you are in rrb that is about as it as it works for me without rebooting rrb	0
as i said the software is actually working despite what i have said above	0
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
it is just such a beautiful thing which you know	1
the included earbuds were not included	0
set up wpa with no problems	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
my only complaint is that i used tag data from the ripping to populate it	0
no dead pixels on the screen	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
what you see is what you get nothing has changed	0

lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
it may not happen at all or it no matter that the	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
the problem is that it is difficult to do so and will not work	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
silverish color also adds color	1
but it is not	0
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
i did it i did it but the rest just kind of sucks out	0
the grain was terrible	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
great price	1
it also does not have voice over dialing functionality	0
they deliver on when and actually when	1
it boasts a large size and weight a relatively simple interface that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound call it the best	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i want to help and it needs to get through to their mind	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
we are happy with this and more	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
it is and is not associated with any or all good qualities	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
it was good for the first and a half and then	1
i can not comment on my blog sorry	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
this player needs to go with someone else	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
this is great if you have kids and you can take the kids with you and take care of them	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
this is by no means in order	0
the system is used with respect for the selection of candidates having to be	1
i will not mess with my universal remote control	1
i like the low zoom but onfull size high zoom the results are quite bad	0
the girl who rocks my socks spills milk but does nothing	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
what is the problem	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
it took me awhile to get used to the navigation but it is a very nice	1
so just to let you know this is a freebie and you can comment on it which is great for all you readers who love to comment	1

creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1

this post can not be reposted for the following reasons	1

it would just be me and him	1
while the rest of the connector is	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i do not what other people but it is true	1

technical support rude and unhelpful	0
