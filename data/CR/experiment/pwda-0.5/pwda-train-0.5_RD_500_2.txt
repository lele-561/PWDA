if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
all that	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
simply the canon is out there at this price point	1

the phone great i do nt have any complaints about that voice dialing	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
makes for fast transfers	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
