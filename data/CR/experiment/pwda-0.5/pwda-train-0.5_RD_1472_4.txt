features are like the radio	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
do buy this	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
as a non technical person i was to the plus wireless hotspot less	1

player blows away with features is to understand and use and a great	1
when went it again there sound no picture	0
means is good that this not break easily like	1
pictures wo nt transfer directly using the included cable	0
of customer service am delighted to drop them and look forward august when will to	0

i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
also very set up a route to the as netgear	1
looks	1
i love fact i my pocket and	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit cool screen easy to read and the battery means a major advantage	1
it is worth it	1
excellent maybe times when are quieter talkers on the line	1
however since i in an office i normally them at a pretty low volume and at sound a little weak	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
takes excellent photos	1

unfortunately after loading is player either not connected or	0
the shutter and getting the settings i was stopaction photos contrary to reviewers experienced	0
when the comes out one super	1

excellent sound i music faithfully through the jukebox	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
bad but is	1
i wo into the details here but pleased with speed the picture quality flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this offers	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
device is i would recomment it highly	1
this router does drop a while but did or	0
so use your regular pair instead	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
so off i went get a faster router this one for admirably	1

this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1

wrong with thing	0
the usb port on a nice	1
click buttons buttons display very easy to access	1
it very cool small to me and	1
its more select to on playlist as the new ipod mention it does with numbers ect like the ipod	0

i using in my office and	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
the screen freezes and shows	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
on my screen but as clear as when view them on my monitor	1
the speakers no question about it for the size range what expect from speakers lrb perhaps than rrb	0

this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal	1
looks if play your real	1
i bunch formats if play and it	1
are what you can do because the built in crossovers	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1

for specific location i still think its a great phone	1
is sensitive	1
be for a long wait minutes the wait was worth it	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1

it	1
the canon g for but has an that makes it for the to use	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
this probably one the few dvd players at that can play almost you throw at it	0
player was working it	0
ok	1
however the reason satisfied with this product is the fact that it lock	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
the technical support line my giving	1
that the headphone jack unique so	1
for its and word docs is more than acceptable	1
without to go taking all the would be far better	0
others may have better luck a flat panel with such horrible viewing	0
they re stay in deliver a decent audio quality	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
the g a can and fortunately for i the external flashes that money	1
this my labs player it	1
minor highly the canon g who is serious about digital photography	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
it worked great pluged it in	1
zennx was the deciding factor my purchase zennx ipod	1
am happy my decision	1
packed	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
what it was the deal	1
the device pretty	1
range of it everyone advanced functions for are serious photography	1

the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
and programmed for preset fm stations	1
kudos to the zen music quality using	1
the tech support they me but this did	1
very compact and portable as great sound quality	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1

for this being to use with well laid out controls be learned quickly	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
it made changes to the router we to press turn on the work	1
