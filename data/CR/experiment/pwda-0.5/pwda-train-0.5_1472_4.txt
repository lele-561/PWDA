the has to be in only  downside that it is a long shot is the remote which requires a lot of power a line of sight	0
the when turned the phone screen is i hit how good is me that the first thing on	1
i have excellent hearing but loud the volume level and i am used to on this phone is on my ipod especially too loud for me to be quiet	0
