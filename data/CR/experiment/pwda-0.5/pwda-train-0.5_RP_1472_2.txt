maybe they should have gotten out of dodge and put some money on the table maybe	0
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
the sun comes up every once in a while	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1

i have now had it for months and i am pleased	1
i have had the opportunity for this and i am very grateful	1

it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0

i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
the quality is very good	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
it works and does what it says	1
there are exceptions but not many thanks for asking	0
the camera is inches and has a led backlight which is the better than inches it is better than the previous model	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
its also not a bass for which you need a bassmaster you have a very good and	1
it does help when you have the time	1
there are times when i wish they were able to do it but it will only be if you just have and you will be happy and that is it but you and you can do more than to be	1

i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
but it had precision but no precision at all	1
they deliver on when and actually when	1
it is packaged	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
but i would like to	1
but the bass is pretty good from such a small bass	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
i love to play and can find any playlist easy enough	1
the company is even more pleased thanks to its customers he said	1
this is a very light device a tablet with a battery pack	1

i was hoping that it but there is no reply	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1

anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
they are fantastic	1
it has the advantage of being very easy to use very fast and fast and	1
the sound is good and i am still happy	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
but it can t be all of the time it can t	0

i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
if you had the fm app or just having it at home you would be happy thanks	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
while my laptop and netbook are on it is better than making it unusable	0

the difference between less than that is a good achievement for a hard drive based system	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
they fired away and it worked	1
it does have most of the features but there are gaps	1

without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
sounds like a good product	1
i have numerous different monitor models i use and this one had as good of picture quality as any i have	1

the prices are reasonable so just buy your own pair too	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
its solid although not very solid as it is solid its solid and uses a lot	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
this thing is awesome	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
when i saw i knew that the people for sending me were there	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1

it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
as if it should be a bit more complicated	0
i want to be famous for writing in a book period	1

i have all of these and they all work	1
it is very old and was built up in about	1
they are really good just as well	1
i have been reading on and the urge to do so	1
i think i did a lot of review and editing thanks	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
they are not the same	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
i was told that it was more like	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0

this article and the citation for it and word count is below enjoy its contents	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
it is used and used	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0

this led monitor is fantastic	1
i am and they are	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
again the numbers were low and far from where they should the rest of the time	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
we have confirmed on twitter that the report has not and is not if you as the author	1
great deals and features	1
it has a few flaws but only because it has those flaws and theyre minor but there are very few problems with it that you cant solve this way to do	0
i checked out the amazon site and i found to be mine worked out fine	1
