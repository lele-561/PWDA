is easy to read the manual is easy to understand and i think use it is simple to use and understand what is going on it is mostly idiot proof	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
change the sound with the presets you can make with also use the presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with itchange your sound with different it you can do it yo eax on  a lot of different sound  you can modify your sound with different   it you can also use the presets which is  pretty good you can get different variations with it	1

overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
my first impression was positive	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
