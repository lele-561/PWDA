what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
and but everyone love amazon hate apex i tell i	0
the other controls all very easy to use	1

this wonderful gift was given to me	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0

its great	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the as good sound level is also not far as as high as good as can be but as would like as i would like to be the level is also not far as as high as best as can be but as would like i would have expecte i would have expected	1

great colors pictures and white balance	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1

this type of product device is too fragile for strong normal use	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
