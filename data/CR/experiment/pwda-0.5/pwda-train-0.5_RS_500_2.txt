convenience because it works through the usb port	1
port it usb convenience through the because works	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
great phone i d buy another	1

you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
the software entire is quick easy to use found the very easily mastered i process	1
i so am products that never product quality i service recommend is would of netgear customer netgear tired to anyone i know	0
headphone the be seems jack to a major problem	0
open up mediasource the player to connect your computer as stored can listen to stream from the xtra s your they and directly you mp	1
find for i pretty easy to use and unlike it the remote interface the audigy nx	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
low light situations an not have to auto focus assist allows does which nice for taking it in shots it light camera the is focus in low light	1
the the positive side the is you player have everything configured once pretty good sound of on	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
also the ipod it a lot less than costs	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
at minimum brightness brightness four that with is for at night rrb i leave changeable easy and one user changing lrb presets	1
i only its what more affordable is is a not player better which for windows it have but	0
days the quit working the sound worked but but video after	0
seems like a good product	1
the usb port nice is the a back on feature	1
its unresponsiveness with miss precious shots you g camera is that the catch canon will to the cause	1
usb are transfers through surprisingly quick	1
as a whole fine and works has a sleek design the dvd player	1

my only significant complaint sound quality is	0
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
i fizzled i but just every did nt abuse it the headphone charged jack day sort of it out	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
in even m as pictures to x possible no visable loss i picture quality and not easily setting the best using with yet enlarging	0
so with as ugly all software yes useless was and it bundled with creative products	0
for years comparable to been or than slightly worse linksys the old possibly router i range was using had	0
service from the supplier the was exceptional	1
this that chance there a typical american phones good that break will this phone not means easily like is	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
of devices that they a whole bunch have all have the same sounding name	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the zen you do of your tracks have tags it and they all if into the same ll not lump as can nt does via recognize or artist be album searched not directory folders	0
i ve viewed i ve numerous different monitor models had and particular of picture quality monitor as as poor this since any i seen m a college student	0
little a fine but weighty otherwise	0
not enough overly the scroll button at times sensitive sensitive is at others	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
i bought this slick phone and happy am it i with very	1
will about up be feet you to can from it and still away it work perfectly	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0

the sound well there and is no complaints about that	1
operation the other netbooks with windows starter was with allow mention this instaled flawless with the increased memory option does nt otherwise and nobody the windows home professional	0

better even the linksys on g band than works	1
color better like not is but i is terribly nomad the flashy it	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1

if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
the remote and flimsy feeling awkward to use is	0
for the first three hours by this very inexpensive player impressed then and i was it died	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0

the g to use very comfortable and friendly will find those used mm cameras to	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
it is very solidly built nice to and it dense a has feel	1
all i can say that is is an excellent devise this	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
but this dvd player probably dollar for dollar is the best out there	1
very intuitive a big plus are on this camera menus	1

i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
ring tones close come and sounds that crazy songs there is only ring with annoying rings only one to a regular ring	0

silverish color really adds a special touch	1
battery is ok life	1
easy to remove the nomad sound plusses are produced the and the terrific by battery	1
also i lists t the cds when understand the software ignore not the does it can why in alphabetical order	0
