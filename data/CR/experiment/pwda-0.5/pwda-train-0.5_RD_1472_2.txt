feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
it sounds great the or my night	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0

dead pixels	1
but is not in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor	0

software which is all	1
after it just a month i not play any dvd	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
contrary to ive g sync at of a second flashes as it does with from canon	0
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
pc cable is too expensive a usb cable	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0

creative are people computers i can t understand why static	0
the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0

although the sound is good more than good sound on a portable to in a good product	0

is	1
this product is amazing	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
is a feature e early in the morning and rather listen to than no problem	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
but can really expect much out of you	0
there is good chance that this phone break typical american	0
did nt get any from the side speakers like with old	1
material is on the cheap side	0
operating features is easy and obvious i m annie was to figure out of its abilities just at a camera store	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
the problem with this box that it reboots an hour if more frequently	0
the second set working just fine	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
it easy use	1
the price performance looked just right	1
all in all good option for who small wants and external speakers	1
can manage your profile of display either list or tabbed	1
it i can listen to music anytime	1
have found that very easy to use have a basic knowledge of a computer	0
the firmware and os control this thing ready for prime time	0
it like burning plastic	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
happy with the price	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
nt like on nt secure and can off	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
that digital outputs the latter mentioned scanned before buying	1
has worked well	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1
nt want one i would have in myself that is a pain rrb i did alot of research read of reviews i m purchased	1
otherwise monitor for	0

these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
i have several times to their on line site wo nt answer their telephone line	0
crystal clear as well	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
apple though products your support is to that	1
i highly recommend it	1
selected the right away and have high quality pictures	1
its x optical is acceptable for shots	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
not have is nice shots in low light situations	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
looking is n router you will find today i am this on nov rrb	0
the memory is staggering	1
sound wonderful in my opinion i touched equalizers	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
see having issues with it year however do will know that be and quick and courteous customer service reps service amazon in and it is exactly what knew	1
got a error problem days after purchase	0
several elements simply did at all	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
very bad	0
play order of album shuffle etc is on all jukebox players but noting that is not in this	0
sound quality is good	1
nothing this company	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1

monitor to and works as promised with	1
buttons do seem little sticky tho the hands free connector might be problem	0
as however not difficult to use horrible	1
very portable just described	1
in words convenient data storage only buy capacity you need for your music collection	0
has a wonderful set	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
come it explain how	1
is you little children you can always the camera you take many pictures of them	1
protective case completely useless as since display window	0
avoid the plague	1
fragile	0
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
the mediasource not work on my pc	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
my dad also has an apex tv and it great value for the money	1
is no guessing	1
i do nt	1
for	1
larger than the previous model the nx has a bright blue which illuminates more successfully than	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
this little speaker	1
i had problems getting to two of favorite	0
nearly pictures have found this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
very long lasting battery life	1
having spent with professional video gear onscreen displays annoying	0
crystal clear	1
both black and the white speakers economically priced and worth it	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
the camera the minutest	0
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
no format	0
weighty but otherwise fine	0
i was hesitant but impressed since receiving it bought for parents	1
good	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
the earbuds that come it	1
is small	1
the editing software with is but very robust	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
monitor very well a sharp display	1
are flawed	0
i any distortion problems with this phone and than used before	0
was answered	1
b takes for on my pentium with	1
it would either song all or no that was	0
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0

i the and it	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
screen brightness is really good	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
i m happy speaker	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
this to anyone looking digital does take weeks out how to	0
this and commands	1
it and does everything	1

really me the disign the specs the price	0
to serve as for is a huge plus	1
otherwise	0
very long lasting	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
is by far the finest camera in price category i have ever used	1
great they buzz them sound turned up	1
my fiance this computer she is a teacher so she needed that her home	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1

navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
other sound is and i would this	0
the to an external drive is from my various computers	0
the scene mode well remainder of	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
spent hours on could nt connect to internet	0
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
keeps the volume at the same level will come in handy when i	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
the lens barrel the view	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
my dad an tv and for the money	0
would either play at all or skip matter the unit was resting	0
purchased of these acer very good rates from amazon are pleased clarity and	1
bought along with as found that of the picture fine combos and many of the user friendly functions very similar models and with added convenience of a digital camera can see pictures immediately	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
others may have better luck but i seen a panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
lcd	0
the hands someone does nt	1
is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those	1
have experienced	1
the radio function which	1
getting good value in	1
beautiful crisp defined mids and respectable bass	1
did corectly from the start the week before it started to act up	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
is like others here disconnects from the bluetooth it is when it does because it does so often	0
while cellphone was fully determined buy only it is the best in cellphones	1
tried the finding nemo dvd got to chapter	0
the instructions that come do	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
but documented in the neither the hard copy nor	0
gave the zen stars it is excellent for it and it to rate based on	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
tried fm transmitter unit i it top of a portable radio but was to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
comes with wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
which time failed completely	0
manual a job filling in any blanks	0
i ago i very with it far	1
camera is mind blowing	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
it seems that with release better	1
this my	1
and it does not show	0
d buy another	1
easy to pair	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
harder use ipod have even at the beginning did not think would justify the in price	0
runs through the body giving it a very clean	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
screen is good	1
tried a hold apex who nt and constantly busy the service	0
for personal preference	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
product	1
great camera and for the price you beat	1
giving kudos to the zen i experienced a flaw using eax	0
this is a great little phone its great ergonomics and tiny	1
equipment included that since s not what	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the sound quality is very good	1
not volume connected	0
it most bang for the buck	1
i got this for on my truck i m for the it is loud and you are want an amp for i	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
i grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the second set is	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
you want a product delivered time buy	1
looked	1
worked fine	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
the is stiff	0
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
the bright to see in	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
this camera and recommend it	1
the technical line on the other hand very helpful	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
you different things such can see the interface modern or classical	1
the feel and layout of the remote control only so it does nt the complete filenames cycle every zoom before getting back to normal size	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
love this camera and heartedly recommend to a the medium price range	1
this player price recommend that	1
the life is excellent the fact that and finally	1
the quick easy process	1
the are top notch	1
you see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
amazon was wonderful picking the next day for	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
day dark the colors and brightness across i look the the corner	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
the creative labs zen xtra the i has you get if from your only to pay for great player	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
and layout is a bit funky to standard rectangular layout keypads not weird	0
my but nt wash my car	1
also you can data on it is a for all you people to buy an ipod just say have an ipod do bother	1
my blu ray live normally back smile up perform well forever thereafter	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
back buttons volume and display are very to access	1
this monitor a couple months ago and have been far	0
if you for a little fiddling may very this day forecaster	0
pc cable for a usb cable	0
wire runs the body of giving it	1
you have with as well	1
quite bulky although not very solid it	0
is high quality	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
you be up to about feet it and	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
also navigating is unlike my player	0
playing these discs and all	1
other day i listening to a song it locked up and not	0
amazing	1
also but all i need is something to	0
video stopped	0
over all a fantastic very which made photography a totally new	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
my only complaint to date that it dropped the am why nt know if was something did if was of the router	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
is excellent except a tad too quiet at talkers	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone is serious digital	1
it is expect	0
i would recommend this product	1
this was very prompt	1
multiple play modes tracks order of album shuffle etc standard on players worth the zen xtra not	0
to buy was that said it would rs of files	1
not only it the perfect size has a phone user	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
protective case completely useless is it obscures display window	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
is average but nt since that s what	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
me a few tries get use the navigation it a player imo	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
have to really push this to the limit should from	0
in it is been weeks without a reply	0
great picture	1
the thing do nt this is the cover does suck	0
gave due to the the st one i dropped it fairly short	0
not only it functional and super smooth it is	1
great very few bad	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
found that a improvement	1
and the sound well is complaints that	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
great there still a lot	1
you have netbook expectations you will pleasantly by how well baby runs	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
honestly i this player	1
has unproven battery life	0
i ve had the nomad up	1
the software comes with	1
oh the screen saver feature is	0
looks and seems small to and	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services are the sensibilities	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s but what	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for a good sound in	1
received great when set up with s connector	1
the headphone jack be major problem	0
it played out of three dvd without problems the two being afflicted by a number of	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
the a it is as	0
overall i like the unit	1
i nt even touched any equalizers	0
a small college apartment e and were overkill	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
setup from programmed for preset fm stations under minutes	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
a beautiful design lots of features very to very configurable customizable and amazing	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
main problems for me is that dsub from the sub is too short	0
neither message was answered	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
well was nice while it	1
nothing but hassle	0
and i syncing player was easy too	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
nt play a lot of	1
player to work	1
nt say difficult enjoy	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
the is exceptional the pictures are and take the with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
as with all built in flashes in cameras get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
is nt be easier	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
however real intuitive	1
will respond my emails	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
is product is universally poor this to the zen applies the company products	0
also the	1
my two main requirements longer battery life and price	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
highly recommend the superdrive the wifi bluetooth	1
works better speakerphone	0
but not work	0
is okay can cause after about minutes	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
much larger	1
over files at the and random a job up	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
changing is easy with four presets and i leave minimum brightness for at	1
really this one	1
you can create playlists songs and playlists to your player and directly from cd to your player	1
remote and for photo capture is	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
i a jukebox it got being recharged they for usd look at it would for the	0
very to two different android phones	1
other is the headphone jack headphones	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
my desk	0
than the ipod but have use and beginning not think would difference in price	0
is easy	1
i have had the nomad for about three i am	0
of use and anything	1
guided me to which that failed negotiate the ethernet from optical	1
is not reliable and dropped	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
thing phone does have voice dialing	1
no grill protection to the driver	0
instance i made several back ups dvd movies it plays the dvds	1
for the price	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
excellent	1
i had for and i even more	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
this machine change your whole idea of laptop should be	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
within the	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
ll a lot because utilized by the software	1
with the increased memory option flawless the windows home professional instaled otherwise starter doesnt allow	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
good	1
closest than is megapixel	1
and the screen saver feature is pretty	1
i have stored around cd and have	1
having ever go is terrific	1
for once and did even go	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
sub is large	1
overall a good for	1
it but not as light	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
black wheel feels pretty	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
when it produced a cd but with dvd got the no picture	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
with still think it is the available under	1
a cumbersome to	0
about the speakerphone can only once you the phone while is	0
up well	1
that supports this device via software	1
not counting the i spent editing the was painless	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
it is real of walls but in my house perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
am able it close to my body in places where not	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
month the freezes shows no	0
front cover can pop mine case so i did notice	0
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
i am stunned and can with i never seen anything better within its resolution	0
i the apex ad	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
wo nt play a lot	0
chic look good build the player a compact form	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
size and weight of little critter	1
slow download and run certain programs you the best	0
it and	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
tried to three times with success	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
average indoor shots with a flash not	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
so has	1
small size speaker pumps great sounds with sansas and ipods	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
it	1
the system was nowhere near stable and was alpha stage at best	1
dvd is basicly junk	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
x zoom is nice	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
the player would my one dvds even though were damaged in any way	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1

the speakerphone the radio work perfectly	1
the only minor have with the camera are the lens cap itself	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0

recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0

also the feature automatically put the song information accurate	0
there much which has said in other reviews about the of this phone a great phone mine worked problems right out of the box	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
software awkward difficult and just plain load on some computers	0
bottom	1
it the router to be either for or server	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1

this player recommend that you do nt purchase it	1
i love	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1

at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
anyways to the point ve tried to so calm over dealing acer and their terrible service and support	0
last note i purchased this a higher price what in	1

i ve had this just over a month the jack has loose	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
is it worked	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0

the sound quality has poor since day one the calls and there short circuit in the base can use the ac adapter with the base turns off completely	0
features	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0

no problems dropped signals the netgear router it replaced only months	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the features are like the radio	1
now that have all my music on it there been	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
find the setting will give perfect pictures right out of the box	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
my only like others here randomly and it annoying when does does	0
very good value for the money	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle even	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the g looks like a work of art	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
i the size and weight of	1
is sorted via i option to search for music a folder is unavailable	0
first the cons a tad not the most asthetic looking and does support folder	0
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and	0
decided the mp resolution and	1

dollar for dollar is probably out	0
takes approximately to i it rrb sound that bad until you nailed times in one lrb is as as without rebooting rrb	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
replacement even worse than one which was now	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
the only thing m concerned about is of the on	0
mid range is nt the best but is there enough to satisfy not	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
speed tests the wireless were comparable my home wireless using my home cable as input	1
months it playing higher number scenes	1
to the other machines seems awesome than the router i replaced the of plus this makes for a great product	1
one that a pitiful card and for most purposes is not enough	0
having considerable time i find annoying	0
will have wholeheartedly agree with others here the quality of this speaker	0
question the sound range is what from	0
esp docked	0
they are clears and perfect to be	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
for these things and have	1
is very nice and although does	1
otherwise	0
is my lack of experience but found with this camera	0
without to go taking all the would be far better	0
one about you can only once the person you are calling the phone it	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
was willing to live with the larger size a big zero	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
and would go with creative labs	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the software the router is pretty good	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
software is	1
it is more than and the no matter what i do	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
it does voice activated big minus	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
overall	1
but it to so well now that any	1
goes off quickly and there no way change this	0
plays dvd is but has such as a dvd stopping particular a movie time played it not being able to access certain special features	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not matter except use it while running it in your pocket	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
it also has unproven battery life	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
i because from what i read it was deal for the money	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
great product for	1
really this is best	1
it enough to for a beginner it has of features for me to into	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
is a nice light non intrusive device take anywhere	1

my only gripe the hardware is	0
otherwise this player is awesome	1
main dial	1
the subwoofer gets really high	1
of the pictures	1
range of functions indicated it has something power plus advanced functions are serious about photography	1

however has failed	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1

capacity	1
the g had problems focusing in low light take picture shutter pressed been released	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1

another point note battery is	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0

other than the sound is and	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
tried to help but worked through a script	0
great unbeatable price	1
for this being to use with well laid out controls be learned quickly	1

the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
friends creative gave this thing good long battery life an price	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
this system is very powerful	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i m pleased with so here is	1
was answered	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
light enough to around all without bother	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
fixed speaker do	0

main backlit	0
great phone i d buy another	1
it does not even trouble properly	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1

the headphones but really expect much insert in	0
after about an hour it starts the dvd are dirty	0
is	1
you this is you i am writing this	1
you use a very expensive dsl as i returned item and got a dsl modem instead	0
no longer recognizes anything	0
without a doubt would say that have the same sound quality as the jbl and are truly portable be played outlet i	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
pictures are razor sharp macro	1
the is not good either and the driver	0
the is a tad boomy and o still even with subwoofer know the way but it because these computer speakers	0
works	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
has ll have room for new technologies	0
i am very pleased with it	1
i ve to this several different tvs using a multitude of methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
this	1
the screen freezes and shows	0
these speakers have they will buzz if the	0
i very with so here is a review	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
can difference this and of and viewing angles	1
wo my movies all store boughten	0
the things that have i live this since me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
my t mobile a	0
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
to that of stereo set there	0
the player to you can as stream directly from	1
they	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the storage capacity is great	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices achievement for	1
for the first few weeks this player i it affordable multi format player as	1
more than amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression to poor no doubt and expected get a good quality product these disconnects kills it	0
finally playlists from be because the tracks are listed individually and organized by are not listed organized	0
mediasource	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
canon software raw images present you with raw at all after processed the image settings	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
p does everything hoped for	1
is does it consistently	0
technology wise i think is awesome the speaker makes even great love this phone	1
conclusion i was ready pay the speakers the day i got them	0
the included support is at you as the equalizer you which a big hassle	1
the battery life seems good takes very time to it and is no delay between songs	1
continues	1
the lack support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having for this router was very unimpressed	0
a small portable unit this allows you as well as share ipod music and podcasts	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
it is versatile and seems be one best	1
lock up several times	0
these speakers amazing	1
if you to rename you have already become quickly	1
the nikon little camera	1
manage your different type of display tabbed	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
with the company	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
is the remote requires line of sight	0
am and looking elsewhere that can of	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the tiny remote unit is does it the also used and	1
other words the zen is data storage only buy your music	0
and it great	1
it	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
to in hour period is weeks a reply	0
the	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
what the focus lag time is the extreme depth of at	1
nt very	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the grain was terrible	0
difficult to change genre album information for large number tracks	0
well spent	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0

this phone ir just to one the view as the most beneficial	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
nt every day but just sort of fizzled out	0

have several times apex and their telephone line but answer my emails and their telephone line	0
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
when options sending via either text or email	0

this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0

i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
think	1
if it lump and they not be or album as the not recognize	0
i simply love this feature	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1

like is but	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
overall an excellent phone	1

phone has few because it lacks features bluetooth high spend but things that expected this	0
the attachment to flash	1
surprised the was and especially like use when i am listening to audio books	1
seriously this thing everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
simply this was created and left behind	0

simply the is the best digital camera today	1
works perfectly for my office	1
another is has audio though the literature i scanned before buying	1
machines but i consider quality low	0
of note the battery life is incredible	1
to more times than not so with mediasource	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
no propietary jack	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
manual is use fast for shutter speed and aperture to through menu options	0
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1

the nomad will the long run be best a gb hard drive one on can t create folders in companies never to buy products from again	0
gb of disk space	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
would recommend this in small buisiness environmnets	1
up and down magnification which there always a about quarter from top of screen interferes with viewing at settings	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1

my first was positive	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0

the infrared is blessing if transfer your old phone book me hours entering my numbers	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
i d you but waiting go so i never got far enough to try this	0

the canon software not you with a at all but image after it been processed all	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1

picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
