i am bored with the silver look	0
if this speaker tower for a quality looking re you is it	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
highly recommend beat monitor at point price hard to this this	1
for a price player very nice the it dvd is	1
very simple to use	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0

so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
great picture	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
about can of time it i the find t attach it to my pc the device when	0
track difficult to genre for large number of tracks album change information too	0
impressed five stars easily deserves m i electronics but to be a by conservative little this product really not tending	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
to is product so it is with small worked the real the product of corners my house and in my house but strenght all perfectly no judge rooms through a lot of walls hard signal in the interruptions	0

scroll the it say finicky but find most return the a learning curve is there that time for pressing success rate wheel users some the they new just right have works it so frustrating is they just of it device	0
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
make can be a bit challenging but do that like the inside pics instantly you focused perfectly need can this are nt when or very simple and effective camera delete pics you lighting adjustments not	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
another excellent creative product in all this all is	1
see can in the view finder lens the barrel you	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
is highly recommended otherwise phone this	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
after several to of t in convert hands t at t customer years i torture of will look forward when august service the to i our other family phones from at delighted to drop them and am mobile	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
with eax on your variations different you with different presets can which is pretty good sound modify get you can with it	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
hooked mbps to down and link extreme n up d to mbps connected speed to wireless the dropped	0
junk this dvd play basicly is	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0

i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
up was is easy and configure valet about minutes in to set plus	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
player was longer an this before the video output no awesome worked	0
the amazon instant videos competitive its on my i pros watch win could and hdtv home premium hdmi port lrb cost delivering great	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1

the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
to is serious it has features but easy for beginners to use more grow into will love so that is photographers it an excellent camera	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1

then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
