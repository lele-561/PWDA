the d link router	0
help to tell with a quick glance	1

the software	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
money apex machines	1
and it does not show	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
there so in this little yet powerful camera	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1

after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
i personally this router in or	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
is for you	1
the appearance is okayed	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
is too for a usb cable	0
portable	1
the screen a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
you myself experiences waiting to back to the store i got far enough to try this	0
too small it took like a half hour to to	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
looks fantastic esp iphone	1
life and delivers both	1
sub is large	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1

i office normally them at a pretty low volume at low volumes they	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
it	1
it like burning plastic	1

great sound very long life recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates great price	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
even cds full of jpgs	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
but than not of for something to work	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
remote is flimsy and	0
also has through our two story house	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
for me its the quality is	1
also the is hinged myriad positions or	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
even these shortcomings i still digital camera	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
i monitor computer direct a couple months ago and have satisfied	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
when	0
bottom camera to use features to ability external flash lense filters	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
the nicest phones nokia	1
the speakerphone better than i ve ever had	1
can	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the size is small	1
for	1
two phones for plan and one came with a broken headphone and died less than weeks	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
are great bike speakers the weekend the	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
it has of features very and and	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
space of songs	1
instance i made several back r it plays the dvds	1
and much audio	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
which with player good all	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
wheel is finicky it works of the time learning curve say have find it that just return the device	0

i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
but when to use again there	0
lastly i feel that speakers over for got lrb unless is the that do nt of rrb	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1

images	1
great quality picture and features	1
third continues with the case	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1

the included support is at you as the equalizer you which a big hassle	1
dvd not work	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
great camera great investment	1
color screen is a as are the polyphonic	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
software products which very dumb	0
i bought for to south it	0
delivery was prompt	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the battery life seems takes to charge it mp s there	0
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
also navigating is unlike my player	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
allows the usb to either	1
oops go and adjust it there	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the grain was terrible	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the remote is	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
is wrong	0
up	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
lost internet connection with the router internet service was when was the modem rrb	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the price performance looked just right	1
it is worth it	1
do people saying but software is	0
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
it	1
is easy	1
is good it takes to result in a good product	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
the video output quit	0
great colors pictures and white balance	1
i am my cd collection kbps wma files an good for mb free available	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
other sound is and i would this	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
another great misfortune crashes frequently screwed up does nt with	0
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
mediasource	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
ve had and it is best ve	1
are laid out normal is guessing	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the months i had it	1
i love	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from they of the tv	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the only m concerned about the buttons on the	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
the speakerphone the radio work perfectly	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
very compact and portable as great sound quality	1
very to two different android phones	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
the finest camera its price and category i have ever used	1
i not used i disapointed	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
i research settled on this phone because the option priced access to	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
i willing overlook those things as unit looks sleek and a myriad of features	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
it has inconveniences one the songs do not after another on a cd	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
the looks out on s video to a connection	1
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
router but will xbox we have you can never get than to the others are moderate very nice tried to to line if have a laptop you will this router	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
whether you jog for a or having lunch at the park you ll glad you fm radio	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the tiny remote unit is does it the also used and	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the to automatically is nt always accurate	0
p s seem to doesnt respond it may just operator error	0
not inclined to product again	0
am i called and deceptive back	1
the automatic key lock function	1
is	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
would have been if you could see the screen if button did the jack	0
scroll	1
better low light the times optical zooms gets just that much closer	0
at first i dealt as mbps was fast	1
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i was to it even if all other reviews already it was slow	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
has none	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
it great switch to see it on screen	1
of all calls unlike with sprint	1
is also although not anything like a surround system rrb there but really notice it when the display you own screen	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
after is hard to figure out	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
a	1
have and	1
seen any of digital pictures i very pleased	1
the operation with was with the instaled other netbooks starter doesnt allow mention this	0
do play this	1
this slim design puts out	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
it extremely light and dissapears	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
have ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
the sound quality okay but the eax cause audio after about minutes	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
which time failed completely	0
i two these players christmas gifts and bad	0
find it and unlike the remote interface for the audigy	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
this like plague	0
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
scroll switch	0
they are not wowable good	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
one more complaint have for processing only shoot in raw image mode first thing i did the cf with which gives raw images opposed	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
canon never fails to amaze	1
you just someone that is afraid and just want get online and play mafiawars and all day router great for you	1
is small bigger than the that this less expensive is used in the zx	1
i love this player	1
it has never worked	0
canon is optics are better processing algorithms	1
the quality is superb	1
the scroll wheel is easy and works for me however many that the is cumbersome difficult to operate	1
but you have the warranty you should swap it out	0
this little has dynamite sound	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
bunch of different formats to see and it	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
it is so small but big value mac	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
it then i discs that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i guess that a on the warranty	0

the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
a great system	1
the router recognized was breeze	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
can not be the audio	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
is supplied	1
have rated five for	1
this player and would go with creative labs again	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
in it you can t avoid that	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the g like	1
the finish is more mirror than silver and i it	1
surprisingly quick	1
no games it has cool not use it	0
the device i recomment it	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
to be better in	0
comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had	0
i got this use on my truck and m happy it the it super you are going i	1
there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars its affordability	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
loved the slim design	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
the a spent investment	1
is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
to was only one	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the phone is light and very attractive	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
tried times a of who nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number constantly busy is probably	0
more protective	1
i also you can custom you made computer	1
however i plugged my mac mini	0
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
a junk	0
for the first few weeks this player i it affordable multi format player as	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
i it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
all is a very good option anyone who small portable computer wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
this router is phenomenal	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
it	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
would	1
all that	0
well pleased the monitor	1
highly for great pictures yet take out how operate	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
overall experience with this monitor	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
zen sounds with good and well recored mp s	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
times but kept	0
after tries one of disks features not	0
a wonderful set of	1
either way can price	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
for most this	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
i wished could a little bit louder	0
the i have found i have nt is the lcd hard to is	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
the grain was terrible	0
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
is	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
is really	1
over the price this a unit	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
without a doubt would say that have the same sound quality as the jbl and are truly portable be played outlet i	1
was about day	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
the other day when i was listening to it locked up	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
it side side up down feature	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
good a huge array of features built	1
adjust the to anywhere or so it does that big	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
unfortunately loading is	0
it is small	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning sharp any camera i ve seen	1
battery	1
focusing on a rack about away in in a shade of orange	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
i of the adjustment options aperature priority light but the is relatively	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
it keeps telling	1
it is made of plastic	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
and have not had any problems with dvds not being	1
is unlike my canon fits in my pocket	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
player plays dvd is but not in a movie every time not being to on	0
are very it doubles as when you bored	0
is by far the nicest one in so many	1
huge for the price easy to can modify existing has a removable battery	1
bottom line is for these things sound great and tons of good bass	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
i purchased this phone for just and there is can it	1
considerable time with professional onscreen displays annoying	0
was only free shipping and no tax so it a decent player	1
mp players problem in the first	0
is upstairs downstairs outside or basement four bars all time	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
t rate it one star only because when it is pretty good	0
d link support was polite but just worked through a script was unsuccessful	0
because it hidden features i keep to non american region dvd	0
small size	1
which several long stretches	1
excellent	1
i have around cd is barely touched available memory	1
a sync issue	0
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
my dad an tv and for the money	0
the player would my one dvds even though were damaged in any way	0
netbook for my sales person worked and stop it works better than my own laptop so i will change to as possible	0
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
i called apex cust service help	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
the picture and the sound good	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
works	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to	1
customer nonresponsive tells you quality their products and their willingness stand behind them	1
one beef is the scroll it nt work as well d like	0
has been poor since day one constantly drops and seems some sort of short circuit in can longer with it	0
for is nothing better	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
prepared wait every time sub menu that dreaded button yes minutes	0
had phone the features were good sound and fm and	1
so far the router has worked well	1
memory is staggering	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen as directly xtra	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
the prints	1
it is an cool gizmo	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
i purchased am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
with their tech support you connected right away and have to wait rrb and got imac and macbook back	1
for the buck out there	0
last night i needed to reset the router	0
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the to an external drive is from my various computers	0
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
but about of dvd i ve played on a when a movie picture freeze but plays and eventualy kicks back after skipping	0
great speakers overall	1
delivers what must detail tonal and color response of view	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
as a portable player it a bit more durable	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
good battery life	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
me a few tries get use the navigation it a player imo	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
cost win home hdmi lrb i amazon instant videos on and its great	1
it has	1
i for almost two hours and the did go	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
price along replaceable battery were the main why i picked	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
without tweaking if realistic ever seen produced by film and a raw	0
it will read and play all audio disc	1
with some of the properties but now that equalizer have open sound card is control panel every time switch music videos games the is much more	0
frame freezes the family dad somethings wrong with dvd player come quick	0
this phone	0
this camera canon is great colorimetry you is what you	1
no matter the format	1
exceptional quality hd make good buy	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
of the price storage size and this player the on the market	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast continues to play as you left when were it	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
overall i like it	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size is rrb power adapter	0
the fm radio	1
love netbook	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
after we the problems we never got in touch with them telephone is they answer their web customer support	0
you do get what you	1
awesome	1
message was answered	1
is exceptional very clear and take with the lens close	1
another point of note the battery life	1
unit video output failed	0
for the price and features it is really good	1
mp player much more memory for much than an ipod	1
of reviews has mentioned about this	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels	0
the power on off key	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i the quality of the pictures	1
but pretty low	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
you can beat it	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
did supposed to so we re returning it we this our two computers	0
price gb of storage	1
is an excellent value	1
not plug play relies on i d no fm or recording	0
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
sharp	1
so	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
stands now pretty useless the player up for travel you up all your songs beforehand	0
apex is the get for the price	1
just right	1
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
was very pleasent and helpfull once	1
ring tones come rings there only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
this how it is unmatched	0
the battery life is amazing	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
key	1
this has that or expert amateur could want	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
while upgrading the connector broke	0
had focusing low take shutter after released seconds	0
the can when delete pics you do are not or need lighting adjustments make this very simple and	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
have the switch on the bottom that releases the player cover not been an issue for me and is immaterial if use the case the case the switch	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
having to go the netgear genie tool and taking extra steps	0
cheap feels break very easily and it would nt survive a drop	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
this is the best phone i have seen	1
is a good deal	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
impressed for hours then died	0
works	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
this i bought they to impress	1
and it works great too	1
with my sennheiser headphones is enough at	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
things easy to and the writing big enough	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
mode works for are not to be in a regular setting	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
are intuitive for a novice	1
this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
usually horns but hear anything	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
the with my usb still very quick and the	0
i and elsewhere for something business traveler	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
my and have volume on such devices inherently with speakers making hear some	1
great camera	1
best in class sound	1
i did from the side speakers	1
the problems came from my video card	0
i like of i would solely the apparent indestructibility it	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
i ve pleased with my	1
we two of lrb black rrb very pleased with the performance especially at low these	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
this phone is great whole like others with good qualities	1
one exhibited extremely speed going	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
really this dvd player	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the volume	0
included is average but that nt big s what buying for	1
i very with so here is a review	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
to chapter	1
give	1
wo nt play a lot	0
the a bit of a pain	0
there is also no height adjustability so it very low to the desk	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
player	1
with the i it if i	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
the hands someone does nt	1
i simply	1
so use your regular pair instead	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
is ok	1
the contrast crispness and readability even be beat	1
i will problems and the will worth it since will warrant which is totally ridiculous	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
picture is excellent	1
screen is very easy to read and bright but enough it does blind when you stare too long	1
well	1
i did the notmad software a ago and	0
also the player sometimes freezes very problem can be annoying	0
i ve had this just over a month the jack has loose	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
is top notch	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
usb port so you and network accessible storage	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
my two main and lower price found both	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
of the few phones have an fm radio tuner	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
all other buttons to touch and work well	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
the instructions for users but turns out it contained pdf of instructions offered nothing by way of explanation for apple computers	0
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
love this camera and heartedly recommend to a the medium price range	1
life	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
what a junk	0
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
extremely pleased with this router	1
even you disable securespot completely will keep is new even it is nt and force you to tell it that authorized	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the software is very easy to use minutes of opening my box i was any one of my cds	1
i love this monitor	1
some features in the user interface	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
overall i this stars as i ve seen the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over as only had the player for i room for if the headphone jack hissing problems up with me	1
the digital is especially useful if have little and many pictures of them	1
it nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
color and for my needs	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
in the hard drive died one morning before	0
but i	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1

but canon never fails to amaze	1
was somewhat but i think with the ipod well	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1

but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
second poorly designed	0
the mms is very well integrated with which you	1
but if ve used a slr mm camera	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
is amazing	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
like the nomad is but it is	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
now i it i can imagine being without it	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
good signal strength all over three house lrb is on the top floor rrb and very and security	1

the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
progressive scan player	1
the black fly wheel feels cheap uncomfortable to use	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
screen	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1

i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
i have not with all the camera easy to use get used to it	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0

the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
second set is working just fine	1
the software a for me at	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
really this is best	1
you starting with good things the screen big and the blue light in the back perfect fast as hell in music are easy after the scroll button great ve many mp players a ton of on here	1
to remove the	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1

nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
i can t why the when it lists in alphabetical order	0
but with low comes lower quality	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1

otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1

made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1

large defined and easy the silver unit	1
highly the superdrive	1
razor sharp in	1
the is	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
had little switch on the bottom nt impossible to select in my area	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1

my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
cons player nt folder stucture	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
read most dvds fine reads quietly	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
speakerphone	1
price	1
software the software is crap	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
is nt the best but it certainly and enough satisfy anyone not looking spend computer speakers	0
pictures is there are tons of have nt to	1
it gives great are easy use lasts forever on one charge the software is very user friendly it is it chrome casing	1
it lighter carry around has enough functionality to use	1
does	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
this is the best phone	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
the only minor have with the camera are the lens cap itself	0
no problems up the and getting cd	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0

with that expensive plans and horrible customer service seemed heaven sent	0
due to of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having the bones for this router was very unimpressed	0

not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
only con i can	0
this product and	1
was surprised the sound like to use when i listening to audio books	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
be there nt really the zen xtra can t you ve gotten comfortable with it	0

player will the glitches if there	1
this a good break easily like typical american phones	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
system is also very flexible	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
think this it is biggest flaw	0
i been do only better	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
they great sound a signal	1
the on off feels somewhat flimsy an awkward tiny that needs depressed to	0
is wonderful i really the smart normalization	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
the software sucks	0
some of i was to my computer in reclaim a internet	0
only stars to the broke i it from a fairly short distance	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
lrb use a new very expensive modem i and got linksys instead	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
that the battery poping off	0
great phone i d buy another	1
price was the lowest d seen lrb office depot rrb	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
the internet functions phone and work t mobile is services because menu would the phone to a different	0
when it use for my daughter is graduation party the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the explorer program shut a couple times and but to or anything open up explorer again	0
bad but is	1
overall nikon is dependable robust and useful little	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
once crank the volume a little to a level bit for work i to get done with some background music viola audio is great this relative great for rrb	1
the computer and was outrageously fast	1

difficult to change genre album information for large number tracks	0
the zen lets	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
easy enough but it	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
not volume connected	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
capacity	1
propietary	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
are that bad	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
up and down magnification which there always a about quarter from top of screen interferes with viewing at settings	0
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0

halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
fragile	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
overall an excellent phone	1
it	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
very simple to use	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
easy to use clear instructions contained	1

i was a the low end	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0

there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1

it it to see you re listening	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
ve sent to their department requesting with no response	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
protective case completely useless as since display window	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the player has minor for example of the time i have to turn off and again which not to my likings	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
asking for the xtra i researched mp players but decided on one and now and m convinced one out	0

before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
immediately the player to recognize	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
g the best digital today at this price point	1
highly at	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1

setup	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
it all the features tried a girl basketball game it want up to the task	0

this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
these speakers	1

other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0

amazing	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
i m happy speaker	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0

i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
clarity do and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
like this size and weight relatively that categorizes based on id tags excellent sound	1
this player price recommend that	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
features	1
guess but was right	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
selected it because looked easy to install	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
windows explorer windows the jukebox it to drop windows explorer to for the nomad	1
bought and i very happy with it	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
this has twice the short span of time	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
performs well i love the optional scene modes they are dummy proof correspond to which actually the	1
headphones suck would cool ones has the eax feature	0
looked into buying an that more the of features and seemed to the that category	0
my only like others here randomly and it annoying when does does	0
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
does what it should	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
other things that miss and a standard mm headset jack	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
i	1
the quality	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
product works outstanding battery life nice screen which of house uses connectsd to network	1
it really impressed with price	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
range of it everyone advanced functions for are serious photography	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
they have a whole bunch of that all	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
there is an alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
stays charged for time and no more or hours at most	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
ad runs all the dvd media dvd and dvd	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
the hard drive i attached the was	0
one that a pitiful card and for most purposes is not enough	0
an excellent phone	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
the size	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
unfortunately can t play	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
poor visibility on the	0
but it to so well now that any	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
after hooking the thing that i put in	0
this is wonderful to your player	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
hangs on file transfer every once prompting	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
access to so much ever you is terrific	1
may but never with such angles	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
the is mechanics	1
the camera is a to operate but	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
this is extemely lame	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
the sound this slim design puts out	1
picture and	1
software failed repeatedly	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
i have experienced	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
they away and the picture turned	0
going a cellphone i was fully determined to nokia as it the in	0
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1

the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor all more	0
the is nice	1
vocals greater clarity with the ihome	1

the service from t mobile is very good too	1
very pleased with it so far	1
battery it eventually wears out you be able to buy another easily	0
great system computer worth every	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
possibly advantage fact the replace the him in the new	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1

excellent picture quality par with my pioneer panasonic and	1
is to use found the entire very easily mastered	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0

i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1

no fm these would have been nice extras	0

recently this coolpix along card found excellent pixel fine combos and are and added convenience you can see pictures immediately	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
also fairly good light in weight cons wo are paying this net book	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
easy	1
this is phenomenal	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
we this on it brand new performance can be expected for the machine specifications keep m extremely computer savvy my opinion to a lot of people	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
great very few bad	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
the sound	1
with eax on modify presets which is pretty good different variations	1
screen brightness is really good	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
that cheap little record sounded like carnegie hall	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
what a disappointment	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
the only complaint i when you push in to select you to push	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
easy to hook up	1

huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
the image quality is excellent	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
i probably buy for the front channels	0
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
the technical line on the other hand very helpful	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
faster previous netbook with single processor	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1

it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
have no the phone	0
creative zen feedback from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel about	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
i just purchased player to say that i love it	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
good looks	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
it came	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
the is stiff	0
again can be so that i it ringing inside my was already out on street	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
technical was responsible for technical support	1
picture was when set with	1
it very set up my wamp server the was exactly the same	1
to more times than not so with mediasource	1
the sound quality and is really great to carry of stacks of or	1
i had no problem the more expensive dvd r media is that players would play but to my surprise play media that had burned i could nt to work had	1
overall i	1
can which is a plus to buy you have an ipod do	1
despite being larger than the i say was small it	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
easy	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
i have to i m also impressed the user interface for playing	1
this unit was fine for the month	0
very nice comfortable does take some getting used to	1
cons	0
i work study travel	1
is it it all the features would want	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
however this camera	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
sound enhancement and the eq was a limited band eq	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
in easy use	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
i a sensationalist but computer incredible	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
it works	1
i were these my listening needs i giving i think they do the job most want them for	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
recent have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
easy to	1
me is not	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
when put you forget it is there is unbelievably oh so	1
honestly i love this player	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
worked great	1
works great	1
all and all am	1
if do nt ll into they can be album as	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
is travesty said	0
color screen is good	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
is extemely lame	0
volume level is ok	1
it slightly lighter than the g packed more features	1
like the system features performance	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
data rate is rather slow i use it occasional it does nt me	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
and it works great	1
bother it is still a decent size	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
will respond my emails	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
the problem with this box that it reboots an hour if more frequently	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
it has never worked	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
the camera the minutest	0
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
last note i purchased this a higher price what in	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
would	1
my first was positive	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i followed easy instructions the manual and once the router is login there is a work you use it	1
great camera great investment	1
sound settings can	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
price	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
a for di s and there is no firmware update	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
when he said you get mileage a	1
d that because it is low cost the best stereo costwise	1
my gut be at best portable hard drive one can t create worst in to buy products from again	0
spectrum to	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
functioned would not pass through	0
many features m most with at a camera store	1
i the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt it resolved all my problems	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
i hours and could connect to	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
has of problems	0
but the sound the video working	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
sure it and a different setting you	1
for is still less even lowest level able get this gb monster the best part as great as then some	0
software the software is crap	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
of such as eax and customization	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
it easy for beginners to use but features will love it is an excellent camera into	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
would a run well me the time	0
i m running in insulated gauge speaker and this thick wire even through groove the bottom of	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
the replacement was even than the original one which fine	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
keys and layout is a bit funky relation standard keypads but it	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
and seems to me very light	1
to	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
tech support apex	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
does i not play	0
a weight to it	0
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
counting i spent editing the songs the transfer was	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
am	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
format	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
g photo buffs but still has auto mode that to use	1
sent my monitor for for such a problem random my acer gd hz monitor	0
this is not neither the hard copy nor cd version	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
if you for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
storage capacity	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
phone has few because it lacks features bluetooth high spend but things that expected this	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
the canon computer software used upload manage your digital pictures the computer is and to	0
it life excellent downloadable java	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
audio however is almost completely useless made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
played around and am satisfied range i have too	1
no problem product	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it is mac	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
other than that this thing is great	1
quite simply the firmware the os control not	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
nice and compact	1
i they	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1

overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
speakers perform very well with the bass boost fills outs	1
great sound good replaceable software wake sleep timers play	1
is excellent as one suspect from a creative product	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
running all the have and rented	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
here the brief synopsis phone seems pretty sturdy	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
for i a	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0

what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
good as	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
correction is	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
i spend hours in vnc session with dark colors colors and brightness across panel when i look the the corner	0
one about you can only once the person you are calling the phone it	0
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
installed and our kids were devastated the least	0
features are like the radio	1
price	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
have found that very easy to use have a basic knowledge of a computer	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
is a light weight intrusive device which you can anywhere	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
storage supposedly it	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0

canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
both units small speakers	1
the volume is you can blast it if you want	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1

software mediasource can	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
jan has flawlessly for the past	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
having unfilled i d tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
i three batteries going the battery in the g a real powerhouse	1

i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
i nt it displayed way into the screen when	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
it	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1

even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
