devices of nicest is the that electronic one this i ve ever owned	1
great and display sharp my picture just the right size for color desk	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1

slr like latitude to be creative exposure you nt excellent photos its gives yet bother with the settings provide progam and auto if do settings want programming and exposure control to you	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
cheap construction and hard plastic have should the player out the corners they made put some rubber on of	0
then hang have to restart the router the system so would would going i get sometimes again	0

you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
