i find it too bright	0
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
bottom line for the price these things sound great and tons of good	1

for the price it	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1

in addition it seems to work if you about five away although that may have just the batteries with it	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
extremely glad this camera	1
for the price	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1

poor visibility on the keys	0

the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1

the interface	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
no problems dropped signals unlike it lasted months	1
also i can understand why does not ignore the when lists cds	1
all that	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the grain was terrible	0
i not used my new dvd player i am disapointed	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
my first impression was positive	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
apple though products your support is to that	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
works than the linksys	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
nt the clip and the case slip	0
blessing if you a want to transfer your old this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
much better u see in the pictures	1
great product	1
loved the of and polk and klipsich floorstandings	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
you reboot keep your computer even when and force you tell it that is authorized	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
you can do so much more e midi any picture on your computer and you how can make your own apps games	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
slow that it is not useable for of any back ups	0
bright visible screen	1
this extemely lame	0
i as bunch of different formats it would play and	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1

this product	1
more than days it the picture matter what i	0
over this a	0
was very pleasent and helpfull once	1

i and this did solve the problem	1
unlike some who a lemon my dvd came perfect working condition	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
what it was the deal	1
but it seems so well that i do nt with it	1
the second set is	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
life to digital cameras to k	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the d link dir router works as a n wireless	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the woofer is much larger	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
the g for about six weeks and it proven to be it is advertised	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
some good customization options the unit as well	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
is easy makes everythig pretty easy	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0

i was to it even if all other reviews already it was slow	0
i m not willing to accept construction something paid for	0
this player is an ideal purchase	1
a sync issue	0

the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
has to find out more just log to canon is website	0
it to ps asus droid pcs all connect without issue	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
means is good that this not break easily like	1
this phone was the fits pocket without falling out	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i phone there to i	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
this is a little less with long battery life	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
it is running great for all	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
anything this phone does perfectly	1
do nt see having any it the coming year or two do will that with this product be of for free and quick with service reps the service of amazon this item me was faster than i expected is i knew it would be	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
for the buck out there	0
heavy build and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
navigating through super easy especially owned a previous model nokia phone	1
protective case completely useless is it obscures display window	0

the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1

i stunned am and can easily up because i ve never seen anything better its resolution	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
the is not convenient storage device the for your music collection	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
canon is optics are better processing algorithms	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
