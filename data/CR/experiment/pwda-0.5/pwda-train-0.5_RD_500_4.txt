it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
they have a whole bunch devices that	1
chic look and the player a compact form	1

are intuitive for a novice	1
it from to the picture	1
is for you	1
although nokia on the features department it is an outstanding piece for what was to a telephone	1
the nd dvd player a turn on	0
this is phenomenal	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
also it only free shipping and no tax so it is a decent player	1
sounds just as good the zen xtra sounds just as good player	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone is serious digital	1
is great	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
only think of	0
routers years	1
also i can understand why does not ignore the when lists cds	1
this is excellent creative	1
a doubt would say speakers have the same quality as the jbl on stage and are portable can that feature rrb	1
the fm radio is cool	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
the lcd was very large and readable	1
sound is surprising with	1
and layout is a bit funky to standard rectangular layout keypads not weird	0
be for a long wait minutes rrb wait it	0
very compact and portable as great sound quality	1
an excellent phone	1
those to mm cameras find the g and use	0
i it too bright	0
it and does everything	1
battery life is and i have it days or so	0
very compact and portable sound quality	1
the cover that came it did	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
i wished could a little bit louder	0
tried to return it it took get customer	0
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
volume is ok	1
it a usb so you plug in drive	1
without a doubt would say that have the same sound quality as the jbl and are truly portable be played outlet i	1
i called it quits and be this product back	0
the keyboard also very nice and does take some getting used to	1
recommend the superdrive and	1
in words convenient data storage only buy capacity you need for your music collection	0
for what i do use it	1
explorer program down a while i renaming titles but i have reboot the computer or anything open up explorer again	0
did great job the letterbox fill and image still looked normal	1
the second is working just fine	1
the volume range is great so	1
recent price drops have made the in currently available	1
that came did nt	0
look and the player comes with a metal face plate	0
second system and poorly designed	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
that the hard drive just before my class	0
front cover can easily but always so i did nt notice after	0
which be was anything but easy to use	0
firewire	1
this	1
sounds great and apple overpriced ipod	1
the are top notch	1
battery life i use it i have to it days	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
a file just as the zen xtra	0
the other when i was listening to a song it and will not do anything now	0
the rate plans also good at least me	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
is so small but	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
they are very sturdy and trouble balance wise	1
that they make a little bit	1
picture it your and make silent movies that way you wanted to	1
can which is a plus to buy you have an ipod do	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
the phone is sound quality is great do nt have that i miss from my	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
i these to someone of speakers at a reasonable price	1
i am so of netgear is product quality service i recommend to anyone	1
color screen is good	1
i ve already creative tech support and gotten timely responses they for me necessary	1
is easy but has more serious photographers will love so it to grow into	1
after one of disks was recognized but was poor and	0
creative are why	1
price gb of storage	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
superb	1
other is the headphone jack headphones	0
and brag all your friends mountain of dvd player that do half the things this one and of the price	1
i find it too bright	0
is	1
windows explorer windows the jukebox it to drop windows explorer to for the nomad	1
the control seem to get at times and doesnt respond be just operator error	0
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
you to rename a cd title you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the is not convenient storage device the for your music collection	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
the picturers are amazing	1
was as promised newly	1
sound there is no complaints about that	1
the ringtones included are awesome i mention they were polyphonic	1
creating playlists using the included software to was nt as would have liked	0
interface software itself was but easy to use	0
jbl ii as surround is again very nice speaker	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
however it deliver on quality	1
to carry around bother	0
within a year there are	1
i also liked the that you can custom playlist you made not just the computer	1
i this player and would	1
i it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
it	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
what disappointment	0
changing brightness easy with presets and changeable lrb leave	1
software is	1
the price is very good	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
not with my universal remote control	0
great features	1
the no about is for the size the range is you might from this size lrb even expected	0

in the hands who does will good results	1
is a great camera	1
scroll wheel big improvement the ipod touchpad	1
i very intuitive learned through the	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
replaceable	1
with with the us and delivered	1
the and construction are as is the legendary of the nikon optics	1
are amazing	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
the remote but does not work and left there thinking	0
because is	1
i unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price is no better camera out there	1
very simple use	1
be better but there nt really the zen xtra do ve comfortable with it	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
both are economically priced and worth it	1
color screen is good	1
lcd	0
the remote	1
i hooked it only sound a cd fine the audio	0
it is more than and the no matter what i do	1
have the volume level on especially quiet	0
gb	1
is napster now supports their	1
surprisingly quick	1
in it you can t avoid that	1
question the sound range is what from	0
it had heavier and more sturdy	0
lcd screen is great	1
since am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume low a little	0
it very good range than it	1
i hooked everything to going fine	1
the so good my boyfriend wants now	1
i have disappointed to find that is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction which leaves	0
on lrb around pm rrb was at chicago by the time got home from work tuesday	1
know will have problems the future and will be worth it creative only warrant it in is totally ridiculous	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the pictures if your hands even during the entire process of a picture	0
price there is nothing better	1
sound	1
with my sennheiser headphones volume loud enough	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
have to but the e mail is not valid	0
for the price and features it really good	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
fact is could nt be	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
also the player sometimes freezes very problem can be annoying	0
i love this player	1
i wished they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
for this being to use with well laid out controls be learned quickly	1
both the black speakers worth it	1
does not at random times despite displaying player is library	0
ca wrong with these if what looking for is a good sound	1
speakers comes	1
it has failed to deliver on quality	0
which should be user friendly was	0
changing is easy with four presets and i leave minimum brightness for at	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
it very solidly built and a nice dense feel to it	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
in addition	1
m my zx so is a quick review	1
it would either song all or no that was	0
for a think its great	1
the ease of use was very impressive i put by the than what paid for this player	1
the controls very intuitive learned how manuver through the menus quickly	0
that	1
the labeling of firmware a mystery and is just	0
when got it home for via either text or email were nt there	0
scan	1
also can store it is a plus for all you want an ipod say you an do nt much better	1
speakerphone	1
sound wonderful in my opinion i touched equalizers	1
is	1
both black and the white speakers economically priced and worth it	1
my only significant complaint is sound	0
fm recording these have been nice extras	1
mid range is nt the best but is there enough to satisfy not	0
that is a rare and	1
it has x optical zoom for these cameras	0
it in	1
was the wait ag neovo has this more	0
it caused i it stuck with mediasource	0
that limited it a lifetime to	0
i seen usual i	1
have press the buttons hard and frequently i up when meant to scroll	0
other that great	1
transfers through	1
my other incredibly crappy remote is other cheaper apex units	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
this has happened with several different dvd is occasionally if it one time before	0
in all this	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
video stopped	0
yes there is the viewfinder knows this and engineered to parallax is what ot picture	0
gripe is incredibly crappy remote is worse	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
amazon was wonderful picking the next day for	1
great speakers overall	1
these monitors great for the price	1
that is a rare and	1
i was disappointed	0
the freezes and shows no disc	0
door	1
the larger gives better picture in low light the times optical zooms you	0
are amazing	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
loved the slim design	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
a s l o w it with the know but is all because are computer speakers	0
to more times than not so with mediasource	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
the changing colors help tell with	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
also very set up a route to the as netgear	1
i over files in my playlist at and the random a nice job it	1
thought the software was decent it nt complicated to at all	1
is one few dvd players at that can everything at it	1
i could this was cheap set it	0
however for a budget think this camera is	0
had	0
have trouble reading that and	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
is excellent as one suspect from a creative product	1
those will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
price	1
catch with the is to miss precious shots	0
the phone is light and very attractive	1
not wowable good	0
the up and down in magnification which is nice always a display about one quarter down interferes	0
the infrared is blessing if transfer your old phone book me hours entering my numbers	1

i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
progressive player for a relatively low price	1
the other controls are very easy to use	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
does to doesnt respond it may be just	0
features	1
ringtones are awesome were	1
at the i wanted which allows to easily any album my go and combination of price capacity and features easily meets	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
selected it because looked easy to install	1
the player quality is ipod	1
protective case completely useless as since display window	0
think this it is biggest flaw	0
in the hard drive died one morning before	0
flash as all built in flashes cameras with depth being	0
color screen	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the lcd is larger and a more successfully than the nx backlight did	1
if you used a slr mm camera are intuitive	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
light compact	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
finally i was i d leave sprint	0

software is	1
the radio function which	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
to amazement even that process error prone	0
creating was as easy i would have liked	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the setup process for the infuriating the interface sub par	0
prefer besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the scene mode well remainder of	1
but it seems so well that i do nt with it	1

for the price it is a well spent investment	1
enough and there was only one could be inserted	1
the other controls use	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on and seems to	0

all other buttons to touch and work well	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
deficiencies with overcome earphones	0
the picture quality is amazing and can connect to your tv and that way if wanted to	1
speed tests showed that were those my router using home broadband cable	1
the quality is superb	1

replaceable	1
i and i have	1

the mount easy to use it to tie up on the handlebars	1
what junk	0
they are good	1
they great sound a signal	1

the first put it went to bed listen to my music and the handset itself does feel with it	1
i am stunned and can with i never seen anything better within its resolution	0
and this is scrambling to put	0
they sound in my opinion and have touched any equalizers	1
is but if put it too loud depends the might crack	0
if do nt ll into they can be album as	0
thanks amazon is amazing at	1
have found that very easy to use have a basic knowledge of a computer	0
the g a can and fortunately for i the external flashes that money	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
this router is	0
conclusion was ready pay the shipping return the got them	0
the creative	1
superb	1
network it is	1
will and phone is constantly	1
it life excellent downloadable java	1
all all great player blows pod software is simple understand and use a sound	1
the ringtones and did mention	1
i just set manually which	1
like is but	1
to a cd that you have already transferred will become frustrated quite quickly	0
it overall than the ipod but keep mind this not necessarily inferior used in the zx	1
my complaint is sound quality	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
if not picky	0
been at time and while it run while the gaming experience not compromised for me	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
it is carry this around instead of of cd is or tapes	0
this is an excellent value	1
it holds sooooo much files	1
camera has is what is what get	0
as a whole the dvd player a design and	1
great value vs the price	1
and man to on the player the actual the	1
weighty	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
am so tired quality customer i never netgear products	0
very simple to use	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
p s seem to doesnt respond it may just operator error	0
with it anytime made we had to manually the turn on radio button the gui one would nt work	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
like the nomad is but it is	1
i this to two different android	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
it is worth it	1
shareport on this new router worked of	0
would either play at all or skip matter the unit was resting	0
to serve as for is a huge plus	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
because this camera	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
software is great misfortune frequently screwed my music library up work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
light enough to around all without bother	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the unit great is easily worked taking your eyes off the road	1
screen easily scratched if you the warranty you should able to swap it out	0
it	1
than the nx and has backlight which illuminates than is backlight	1
it has nice color	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
got works great i understand that the for iphone and the towers own volume that placed the right measures the better sound so do nt the fact of the remote able to control my iphone highly recommend this	1
it still fits in the palm and it	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
was a little the end	0
the unit works my adapter for my car is also easily worked your off	0
within a year there problems with my menu dial knob	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
however this camera	0
weighty but otherwise fine	0
very simple to	1
t which along several long that route	1
i in lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located the corner of my basement	1
is it more a better player windows which is i have	0
nt say difficult enjoy	0
day when was it will not do anything now	0
usb port so you and network accessible storage	1
it a x optical zoom is	0
nt had really push this player audio aspects on the nomad	0
it would or skip wildly no matter resting	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
overall an excellent phone	1
very bad quality	0
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
i do i hooked xbox little while and was	1
is it could	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
is a display for price	1
have had mine for a month now have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the volume	0
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
that dropped the security settings once and am sure was something that i did or if of the router	0
i have no with	0
thanks to amazon is to return the at on my	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
it can help so so take photos	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
a kbps wma file and sounds	0
it is real of walls but in my house perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
is an excellent value	1
however real intuitive	1
as with all built in flashes in cameras get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
and	1
i positive an and earpiece	1
i thought the software was decent to learn	1
the case is too small me a half hour fit	0
help to tell with a quick glance	1
now that own it i t being it	0
all other buttons are sensitive touch and	1
feel cheap the plastic is like it and it	0

finally when i sprint	1
the usually but has occasional such not a a particular point in movie every time we played it being to access special features dvd	0
i tried support number for a day always busy	0
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
connection constantly dropped	0
fact could be easier to use	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
with their tech support you connected right away and have to wait rrb and got imac and macbook back	1
not inclined to product again	0

it the case pretty useless re for travel or if load all your songs	0
