you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
to easy very set up	1
the zoom goes down in magnification which is nice at most settings there the zoom size always that display of is about one quarter of with interferes from the top of the screen the way up and down a viewing but	1

you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1

upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
the loved slim design	1
because are limitations to with of can do what frequency adjustments there you speaker built crossovers the in	0

the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
i audio aspects have had to to really push this satisfactory labs creative limit but nt on from are player as should be expected the nomad the time	0

an immense amount in love fell with this camera options and power combines ease of use with i of it	1
in other capacity the zen is device the convenient data not words only buy a storage you need for your music collection	0
to can move the focus range a scene to an the push manual and helpful shooting with on screen of a button focus mode that almost anywhere in the scene be really that if has you it is tough would automatically focus	1

this device now that is plus napster other supports one via their software	0
other from operating system result tagging the nomad is problems	0
however i budget a for think this camera is an excellent choice	1

the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
drastic and see a this dell can i monitor between difference ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	0
this router have the best is i used to date	1

i find it too bright	0
than without it the environmental audio has sound completely useless and is made most of my songs almost worse however	0
you different type of display make your profile change can manage the contrast of backlight either list or tabbed	1
i a nokia recommend highly	1
first of all the is player sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
the player hangs on a file transfer reset in up while prompting a every once	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
went out second lasted before weeks about two the video the	0
to is to will love an easy use but has features that more serious photographers for so it excellent beginners is camera it grow into	1
lots are there of interesting features such included as eax customization and	1
the fact mpeg files this model would play jpeg slideshows was discovered big by accident for me a a visual artist and i data disk that that will play without on it regular cd r a plus as vcd formatting	1
there was picture neither nor sound	0
small is it	1
different formats tried as bunch i of to see if it would play and it did	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
speakerphone loud and clear some currency converter nice features extra like has and a stopwatch	0
creative mediasource software starting from scratch ok rip to catalog my cds burn if you are is but before used what to rip music i i bought musicmatch and guess the zen	0
to like programming and exposure control gives bother slr do if creative be with the settings progam and to exposure settings auto excellent photos yet you provide nt want latitude you its	0
could be better designed interface used the	0
no con i can think only is of camera	0
main dial backlit not is	0
this fragile is too use for normal product	0
even over with better you music listen to can the optional headset the integrated radio	1
in fact each of my creative mp players in the first place software problem had	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
with t can way go wrong either this price	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
of the body construction in general has quite a bit stainless steel a disappointment after of plastic the heft the s and	0
this player ideal an is purchase	1
just ago this camera two days already and love received the features it has	1
i and got this thing for christmas i been happy very have with it ever since	1
xtra purchased jukebox nomad the is fantastic i gb and it zen	1
weak since normally am in an office i them at however at a pretty low volume and i low volumes they sound a little keep	0
sound is a fun little gadget do expect nt high definition it	0
the sound quality really good is	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
it has good color and price was great	1
selected it because to looked easy install it	1
this got is a its little its great features nice really a beatiful screen and ergonomics great phone tiny	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
painless counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty not	1
it still it in the palm is not heavy your hand and of fits	1
i ordered it in chicago a lrb by was rrb pm and with no extra shipping costs the monitor monday afternoon at my door on home the time i got around from work tuesday	1
the setup process for the nomad and with the player the is interface infuriating is sub par	0
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
the screen complaint one is too easily scratched	0
mp x optical zoom comes stamp of approval photos with detail and challenges far a lot of features received easy to understand takes use the above mp cameras and add on options and with last all great software but by that not least of my fiance is absolutely beautiful	1
it would spin there spin and more some then show no that read was disc on the display	0
simply the firmware the os and or quite that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
the bass is is and sound deep very crystal clear as well	1
also the carrying mine that have with side covers the the display controls even though it case so are reachable i the see open came up to to up display	0
another nice thing is that was unit scanned outputs both optical and coax audio digital i the latter mentioned not the in the has though d literature before buying	1
this will model apex not with my universal remote control work	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
as well in program tag d i point is a strong editing the	1
my dwl work does not is as there repeater no di s and firmware ap for this update to support a product	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
was neither picture nor sound there	0
beats battery life hours excellent ipod is	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
more definitely capable of i the speakers with sound than any ve owned computer room filling other	1
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
most life the drawback to cameras digital k reeves to quote battery	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
easy understand all in all this blows away the i pod with a great player to use and that features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
play nt wo a lot of discs	0
it failed completely from to the at which time picture worked	0
it will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent the backlight in for warranty repair	0
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
even such bass rather small pretty impressive from is the drivers	1
the dvd player is fine	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
its is system focusing also very flexible	1
recommend highly this to hard monitor beat at this price point	1
of cost the for this product i could not ask for more	1
the screen is are unlimited ring and tones bright	1
i am disapointed even used dvd new my player not already i have and	0
is nice x zoom	1
i loved it until it broke but less than for of time is work an acceptible period month not something to a	0
fact it is could nt be easier to use	1
am i phone my enjoying a lot	0
one beef well it the scroll does nt work like d as i is as	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
some movies played it yesterday it wo nt play today	0
alot better battery the is than most of the there out phones	0
will the main reason i am not with this product satisfied is the fact that it however lock up at odd times	0
i more buy i with these happy ll probably very m for the front channels	1
would play tried as it to see if bunch of different formats i it and did	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
apex think i player the best dvd get for the price you can is	0
allow zen launched nor but does not its a folder allow does programs it the documents to be opened or data files to be stores from structure disk	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
the problem with this box more frequently that it reboots several times an hour if not is	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
my even more is wife pleased due to its widescreen	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
up was easy to monitor promised as works and set with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	0
well within days the video output quit working	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
the sound quality use been it since day one the base constantly calls we and now there has the base be some sort of short circuit in to poor can seems no longer the ac adapter drops or with the base turns off completely	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
but my portable speakers is very well good works and on the sound	1
it is a fun little gadget expect high definition sound nt do	0
from the g delivers what must current quality be best image color response of digicams detail tonal balance megapixel any overall a the and considered point of view	1
looks fantastic iphone w esp docked	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
i never all the whistles and bells use will this machine is capable of	1
bright and is clear picture the sharp and the sound is good	1
great monitors are these for the price	1
in any case ability by however album is navigation artist i ok an miss to navigate by folders	0
portability is expensive plans horrible and customer service after years with that carrier seemed heaven sent	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
i do but know software the people are saying nt other what is awesome	1
awkward to use remote is feeling flimsy and the	0
as a portable it player feel should a bit more durable	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
wonderful is for to have this your first dvd player	1
nomad main the with problem zen jukebox the xtra gb is the software	0
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
the razor are pictures sharp even in macro	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
this is a great camera for you	1
the storage is great capacity	1
very shortly after getting them died	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
is on the cheap side material	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
fast usb makes transfers very having for	1
is to everything this in else category this compared for the best most definately bang the buck	0
feedback using jack construction quality poor product support difficulty of suffers the scroll wheel with and creative zen feedback about problems the reasonably consistent headphone from	0
have the and player since xmass had love it	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
most is the battery better than alot of the phones out there	1
just right looked the price performance	1
xtra tracks in order of album shuffle etc noting standard on all jukebox players but worth is in multiple play modes is that zen not deficient the this matter	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
difficult navigation do wo nt necessarily say i but enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate difficult nt i	0
preform tried these speakers and i them to well found below expectations for this price	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking whole the up screen and have to memorized scroll down the by one or one the menu where they are by one order has select them to using in number keypad	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it zoom and review pictures used it can also be the shutter to trigger	1
it nice and small and excellent when comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
or are very sturdy and have no balance wise trouble they handling oddly shaped speakers	0
for me its perfect and games and word docs the quality for is more than acceptable	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
similarly small speakers are small with both units	1
the phone very small light and is attractive	1
it is for buck the the most bang out there	1
having would nt mind does an external adjustable antenna but it i fine on is and as the speed the bottom floor of the house much is improved	1
are amazing the picturers	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
i find of on this phone entertaining games the lack quite disturbing	0
better works than the speakerphone any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
and nice compact	1
but the of for looking player my opinion you if apex dvd re i love it	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
is trash thing this	0
this phone otherwise highly recommended is	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
now that i own it t however can being imagine i without it	0
about should ve i all the online comments trusted the terrible repair team of acer	0
i ve well this thing for a had is all screwed up month treated never quite the headphone jack it dropped it and than less	0
item shipped out quickly good in business condition came no easy to had added up disk we have nt to use re set so at all so far since is it delivery with my wife is no giving about me the was longer neighbors her wireless internet connection the router on set security benefits losing her laptop longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1

this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
again should were and spot on projected the tv where they from the front of the sounds	1
apparently t mobile can heavily back logged with is t keep demands and up	0
this evolve always that you ll so many capabilities have room for new technologies as has they	0
convenience because it through the usb port works	1

i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1

i more dissapointed that acer was nt was helpful	0
disney have ad my sent back to apex nt because wo it play certain i and other dvd movies	0
there a year within are with my menu dial knob problems	0
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
giving this player cautious recommendation m i	0
on is material the cheap side	0
i apex hate but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
sound is my only significant complaint quality	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
the are is mechanics player also flawed	0
i called the tech support and they helped me install new this but firmware did not solve the problem	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1

creative i software is and to bought catalog burn music if you my cds but to used musicmatch i rip are starting from scratch before mediasource ok the zen rip guess what	0
i do nt easy editing of id tags care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows always	1
the router d tell you myself my experiences go back to the store i waiting got to so i never but far enough to try this	1
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
to controls the simple ipod ones much inferior the are	0
the the router negotiated the speed just fine with presented and switch a gige link	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
as it stands now the case re pretty useless player if up up the unless is for travel or you you load all your songs packing beforehand	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
it works of cx during installation flawlessly	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
bottom line well made camera and to use to features include to the lense external flash use very flexible and powerful easy ability filters choices	1
problem network d link support failed and my actual to the optical this which was guided the router was more helpful to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from that fios time me block	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
i it find too bright	0
songs using albums problem i musicmatch software already on my computer to load onto and no had this unit	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
i tell apex but love amazon and i everyone hate	0
the capacity storage is great	1
of use the ease while very impressive the i was i for by price was about more than what put paid amazon off this player	1
possibly the biggest advantage herself and is him by that the user opening replace the battery fact this player the can the lid has popping in the new battery	1
the main problems for me the control station that is dsub the from cord to the sub is too short	0
the auto focus performs actually but i well having the optional scene modes and are dummy proof they correspond to many i would situations love in which seek to use the camera	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
it spending nt want pretty does this kind course you look asthetics something has the that bit down of of cash	0
great features	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1

for the money apex machines have good features	1
overall an excellent phone	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
small size	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
of ve tried playing all i these they and play all discs great	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
this product is good to enough integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
this phone size and won me over was a big seller the it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
the sound quality is over easy to read looks cool screen means bright the ipod the unit and the replaceable battery and a major advantage excellent is	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
the drawback most to battery life digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
to i using mediasource found load songs your to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
set with wpa up no problems	1
for my application software setup i found the setup software cd the to be useless on enclosed	0
is it easy	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
this is of one the nicest electronic devices i that ve ever owned	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the the from service supplier was exceptional	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
this system is very powerful	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
easy is it	1
the is a very durable compact brand a package find i to trust and nikon that i can be	1
so for a little fiddling game re you if be may you very pleased with this day forecaster	1
i found these speakers and tried them well expectations to below this price for preform	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
granted i but problems used me that setting it up enough was christmas have for about hours for long for my mom for this dvd player to only find with this dvd player	0
devices for songs less than good achievement on other minimal pause that between a hard drive based player	0
and brightness is easy changing four presets i one user changeable lrb at leave that brightness minimum with for at night rrb	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the dedicated flashes does sync at of a second the g just does it as with third party flashes with from canon	1
an at a great system incredible price	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
recharge stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours the battery to fully the included ac adapter via at most	1
nt first night went got this phone i i it next to me and i put when just to listen weight and the its too light handset itself the to my favorite music station anything does to bed feel so comfy with it	0
if delivered you a quality product want on time buy one this	1
i horns avoid usually do i but nt hear anything overly extreme	0
i did the because research and settled on and of to a ton speakerphone size small option great priced calling plan this phone access of corporate my email	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
key instead	0
the s pii fanatics look at bass	1
well within days the video output working quit	0
was the lcd screen very large and readable	1
this was an awesome player before video the output no longer worked	0

my this speaker does the same wonders for well low end ht setup	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
it is feature easy use and yet to very rich	1
just actually it find started the player but then i i checking ruining my media was to that the apex is thought the discs	0
look they fantastic	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
read screen the large and easily is	1
transfering is makes everythig pretty easy the software easy	1
the the terrific sound are easy to remove battery and plusses produced by the nomad	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
phone great	1
there is much a great phone mine has been without any problems in other reviews about the features it this phone is worked which of said right out of the box	1
even music to the optional headset you can listen with better over integrated the radio	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
integrated is very well the mms technology which phone this with you will enjoy	1
the the design and is sleek color screen has good resolution	1
no lrb sized a mm x mm sells rrb power adapter or what ever stupid size is it one	0

sub woofer is large	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
even the bass is rather small from such drivers pretty impressive	1
quite disturbing the lack of entertaining games on this phone i find	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
you with mp player much less get much more memory for this than an ipod	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1

range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
good speaker producing want the thump that this capable for of rrb lrb very for is who computer those a this is probably necessary	1

technical support rude and unhelpful	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
for is and this music a good deal data storage	1
all in all like bad customer service device run bad hell from this product	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
tech support you actually once was very pleasent and helpfull got someone	1
the shine bright screen makes rebates free after commands phone color and this are very responsive	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1

speed wireless showed tests speeds that to were comparable the those of my home broadband cable modem home wireless as when using my router input	1
very was fast and they shipping set easy to are up	1
i extremely pleased with this router remain	1
to have say a month now for mine and have i had i have enjoyed it	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
the nd dvd player which a not power supply had caused occasionally to faulty turn on	0
at allows end of the day i a wanted those what to player is and me large capacity easily was any album from go the i my collection wherever the zen xtra which combination of price capacity and features easily meets play criteria	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
i as pointed out it to the bad again other reviewers the months or some other way in go have same because fully in next the construction expect is pretty flimsy	0
scroll the bar is a travesty enough said	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
capacity storage	1
plus i the speaker technology wise think this is awesome makes it even great i love this phone	1
set wpa up with no problems	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
so the system would hang i sometimes going have to restart the router then get would again	0
i sent my repairs small but very problematic for acer in monitor for such a problem to of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
my dad also and has an apex tv it value another great was for the money	1
so this one off i went to did and a faster router pros get the job i bought it for admirably	1
it also a lot the ipod less than costs	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
easy to use the mount is it is to velcro straps just tie up on the handlebars	1
d buy another i great phone	1
the phone book is friendly user is excellent and the speakerphone very	1

it little a through so many levels to to scroll want to get cumbersome the selection you is	0
takes excellent photos	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
speaker seeing and the sound hearing of the i tour pop after i was sold	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
well was nice while it lasted it	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
is large sub woofer	1

i also made that fact not just the computer you can save custom playlist you liked on the player the	1
am do like this phone overall but unforutnately returning it i i	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
very the happy the monitor and with price	1
the only minor nits i have with is camera a bit slow it instead of it needs a wrist strap is fairly boxy looking a neck strap and it the are between shots	0
i guess it limited lifetime that means lifetime may a take warranty to collect on the warranty	0
i overall like the unit	1
are surprisingly quick through usb transfers	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
this with long battery life than a little less a very light phone oz is	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
after on it stoppped scenes higher number playing months dvds	0
would i strongly recommend this product	1
is much larger the woofer	1
in the morning is this rather a nice feature it is early e and i easy listen to rather listening you than heavy metal no problem	1
