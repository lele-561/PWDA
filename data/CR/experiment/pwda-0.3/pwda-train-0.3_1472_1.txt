no matter the format	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
the screen is blurry but if you click you should be able to make it out	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
the color is red and is so attractive	1
so much as with creative products it was useless and ugly so much aswith creative products	0
i tried it and it did not work as advertised i called support	0
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
a bright vivid and clear image with clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great viewing angles at a price	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
great great investment	1
the speakers are no good but the sound is good for the size and is what you might expect from speakers this size and perhaps even better than that	1
of a guitar the sound this slim design puts guitar player out	1
excellent sound i found the best way to listen through the jukebox	1
fragile	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
of the unit for the price good it is a very nice dvd player player	1
the technical support phone line giving my for responsible was technical support stars	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading www crazycellphone com	1
are beautiful prints the	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
image	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker the amount i paid	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
this is a great book to have for your first birthday	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
you can graphics assign when rings also and to special people special they call	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and very good provided is more than about feet away	1
software is another great misfortune frequently crashes up screwed work with mp s nt does my music library hard to operate the list goes on and on	0
not as sleek looking although a as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked good creative mediasource to cddb service	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
i bought this router and expected to get a good deal but these random disconnects kills it for me https www amazon com gp product b a c f ref sr	0
it is just a nice intrusive device can anywhere	1
a ton of stuff in huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs and on this thing	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
great value for money and for the price you can t beat it	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
the battery stays charged for a long it the battery time and takes no more can be than or hours at most to less than a day can be fully recharge can be via the included ac adapter	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
that all i can say is this is an excellent devise	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
great quality picture and features	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
in fact each of files my creative mp  players had software problem in is in the same the first place	0
fm receiver it has been renamed	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
did not come in a box like some people who came their dvd machine came in perfect working conditioin perfect working conditio unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition unlike some people who got their dvd machine in a boxmy dvd machine came in perfect working conditio in perfect functioning conditio came their dvd player in a box my dvd machine came in perfect working conditio in perfect working condition	0
second the payment system and the system are poorly designed	0
the resolution good is very good and the colors are bright and of the screen the colors even changeable	1
overall i like the game	1
the in a i d tag editing is not as easy	0
what the hell is wrong with the hell this thing	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
however it only seems to work if you remove the battery pack from the case although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the setup process and the for the nomad infuriating the interface with is player is sub par	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
someone who does nt it will yield good results idiot program auto mode	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
your health is fine	1
you of course have some good with the unit as well	1
this that you ll always for new technologies as they evolve	1
screen was good easy to read	1
the quality mp is about the price right for the target market of this camera	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
i have nt had time to should push really to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory this player be from as expected creative labs	1
the player player dvd player does not work properly	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the included are awesome and i mention they	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd it to do what it is to it will be figure out what play	1
this is a great camera for you	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i as this apex dvd player for myself good of got it because good reviews for on at value bought the money a a variety christmas different sites	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
it does not have an auto parking assist light which is nice for those who live in a light city as it allows the driver to see in the light	0
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
folders be created for the audio files	0
to is nt the best certainly it but mid range there and enough to satisfy anyone is looking not spend on computer speakers	0
finally i reiterate t mobile my thumbs down rating for as a carrier	0
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
they are simple and perfect to be used in conjunction with others	1
unfortunately it turns to out be the disposable type	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not break mechanically otherwise you will not be able to zoom	0
the it day when i other listening to a song do anything now locked up and was not will	0
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
however if you want to build a house across the street and these are your requirements then this company will do the job	1
the is easy use high quality in size	1
i it think apex is same the best dvd player you can get for the get price	1
i am a lawyer apex cust service no help	0
has battery radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and	1
this its got features a beatiful and its tiny	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
i it have used this monitor for a few months and been using it works great and i have had no problems	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
software is easy to use	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
having unfilled id tags will cause to potentially in	0
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
came well packaged	1
focusing on a display rack in a brightly lit during day time pictures in a shade of orange	1
nt of our disney movies many do play on this dvd player	1
one downside though is that the only downside autofocus the battery does not work well it is not waterproof and when battery is low	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
trumps instincts are razor sharp even in	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
season great speakers overall	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
you re to hear going to need some new to buy new headphones the stock ones to be able suck	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
it user interface on the router to be used either for as a file server or as a web server or print serve ws the usb port to be connected to the router it allows the usb port on the routers to b allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for as a file server nas or print server	1

good range speed	1
there was picture neither nor sound	0
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most viewing angles be beat	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
with the increased memory option was flawless the windows home professional instaled otherwise netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow	0
the price is very good	1
of am can and looking elsewhere for something that business withstand the rigor a i disappointed traveler	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
my only significant complaint is	0

online go to easy oops and adjust it there	1
the door would not close	0

this is camera closest than to perfect other any digicam that is megapixel	1
there are so many functions in this device little is known about the yet powerful camera it is a camera	1
easy to use the mount is it is to velcro straps just tie up on the handlebars	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
this is a very good monitor for its price	1
mediasource did not respond	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the good news bottom line speakers sound great and a lot of people will love them they have tons of good bas is for the price these things sound great and a lot of potential have tons of good bass	1

the on the other end the can hear you perfectly	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1

the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0

the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
the camera great camera it is very easy it also is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous camera flexibility camera in aperture priority shutter priority and both auto manual modes	1
sometimes it working the system whole time and sometimes it would hang so i would have to try to get it restart the router then would get going again	0

they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
my biggest problem with this speaker this ipod is the incompatibility ipod with my my nd generation ipod nano	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
at the very a sturdier more protective carrying would be nice	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0

progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
i chose this one because from brand over the others what i read it was the really liked this one because from what i read it was the what i saw and best deal for the mone what i saw and best what i read it was the what i saw and best deal for the mone i really liked this onebecause from what you read i like this onebecause from what i read it the what you saw an deal for the money	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
it is easy and fun for kids to use	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
main dial is not backlit	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
owned i have this camera for a short time give it up for anything would nt and	1
yes the picture quality the features any other camera and features which are quality is excellent but too the features a camera numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is the problem very thin	0
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
the unit works great with any camera for photography and is also easily worked without taking your eyes off it	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
fm just re taking having lunch at the park waiting for a bus ll you or you a brisk jog whether glad you had the be radio	0

price gb storage of	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction system	0
the game was not finished and the game was in alpha stage at best	1
the possibilities with auto manual and very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc	1
i really have no complaints over no control the quality of this unit	0
the ability to search for music contained in a folder is disabled this means that even though the music is sorted via folders on the player the music remains unsearchable	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
the changing colors are easy to tell with a quick glance	1
this is an excellent value	1
full spectrum sound full from to base great highs	1
and so far have not had any problems with them not being able to work	1
device now that napster is supports this one other plus via their software	0
the benefits of the slim design	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
problem is the fastest speed anything has to it been mb s even in same room	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
spin and then it would spin read spin some more and then show on the would stop and read read read spin some more and then show on the display that there stop and the disc was no dis display that there stop and the disc was no disc	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
to the first few weeks it player was everything i expected this for be an affordable multi format player dvd with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
had more sturdy casing	0
the when at the same level eax keeps the volume in handy for any song will come that mode i take my holiday plane rides	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
a week out of the hospital and i began to see the bruises from the surgery more frequent each day	0
well within days the video output was working	1
but anyway i think i think the only thing you should really look at here is be looking the i think that fact that it is a phone and that it the phone does have voice dialing	1
the color is red is and so attractive	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
i anytime recommend this phone to anyone can	1
to think creative like for tinker i those of us that offers some advantages	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
again nt buy would because of the customer service	0
have in my playlist moment and the random does a mixing	0
my only gripe is about the hardware the buttons	0
cons i think great the satellites great look ugly	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
while the majority of it was good i was turned off by the part about more than what i expected	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
not the song at all or skip no that the unit resting	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
it gives great performance and the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge and it is easy to charge in it as well	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
now there is one more complaint i and was raw images that thing the software that comes with it for to raw images a only shoot the and did replace with i in raw image mode about the g first is me i mbyte cf which gives the mbyte cf have as opposed processing	0
in however case miss by artist album is i any an navigation ok ability to navigate by folders	0
it has lighter to carry around enough functionality to use it is and	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
access the only problem i have found with the internet service is that it mls not well does very that at all	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
with eax on you can control your sound quality which is why you can get different variations of sound	1
i got this for christmas and it love it is a great gift	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
for the cost of this product i not could more for ask	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
by phone	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1

the battery amazing	1
for those who dont know the fact that this is capable of doing something very good for a small amount of rrb this is probably necessary	1
there is no need to offer any information to the public	1

be done right and forget about the sleek looks if it can t play it s not all some of your real dvds	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1

for first routers years good the worked	1
y camera nikon after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
the noise cancelling included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
ve tried playing and they all play great	1
i started accessing and find the experience of transfering files to be the same find to expect downloading it to be extremely slow	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
it let have a lense cap but it wo does which you real good pics with it take nt is on	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately am returning it i	1
i also liked as well the fact that want to listen to you can save custom playlist like the fact that you can create your own playlists as well the feature that want to listen to you can save custom playlist you made on the player phone and play it on any device not just the compute you made on the player phone and play it on any device not just the computer	1
but lower quality a low comes price with	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the features are really cool like the radio	1
there some limitations are with it limitations to what you can do limitations of the with frequency adjustments when it comes because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
wo play a lot discs	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
even works better on g band if its than the linksys	1
when i was in an outdoor area with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving at all	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
this player seems to be work fine with everything else	1
when quality the screen was nt contracting or glitching the was good but overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
is decent as well is small looking and nice the display and light it	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone ve ever had	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
the canon software the raw image does the camera present a raw image with been at all but by after it has not processed for raw images all the image affecting settings in you	0
this phone is a winner	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
i ve this thing month and the headphone jack	0
door	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
light it is when thing easy to use it is dont even know you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it you hold it in your hand it is so is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
kind i bulky and the wheel is awkward but can deal with that of	0
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
acer has been awful to deal with they have a terrible customer service and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
on my main computer did not work right the software	0
this led monitor  is fantastic	1
all your ipod data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have a great way to store your ipods data and have an ipid do also you can  store data on it which is a  you plus for   all you people  who  want to buy an ipod just to say you a great way to store your ipod data and have  an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
while in the memory the keyboard connector is connected	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed s video with lots	0
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
i love this monitor	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the g a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs be charged but the also enables you to use the camera in without running down the battery	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
the food is very good	1
very life lasting battery long	0
it however has failed to deliver on quality	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it great feels great looks great and is loaded with features	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the buttons and the pim and the buttons	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
really easy set up out of the box and got my wireless lrb laptops desktop and smartphones connected the internet in minutes	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
i would not recommend this product to anyone	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
everything fine with was great it until it started for me dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1

i love my new nomad its great	1
solid resistant to scratches and dents	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
the movie clips taken if you have free will in them and always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
my tests showed that the results were similar to those of my tests when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the controls on the side of which i like because my thumb when i hold the thing	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
overall	1
from in to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was minutes	1
i and nt wo times their on line support site contact apex digital through to have their telephone line and they is tried answer my emails but several their telephone line always busy	0

it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
color screen is good	1

when did not exist the options for email i got it home i discovered that the menu  options for option for sending messages via text or email simply didnt exist i got home and noticed were nt ther sending messages via either text or email simply noticed were nt there	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
movie were as the intended directors the sounds	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1

otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
the pc side software can be confusing and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some of the others	0
having access ever you go	1
best in class performance	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
these would have nice extras	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
both are very easy to learn use beginners and intuitive enough for advanced levels are easy even a novice	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
bottom line line to have a wide range of well made camera easy the to use line very flexible and powerful features line to include the ability to use  external flash and lense flash filters choices	1

the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
but great for what i do use it is perfect	1

first the is very good a bit of sound quality is okay but the eax can cause sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutesafter a bit of soun audio interference  after about minutes	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
you can manage the brightness and change the type of backlight or different type of display either list or tabbed	1
one at minimum brightness changing easy user four presets and with is changeable lrb i leave that brightness for at night rrb	1

the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
do nt buy this player	0
you have press the buttons hard to and scroll i end up frequently enter when i pressing to meant	0

the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
it has a nice color screen	1
this product is too fragile for me	0

i liked the cds but i wish it would have been with the album as well i	0
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
what i do at lower volume like is that are poor nt very music listening tonal qualities	0
i gave fact it i think it was due only was a bit of a mess i took it out of the box due stars but i gave it due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1

all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe times a tad little too loud at times too quiet at times on the phone but when there are loud for my taste quieter talkers on the other end at of the line	1
when talking not is the voice very clear	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0

of nt insert in the ear cavity the best the small headphones you can really expect much out the headphones but you are	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased with it in that it will work but that is just for current state of things	1
most products they are better will last if taken care i have no idea how sturdy they are i do have to say that somewhat in fact of and the truth logitech is products are no exception to this rule it is better however since are made to last and will last if taken care of and the truth logitech is products are no exception to this rule it is better however since they are i do have to say that somewhat in fact a great deal more sturd they are i do have to say that somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	0
and seems feature complete	1

easy to use with clear instructions in the install drive contained	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the car will be running for the cost of a replacement battery just like before	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1

my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
the main reasons the main reasons price along with the replaceable battery i picked the nomadthe price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked noma were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
capacity storage the is great	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout getting complete remote control are only so so it cycle nt back the must filenames through with really long names you to normal size of of mp s the before does show every zoom setting	0
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the color screen makes this even after rebates phone shine bright and the speakers are very good	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
was looking forward it even all the other reviews already said it was	0
only thing that keeps me from creative is a cd burner	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
my dad also has a business and it was not for the money	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
despite most reviewers and sound quality giving kudos would not recommend it to the zen for music rated out of by quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
there was occasionally a lip sync battle	0
bottom line it it did work the way supposed to router was so we re returning it we bought this nt for our two computers	0
i hate but apex everyone and i tell love amazon	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
after we discovered the problems  we tried to contact apex could not get any help from them when we  but we never elephone number is always busy and support line they do not answer their web custome got in touch with them the customer support telephone custome we have tried to ge number is always busy and support line they do not answer their web customer support	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
it is small overall bigger than  the ipod ipod but keep in mind in mind that ipod is a this is because in mind different less expensive but as good as ipod and not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is than other cheaper apex units	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
very long lasting battery life	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer never products service would i recommend anyone i know that to netgear	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
i like the idea but it is not perfect	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
you at best ll  be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by very limited the at best software is mediocre at best	0
the explorer program did shut not down a explorer a couple couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres the game but i did nt have to reboot not the computer of times even a couple or of times while i was renaming titles and changing genres the game but i did nt have to reboot not the computer of times even a couple or anything just open up explore anything just open up explorer again	0
navigation really set it up could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you much that for me ve gotten comfortable with it	0
i am awe in into of enormous put this camera canon quality absolutely the g	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
works great	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
larger than the nx and has a backlight which illuminates the nx is green	1
overall the g delivers must be considered the best image quality of current megapixel from a tonal balance color response point of view	1
silverish color really adds a nice touch	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
the are reading read dim screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright not bright enough to read be seen at night but dim enough not too bright to read the screen is not bright enough to read be seen at night but dim enough so it does light on the screen nt blind yo so it does light on the screen nt night but dim enough not too bright to read the screen is not full of blue light not full with blue ligh blind you when you blue light is bright not bright enough to read dim screen is very easy to read and the blue light be seen at night but dim enough not too bright to read the screen is not full of blue light not full with blue lig stare too long	1

it may works great	1
great product works i think this perfectly for my office	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
battery life is very good have i it and day use every i to charge it every days or or so	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
i have not had yet the pictures i have had seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures any problems with so i am very pictures but i have always had pleased	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1

the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
i think i like it	1
simply the firmware the os and or quite that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0

its not a very big deal but can also be dangerous if the player sometimes freezes	0
did a ton of because of the small size speakerphone option priced calling and access to my corporate email	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it easy to use is and yet rich feature very	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0

here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i was dissapointed a bit surprised that acer was nt on the list more helpful	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0

the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to about and out of the cage and then i get this monstrosity cage to fit time in box took its cage	0
full size	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
i have had this player and been able to is after the frustration and aggrivation getting the player to do it job	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
also very light and fluffy	1
no matter the format	1
which was answered by very helpful competent	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
i found this to be a great idea	1
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
it seems to me that the case is sturdy and durable some people have complained about the case not being waterproof but that is not really true	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
the device is pretty solid itself	1
this dvd is good but is basicly junk	0

not counting the time i spent watching the songs on youtube	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
overall a good product for the price	1
you can turn up the volume to be heard for a minute or so that it does not cause that big of a disturbance	1
i did and i m happy to say mine worked works fine out of the box	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
c i do i do love audio but sync not use the which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music is is a great way to keep your music i really like the music player collection on the computer	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
all and all i am very happy with this camera	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay this great player	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
i thought i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only had a couple of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for the first time i followed the instructions for the second time	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
plays now it still so it just you can t see everything	0
the music did not play from the start and the ad played for about a minute and a half before it started to play	0
had a jvc system sound that better was think it was good but the onkyo sound is amazin it was a few years ago and i thought it was very good and it was years ag years old was pretty good and i thought ago and i thought it was pretty good and i think it was good but the onkyo sound is amazin it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1

this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
fragile fragile	0

acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
more way less expensive than the ipod	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
the world	0
they and i have even any	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
other than that this thing	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
its focusing system is also the system very flexible	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
please this much superior piece of equipment before plopping half grand ipod	1
also the design of the design is flawed	0
apex is the best dvd rental brand for dvd players	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
the device is small and well designed would like to i would recomment it highly	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
the most setting does a great job but of the time auto are there manual settings for those who want them	1
i see a between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of	0
it smell like burning plastic when open drive	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0

thuumbs to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
is	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
some features in the user interface	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
unfortunately i bought a player the ps could nt play all dvds and now can t	0
neither message was answered	0
because other players that complain about this player are saying that this player is not broken it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
i m panel with much very saved up the properties but open that to have some equalizer or switch know music have now i of my sound card is and still every time i control between i and videos settings games the sound is frustrated more acceptable	0

the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
is rather slow i only use so it nt bother me too much	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
buy the device only buy the data you need for the device if the device is not a convenient data center	0
good battery life	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are very good very good are not quite as good as mm	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
i am using as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that may arise	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output stopped	0

reboot the installation software had several times i and to my unfortunately crashed vista pc at least twice not fun	0
the is a great package and i found nikon to be the best that i can find	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
music as a portable battery pack player it should feel a bit more durable	0
get it it is not every day	1
is i have clicker the is on the mouse pad the only problem stiff	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
the problems came from my video card	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
portable portable	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
as though mentioned may still work better the creative is software notmad actually really robust despite what others have said i mediasource before	0
size bigger than the ipod	0
is phenomenal this router	1
the world is small	1
works super well easy	1
i try navigating the player is built in menu and still would nt work	0
i did nt think i would would be happy to say that find this quality and ease of use to be a good deal but i am for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
it really that even after it really that reading some of the instructions it a bit hard is still hard to figure out	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
very good range and there seems to be no problem in the horizontal position	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
its dead and it no longer recognizes anything	0
p s i the remote control seem to work properly i does seem to get confused at times i and does nt respond but it when i try to use the p s may be just operator error	0
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
is mediasource an application serious with user interface flaws	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
going to the movies is so easy	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
from ability to feature a up router drive the the hard is an nice connect when backing external to my various computers	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
some people you use the case as has the player cover has the case cover as long as the case covers dont have the the cas sue for me and i not bee have problems with the flip switch on the bottom a case cover that releases the player cover  has the case cover as long as the case covers dont have the the cas sue for me and i not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as has the player cover has the case cover as long as the case covers dont have the the cas sue sue for me and i not been an issue for m the case covers dont have the the case cover switch	1

the price performance looked just right	1
awesome system	1
overall i like it	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
this can think of is probably one of the few dvd players at that can on the market that play almost everything almost you throw at it	1
ways by this far the nicest one in so many is	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
the instructions that come with it to things simple	1
good windows premium is the and friendly nt recommend starter rrb lrb user do	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht and i love my i hope this setup	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the problems came from my video with the video card	0
sharp image	1
this phone has so many other features ir just to name a few the features above i list as the most important	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
user replaceable battery	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like back and forth and the dvd is to go are dirty	0
i highly recommend it	1
pictures are very clear and you take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
the best fm radio is cool	1
they are not wowable good	0
range was comparable to possibly slightly worse the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
traveling it a great phone if you are over the world is all packed with wonderful features	1
is okayed the appearance	1
i using it ve be g for about it weeks proven been has advertised itself to the all that six is and	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
the memory is gone	0
due to lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork just the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the store to worry even better you do nt have being on the phone to  worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
great camera great investment	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
i m delighted with this product	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
m very happy far at no problems had all so ve and i i	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
these monitors are great for	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
this product is amazing	1
the sound quality is fantastic it is to this stacks of cd is or tapes	1
i the software was decent was nt to learn at all	1
very and precise speaker hook ups	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
feedback product support is universally poor is not limited it to company is	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
incredible is nt to want be a sensationalist but this computer do i	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable as well	1
the auto focus performs well but i the optional scene modes they are dummy proof in which i seek use the camera	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures and does nt have to be expensive	1
it is not possible for me to upload files and mediasource to it and i had to be creative as i was used to winxp the player and upload and download the files into it	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
this player is not any price recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
this product is definitely definitely worth the purchase	1
considering price the be specs might this and the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
i fully expect it to go bad again  in the same or some other in the next months because as other down reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy i would not have bought it if it was not for th  way in the next months because would not expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other down reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flims as other down would not expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other down reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy i would not have bought it if it was not for the pric reviewers have plastic pointed  out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
just bought this camera from amazon and already love the features it has	1
i can t rate it higher only because when it is good it is great	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
this has happened and occasionally if we it will work it work one before	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
size one above bigger than the ipod	0
day i turned on connected to the network but no internet connection	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
i t	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
i get to chapter and everything	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
software that sucks up my notebook space but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
only if we could get one camera in it	0
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
it could be at ounces i like the sound i think it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
the nd the player had a faulty usb cable which caused to the computer to not turn on	0
they deliver great sound when hooked a very quiet up and a very loud actually make a receiving a signal	1
not only is it the perfect size it all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
but this camera is great	1
the battery life is very good it only takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
the build quality is top notch	1
in addition it comes with the following	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the rules are also flawed	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
the camera has built in a wonderful set of array features	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the screen is good	1
it really impressed me with the price	1
we own of i very with of the these compact speakers at these here on amazon	1
there is much which has been other about of this phone it is a great phone mine right out of	0
again the cameras were turned on and away from where they should the rest of the time	1
i had a hard time setting up the software and now my favorite cd is transferred	0
they look fantastic	1
this book is highly recommended otherwise	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
super through the a is navigating you especially if easy have owned menus previous model nokia phone	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
i spend hours day dark session with dar in the center of and when i look from the center to the corner of the the screen the colors change colors and brightness looking at the screen and when it gets change across the panel whe in a vnc session with dark colors the the screen the colors change colors and brightness looking at the screen and when it gets change across the panel a vnc session with dark colors the the screen the colors change colors and brightness looking at the screen and when it gets change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner i spend hours in when i look from the center to the corner	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
but after days it still worked but then quit working	0
ripping your songs and creating new ones could nt be any easier	1
navigation system  the zen xtra for example the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your to navigate to the files you want for example uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your to navigate to the files songs	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
am i m giving this player cautious recommendation	0
it works but then it does not work and you are left there wondering what you are doing wrong	0
the monitors were both good	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
you know do so much more with the pc suite i you free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if can e jme you can to how program even make your own apps games	1
great is it see to spot metering switch and actually to it working on the lcd screen	1
unfortunately after a few months of downloading loading songs all i get now is player either not not working connected that is or so busy	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
loved the slim design	1
this phone has a  very cool and useful feature speakerphone this phone the speakerphone	1
not only is it fast and runs very smooth fast but it is also very reliable	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
like other reviewers installation was said it hell	0
i only have one and that is the card game	0
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as i and are truly amazing lrb can be purchased here i think	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
great sound good interface replaceable and easy to use good software wake up timer multiple play modes	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
you you want to rename you if a cd title quite quickly that will become frustrated have already transferred	0
its silver magnesium finish is beautiful and the smooth lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i have used	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
i did not know a thing about how to operate it it was so confusing	0
its going to serve as a back up for my current collection is it	1
the phone the speakerphone is excellent	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
ing to buy one mor when  the matrox g dual new g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super fast cards dvi card comes out new g dual dvi when thematros g i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
also very light and portable	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
the screen is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for some it is not for everyone people say they have a low rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
i try to avoid it but i do not hear anything overly extreme	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
these are incredibly amazing	1
price	1
also the feature to automatically is available put in the song information option is nt always accurate	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
the memory is staggering	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
i love love my new nomad life as a its great	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
i simply love this feature	1
i highly recommend recommend a nokia	1

what really made this great and a mediocre really mp made player for me was the software	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
the scroll wheel over improvement big a is the ipod touchpad	0
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	1

i just set very simple and it up manually which is on my computer very easy	1
bad quality	0
billy joel was nt from when said he you get more mileage a cheep pair of speakers kidding	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
connect the player to your computer open your computer and up mediasource and you to your favorite shows can listen to your stored mp s as listen you can download they stream directly from your computer from the xtra	1
i just wish that they could make it a little bit louder	0
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
i have ice age keeps me no	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0

i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
the is very	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
seems to read most fine and dvds reads quietly	1
great price	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang one of for your buck for the buck	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the make it easy for is that it will cost you catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to but the downside miss precious shots	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
screen brightness is really good	1
