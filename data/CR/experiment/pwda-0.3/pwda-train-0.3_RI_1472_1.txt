the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
able i would not be inclined to purchase an of the market if i was apex product in a position again	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
i spent hours a lot of time on that and trying to get my laptop to work i could nt not get it to connect to the internet	0
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
i is not ready have app is not it played with all the features yet but the camera very good and will be great is easy to use once you get used to it	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1

available the prints are beautiful	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1

i love these nice machines but i low i consider their quality pretty low would say now	0
the quality i will agree come back to but i have site to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
first the cons a tad not bulky not the user friendly most asthetic one of looking player and does nt them is that it is not a music support best looking player the a folder stucture	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the of the app interface software itself which should be user friendly at all the app was simple was not user friendly anything but easy to use	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
