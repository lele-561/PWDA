in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
while there are flaws with some of the games it gets five stars because of them	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
the auto setting does a good job for most people but there are manual settings for those who need them	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
convenience because it works through the internet	1
the screen is a decent size but the power button on the right is small and difficult to press	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my house and my house is located on the top floor of the building and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
working for hours with it on the beach on the rocks	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
no one needs a x mm x or what ever stupid size it is rrb or adapter	0
its great	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
however a quick call to the d c support crew was made in a reasonable amount of time and they walked me through the process of reporting a problem	0
great value for money and for the price you can t beat it	1
possibly the best feature this phone has is the fact that the user can charge him herself by charging and popping in the new battery	1
longer battery life easier access to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
i thought i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only had a couple of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for the first time i followed the instructions for the second time	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the quality is excellent	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
keep in mind that your subject is no more than about feet tall the lighting conditions are brilliant and the indoor conditions are very good too	1
this is extremely small and it will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
other than that it is great	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
apple is bigger than the ipod	0
it is the most important thing for the kids out there	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my stuff done in minutes and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
i bought this router and expected to get a good deal but these random disconnects kills it for me https www amazon com gp product b a c f ref sr	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
i ve been there and done that at the same time and while it does work the whole experience is not the same for me	0
a vivid clean screen wide viewing angle and best of all great viewing angles	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
please consider this a far superior piece of hardware before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
the name itself has all sorts of meanings	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1

my other big complaint about it is the price	0
i dont like apex but love amazon and i like amazon	0
this phone is a great little phone its got great features a great screen size and battery life	1
it is the command line interface on the server to be used either for nas or print server	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
my mom needed this computer she said so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing it home	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
much faster than my previous acer one did	1
it was simple to set up and has been working well for the last year to few months but i have had it	1
i have found that the book is very easy to read if you have a basic knowledge of a few things	1
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
it works and looks great if you can get the hang of how easy it is to play	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
i m easily the only person i know with this in picture quality and not even at the best possible setting as yet	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
one thing i have found that i havent liked is that it is hard to read in daylight but it is readable at night thanks	1
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
they were both good	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i tried e mailing them and they come back as undeliverable	0
in fact each of my favorite players had never played in the first place	1
we are the sound people for computers i can t understand why they don t use us	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
honestly i love this player	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
i think i would recommend this router in every home with large or small buisiness environmnets	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward little lock out button that you have to press to get it to work	0
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to sit in its place this is why it sucks	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life for my laptop and lower price i found both	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
i contacted them and they helped me install the new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
it varies but i would estimate you get about the same amount of money that you would from	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1

in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful design	1
fragile	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive product for a while and then it disappeared	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
mp the optical zoom lens is absolutely beautiful and filled with detail that challenges all of the above cameras easy to set up and use a lot of features and it comes with a warranty and last but not least it has my fiance is stamp of	1
on average indoor shots with a distance of are not as accurate as mm	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
it feels solid it does not shake or vibrate while playing discs and the sound quality is top notch	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
something tells me that i will in the long run be at least on a different computer one on which i can t create folders or at least a very small one in which i vow never to buy products from again	0
the ihome is not perfect but it is clearly superior	1
i like the picture bright colors and very light weight i think it worked like a charm	1
how you can connect to more than one computer	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
changing brightness is done with four users and one user can change brightness but i leave that at minimum brightness for at night use	1
finally i have my hands down the best deal for t mobile as a carrier	0
the image that is captured does not leave you with a good image at all but is unusable after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
it does tend to get quite hot and should be kept cool with plenty of room for air circulation	0
be prepared for a long wait for this but the wait was worth it	0
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
the mms technology is fully integrated with this app which you will find here	1
i ve listened to all of these discs and they all play well	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
it looks and feels quite small to me and very small	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
this has happened with us and if we keep doing something it will happen again when it did not before	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
it is excellent as one would suspect from the title the guardian	1
the buttons are easy to use and the buttons are quick to use	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
no but it has a cool screen why not use it	1
this thing is awesome	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
there is nothing which has been said negative about the performance of this phone it is a great phone mine and without any problems it flies out of the box	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
slow to download and run certain programs i have tried and hope my review helped	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which would allow me to easily play the games i want to play and the zen xtra is the only one that meets those criteria	0
my other gripe is the price which is higher than other cheaper apex models	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point buy it now	1
this is the third apex product i have produced and they continue to improve	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
in addition it may mean	1
i just made it up myself which is very cool	1
the wines are excellent as is the legendary quality of the food he said very good	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
now there is one more complaint i have about it and that is the software that comes with it for processing mbyte data i only had it in mbyte mode and all i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1

i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
picture quality is excellent	1
and the truth is there is no doubt about that	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has a lot for me to grow into	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the money came from my credit card	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
i ve sold every electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
my first impression was positive	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and took some spectacular images	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very sturdy look	1
you can do other cool things with it such as make a video of it you can make it as modern or classical	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
awesome sound quality	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
if you want to get a great product delivered on time buy this one	1
the benefits that come with it are nt that great	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
going through the menus is super easy especially if you have a good memory enjoy	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving the support call	0
i especially love the fact that with it is big knob and all	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i am disappointed in the lack of entertaining games on this phone	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
great quality of life and features	1
the top that keeps the battery from poping off without the aid of a touch of the latch	1
the second set is working just fine	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds before you can select one of the sub menu items and click that apply button	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
i have had no problems at all	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is not very good looking it needs a tripod instead of a camcorder and it is slow between shots	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital release available today enjoy	1
megapixels is great and the video quality is awesome	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
when you have this book in your pocket you forget it is there it is so simple and so beautiful	1

all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
material support	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
i thought it was bad enough it was too complicated to do at all	1

because it can be a so so to take spectacular photos	1
the downside is that autofocus does not work properly when battery is low	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
it is not clear	0
screen was good easy to read	1
i highly recommend it	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
you have to scroll to the bottom and frequently i end up pressing the wrong button when i want to scroll	0
but i have spoken to some creative tech people about it and they said they will fix it for me if necessary	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
with all of the features are easily accessible and the quality of service is great	1
these speakers are great but they will die if you leave them on with no batteries	0
both of the problem with this is that it repeatedly pauses during playback while the counter on the player is going	0

i highly recommend it	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
setup software i found the setup software on the enclosed cd file	0
screen was bright and easy to read	1
it is worth it	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
you can create playlists drag them to your player and play them directly from cd player	1

the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1

usb	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
cameras are a big deal on this camera	1
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
overall i like the unit	1
i am absolutely in awe of how you put enormous quality into it	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
even better with the addition of bluetooth you can listen to your music over the integrated radio	1
the game was free to play as long as you have an active user account	0
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
the phone has a few problems but only because it lacks those features like gps and the internet but there are very few problems with the things that you need this phone to do	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
what really made this project work for me was the software	1

be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
at the very least a little more protective gear in the case would be nice	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
and it works great too	1
the sound is surprising loud and clear with a good amount of detail for such a small unit	1
it also has unproven battery life	0

battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1

there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
i quickly learned how to use it and can play any song on youtube etc fast enough	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1

my only real complaint is the quality	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
the picture is very nice and you can connect it to your tv and could use it that way if you want to	1

speed and range speed	1
billy boy was not kidding when he said you get more mileage from a lot of speakers	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
my apologies if you were disappointed with the quality of the pictures i took	0
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the pictures are on the right side of on screen which i like because that is where my eyes are and that is when i hold the thing	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
but if you want a great deal and a great experience then you should get the nomad	1
for the most part this is true	1

the plan is okayed	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the computer is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
very good value for the money	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
they sound great in my head and i have not even touched any of them	1
the sound quality is good the battery life is excellent the fact that it is waterproof is excellent and finally the price is better than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
i can t give it one star only because when it happens it happens	0
the plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
images taken from the video were nt so clear	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0

the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
as a portable player it should feel good	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
for example this allows you to listen to as well as play your favorite music and movies in an offline setting	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is a great monitor for your health	1
this app has many other features ir just to name a few i think	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0

saying that s not what you are doing it for it is nice but that is nt a reason to do it	1

my only complaint is that the cord is too short	0
after a lengthy and extensive search for a fully loaded high performance travel camera i have finally come to this little gem because of the great picture quality mega pixel	1

the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	1

even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
overall i like the system features and performance	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i have not yet seen any of them with the pictures so i am not sure	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
the storage capacity is great	1
to my amazement even that process was possible	1
i have been on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to call and wait at all my phone is back online	1

halfway through the router progress is slow the web browser is not found screen and most of the router is interface	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
i love this player	1

big and small and excellent when it comes to downloading music apps and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
the fact that this model would work with mpeg was a big deal for me as a graphic artist and i discovered by accident that it will work with any mpeg file on a cd r or disk with vcd formatting	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
however everything on this new router worked of course	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
what is worse is the difference in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the screen size and resolution are unlimited	1
anyways back to the point i was trying to be so calm over the whole process of dealing with this and	0
views from one of the most extreme viewing angles ca nt nt	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0
my blu ray player and my blu ray box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke while watching a movie and perform well forever thereafter	1

no option for more pictures or videos	0
this book is not worth reading and i recommend that you do not purchase it	0
it is slow supposedly it is slow	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
if you are not picky then go for it	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the picture is perfect but i am not watching on an hdtv	0
without a doubt the best looking apex predator in the world that i ve seen	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the picture with the click of a button and it has an optional manual focus mode that can be really helpful if you have a camera that is hard to use	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
it really helped me with the disign the specs the first time	1
i do nt really care for it but it allows easy editing of the image	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
great phone	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
sound quality is so bad i can t really upload it to the ipod	0
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it	1
i wish my new nomad its success	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever seen	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
i did the same thing about a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
fortunately the metz has a hot shoe that can make an amazing flash and fortunately for me i have a one of the best flashes that money can buythe metz	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
this is a very good phone for less than with long battery life	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
they caused the problem to be fixed in the first place because the service tech failed to believe what the software said was true	0
it may	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
i m using this player for recommendation	1
i lived in a small college apartment the e s and f s were beautiful but not for what i wanted	1
software development	1
the digital camera takes as good of pictures as the real camera does	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the system is small in size and design imo looking better than the competition	0
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
bottom line is for the price these things are great and worth it	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
takes more photos	0
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
they sound really good and just as the reviews say	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
great minds	1
i m not easily impressed by people who pretend to be a little bit but she really deserves it	1
i find it very useful for transferring large files	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
so if you re looking for a little fiddling you may be very happy with this one	1
for the price there is no other option	1
i have not even started my new job yet and already i am disapointed	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
i thought it had good power but not much at all	1
i like the fact i can talk about it in public and write about it	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
after we got the message we tried to call them but we never got through with them the customer support number is always busy and they do not answer our calls	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
worked out	1
but the sound quality is excellent and works well on my portable speakers	1
only if we have at least one camera in it	0
the fact that support and technical support are slow and nonresponsive tells you about the company and their ability to stand behind them sic	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
i tried calling the phone number a couple of times a day and always got a busy signal	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the lcd is much brighter than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which helps to illuminate the screen more successfully than the lcd which is green and did	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the picture is clear and bright and the sound is good	1
this laptop will change your idea of what a laptop should be	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i tried to use the radio transmitter unit with it it worked fine when i set it on the radio but was useless when trying to use it in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
it was easy to unbox and install	0
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
the pictures are razor sharp too	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i have been playing around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of results i have there too	1
install the software to your computer with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
very simple to use	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
it seems that with this the router is	1
my wife is even more pleased than i am	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
x zoom is used	1
my only complaint is that sometimes it wont download from the cloud and it is really annoying when it does because it takes forever	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
i do not like this phone but unforutnately i am happy	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0

i knew this was a cheap monitor as soon as i saw it	0
the weather is nice	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
seems to read most dvds fine and dandy	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
range of functions as shown above it has basic functions for everyone to use and shoot and advanced functions for those who are serious shooters	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
i also did not like the way it displayed the time down into the screen when you are in a hurry	0
great quality picture and features	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
however for a budget camera i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
the bag is very light and slim and fits easily into my purse or purse stand	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the build quality is top notch	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this phone delivers both	1
what is product support is that this is not limited to the zen it is also applicable to what is products	1
but if you ve got it the controls are there	0
this camera has a cool new feature to it just click here to move on to canon is website	1
this is awesome but if you put it too high it depends on yoursound quality the glass might crack	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
this is an excellent value	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
i am bored to tears	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
the ease of navigating while listening to music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
even after following some of the instructions it is still difficult to use	0
there is an alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
due to the lack of support for the upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the last one i was very unimpressed	0
it is easy for you to keep it open to see what else you re listening to	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
when i got it back i discovered that the menu options for sending messages to my friends were not there	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
no headphone jackno headset jack	0
the main problem with the new version of the xtra gb is the software	0
neither message was answered	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i am familiar with the onscreen displays i	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
for the long term it is a well worth investment	1
however my first attempt at it did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
while i had the phone there were good sound quality and an excellent battery life phone and earpiece	1
it works great	1
very tight fit excellent black finish and precise speaker wire placement	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
it may	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
i think i think the satellites look ugly	0
numbers can be adjusted for personal preference	1
good range speed	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
you can use the zen xtra files that are embedded in the mp files to organize your files enjoy	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
easy to hook up	1
only one complaint is that you can only use the speakerphone feature once the person you are talking to is on the phone not while it is	0
i got both of these players for christmas gifts and both are awesome	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
in which others are not bright enough	0
the size of	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
having usb ports	1
i do nt think that really matters though i did hook it up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
seriously i love it	1
overall the avr produces a great sound with excellent clarity the company has done well on all of these fronts	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
it has a few advantages one is that they do not have to play one after another game	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
good luck life	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
value of	1
in the navigation by folders is ok however i miss an option to navigate by folders	0
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
there was also a lip sync issue	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of performance and battery life	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
the auto mode works well but i dont like having the auto modes they are dummy proof and not suited to situations in which i would ever seek to use the camera	0
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
the memory is staggering	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
i was looking into buying an imac pro that had more than one screen and this seemed to be the best in that category	1
it is wonderful not only does it open the shutter it can also be used to open and close the shutter	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
i m not one who likes to spend money so this phone exceeded and surpassed my needs	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
this was an old player before the video output no longer works	0
the headphones are great but you can really only get so much out of the little headphones you insert in	1
the final insult is that while this app comes with useful software to make sharing easier because it is only a trial version you have to download the full version from the internet then pay an exorbitant amount to some unknown company to get	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
but i do nt like to do it on the computer because the clip is small and the screen can slip off	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
i think i have two subs in there that should help you enough if i am not the bass player	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
my brother in law has an apex tv and it was a great experience for the money	1
this is a list	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
this app is awesom but it will only help you and you can never want more than to have a open source app if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be happy and very secure this app is well worth	1
feel like the plastic is feels like it will break very easily and it definately wont last long	0
overall i love this camera and i would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
the router failed and the lrb went dead on me when i tried to work from home due to heavy snow	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
i have viewed numerous different monitor models that i own and this particular monitor had as poor of a display as any i have seen	0
i am disappointed and will look elsewhere for a company that can withstand the rigor of a lawsuit	0
i m sorry so here is the link	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
other things that i like are voice mail dialing and email	0
i selected the right away and have gotten the same results every time	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
i recently got the canon powershot g and am loving it	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my blog but its not as easy as when i posted them on facebook	0
i am very happy with this app and will be using it often	1
it is small so it easily fits in a pocket	1
at ounces it is very light but not as light as	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i sent my monitor in to be repaired for repairs for such a long time of constant buzzing from my gd hz monitor	0
it will only move the monitor from side to side and no up down or left to right feature rrb	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
the results are amazing	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see it and if the button did not bring up the screen	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
conclusion i was ready to pay attention to all the speakers but i couldnt find them	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
i suck i need to invest in some cool stuff since it has the eax feature	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
my only concern is that it happened more than once and i am not sure why do i not know if it was a virus or if it of the router	0
other than that this thing is great	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and great camera	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
i would reccomend these to someone who is looking for a set of high quality computer speakers at a reasonable price thanks	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the smaller size	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
user replaceable battery	1
this is by far the finest book in english i have ever read	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
it will nt play all of my movies	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
overall good for the price	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
i i wo nt say anything bad as you are just right the web cam is a good light source and it works	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
awesome sound system	1
it did slow down a few times while i was working and i had to reboot but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just to start up again	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
samsung galaxy s has a major design flaw	0
what a day	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and use	1
awesome camera with lots of features in a tiny package	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
i am able to carry it with me to my work in places where they are not so easily accessible	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
for the games and features it supports	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
overall an excellent phone	1
the grain was good	1
the system used to be better designed	0
this is wonderful to have you back	1
the software is not good enough and the sound has no compatibility with other sound blaster devices which is very disappointing	0
all the other acer stuff is top notch	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
it is free and it is feature complete	1
very long battery lifevery short battery life	0
i d like to say that because of it is quality it is the best pc stereo system out there right now	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i spent hours playing in the dark with dark colors the colors and brightness change on the panel when i switch from black to white	0
with mediasource being so easy i found it hard not to use it for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the new software can be confusing and may take a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some have indicated	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
they fired away and the shots rang out quite loudly	1
can t beat carrying cd s with me when i travel	0
i have had it for a while now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
mediasource is an application with the following features	1
i love this monitor	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
had a dog that was years old and i lost him but the onkyo dog is still alive	1
very happy with the monitor and the results	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i had no problems setting up my account and now it is transferred	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
this is what i ve purchased	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
it is better than the s	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
i have had it for a month now and i am very pleased with it	1
also very light and portable	1
this router is phenomenal	1
and it works for me too	1
the price tag looked just right	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
another point of contention is the battery life is limited	0
the hot shoe flash attachment allows me to buy and use a sophisticated camera for my work	1

i find all of the controls very intuitive and not flimsy in the least	1
also i can t understand why the app does not work the when it is on the server	0
i would like it to be done again in the same or some other way in the future but i am not sure because as other people have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
easy enough to navigate through but i d prefer a scroll wheel instead of the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
based on the features listed above it is a great piece of hardware for doing what it was meant to do to begin with but the future is a mystery	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search engine is not very fast even when you search it with google	0

a great system at an incredible price	1
playlists can be made on the fly without the need for a playlist manager and you can use different modes like shuffle and repeat for your playlist selections or playlists	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
the problem is that the fastest thing that has happened to it has been around forever even when in the same place	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
great speakers overall	1
some people have problems with the small hole on the bottom that is on the front cover has not been an issue for me and is not noticeable if you look closely as the case may be	1

what a day	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1

my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
so far the router is working	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
transfers are very quick through usb	1
bookmarks are an important feature but not on all browsers	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
it is not for beginners to use but has features that most people will find useful so it is an excellent tool to get into	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover art its awful	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
now that i own it though i can t imagine not being able to use it	0

it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
again the numbers are not shown and projected from where they should the center of the tv	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
it does this in all aspects of life	1
overall small is great and less expensive than apple pie	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
i have used this for years and it is a great tool	1
it may	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
overall i am giving this a b as i ve seen nothing of the sort i have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i have only had the player for a month i have room for doubt if the same issues or similar problems show	1
and the overall construction quality has quite a bit of a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the previous model	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the screen is bright enough to read but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you look too long it is very easy to read and read	1
the software is simple but i found the entire process to be mastered	0

it has a nice color screen	1
bottom line well designed and easy to use very fast and powerful camera to include the ability to change the aperture and lense filters choices	1
i get home and everything freezes	1
you of course will have some good customization options with your phone as well	1
i found this in the manual and once online it is very easy there is a plugin which will work with your os if you need it	1
we own two of these and i am very pleased with the quality of the these and especially at the price that these sell for here on ebay	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
great camera great investment	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
i have to say i m a little disappointed by the user interface for playing cd rs dvds that are stored on cd rsdvds	0
ipod vs gb ipod for the price	0
canon is g	0
the bottom line is that it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to entertain its music	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
the software is slow and just plain does not load on some computers	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the bluetooth earpiece is very responsive and easy to use	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1

this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
the volume range is adjustable so you can adjust	0
with a light weight and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
pictures wo can be transferred to your computer directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
i have had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve ever owned and used in my life	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
it is a collection of my movies which are all store boughten	0
if you are looking for a small camera or a large camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
it is harder than i thought but as it turns out its worth it	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome plugin	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
i have tried many times to get hold of a rep who does nt answer and the number is constantly busy as the phone is ringing the customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
my dwl ap does not work as it should and there is no way to use this product	1
i dont recommend a nokia	1
it may	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
surfing the beach is fun as well i just wish there were more places available	1
the woofer is large	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
video output stopped workin	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
granted i have only been at it for about hours setting it up for the first time for me but that was enough for me to fall in love with this new player	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it for very audible conversations with friends and family	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
its fast forward and rewind faster than those of other apps i use	0
depressing that the system is not always responsive	0
overall a sweet machine	1
the monitor works very well with it	1
however if you want to build a house across the street and these are your requirements then this company will do the job	1
i have it locked up and will not do anything now i will when i get home	0
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
the scene mode works really well for the types of scenes that are not meant to be in a static setting	1
despite this minor flaw i highly recommend the canon g to anyone who is serious about canon	1
i think the hard drive just died one day before my class	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
i had to get rid of it i thought some of the latest windows software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reboot it and my computer far too often in frustration	0
value comparing data storage with price	1
there are limits to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in frequency control	0
easy enough but it did not work	0
while the majority of it was good i was turned off by the part about more than what i expected	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
so that it is not mistaken for files of any size or format	1
both units are small with similarly sized weapons	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1

the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
the design is very attractive and the color screen has good resolution	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i have not had a problem with it and am more comfortable with it than any i ve had	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
i think that limited lifetime warranty is good but it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
how much power this slim design puts out	1
the software on the router is	0
overall rating	1
harmless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
the software is	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
it is small	1
this is a little hard to understand	0
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful and helpful tech	1
windows mediaplayer as windows mediaplayer is effective in many ways and is linked to a good cddb service it is a good mediasource although not as good as others	1
this app is useful at times when you listen to a variety of music as it will adjust the volume for you which can be helpful enjoy	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
the hardware and the software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
i like the battery well and it has a good lifespan	1
but you do nt have to be you can	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
sharp image	1
mid range is nt great but it is still there and should appeal to those not looking to spend money on computer speakers	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
it was from to at which the system failed completely	0

i can not get it to play any media it does not play windows media and i can not play any music	0
it is a little hard to get through the crowd to get to what you want	0
this app is a replacement for your desktop	1
for the price of the sound that comes out of it	1
i like how the lighting and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its easy to use if you do nt want to bother with the controls enjoy	0
i try to do it from what is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
its like when you ask for a compliment and it does nt come as it should straight out of the mouth	1

overall i like it	1
price gb of oil	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain of the year	1
it does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error https www youtube com watch v x m m m vk feature youtu be	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
best in class sound	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
nice and all	1
best group of support i have ever experienced	1

i love this player and would love to play with creative players again	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
the replacable battery is removable so once it wears out you will be able to replace it	0
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
power is very powerful	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
samsung galaxy note is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
and really this is just one example	1
your comments are great	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
the second video was released about two weeks before the video came out	0
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
i did not get any wierd sounds from the speakers like i did with my other speakers	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could not restart the computer no matter how many times i rebooted my pc and reloaded it all i need is online support	0
the router has obviously been tampered with before and numerous other things	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
you can see the full list in the map finder	0
seems like a good product	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the customer service is very rude	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
i tried accessing and editing the files to find it to be empty	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
all in all this is a great tool for anyone who has a small portable computer and needs a lapdesk and some speakers	1
i think i like it	1
we have a very rich and deep bass but obviously not the kind of bass for which you would need a subwoofer	0
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
sharp enough	1
volume level is	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
i had this set it up and would not change it	0
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definitely the best bang for the buck	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
when the screen was nt working or glitching the overall performance of the game was poor to fair	0
recieved this product in the mail for a gift and it works outstanding good battery life nice high resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses and connects to my network easily	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
so far the router has worked well	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass level the sound comes outs exceedingly well	1
it has very good range much better than the others	1
the story of g is perhaps the best out there	1
it also has a stock tracking system and a somewhat useful calculator which converts all types of currencies	0
what a disappointment	0
i think youll love this feature	1
the only reason i don t give it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to read so you can t see it thanks	0
easy to do but it did not work	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
this was my first nonflip phone and i was so excited that i decided to go with them	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
i have gb out of space in that space i loaded my whole collection of music which is nt that many songs and i	1
as a tech person i was able to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in my car	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
key words	1
the new one was much better than the original one which was now working fine	1
great picture	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
we tried to leave and when we got back the car started to freeze for no reason	0
with this app you can improve your sound with a few tweaks which is pretty good you can get away with it	1
my life is ok	1
i found the apex ad to be a great buy	1
well this one does the same wonders for me	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
sub woofer is large	1
the site is heavily back logged and can t keep up with everything don t worry	0
i will not be able to purchase an apex product again	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
it may	1
the power jack seems to be working	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
it has a lot of little cute features such as being the camera and the pim and the radio	1
good battery life	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
i think this is great	1
loved the slim design	1
this router is the best i have used so far	1
these speakers are great	1
it does not have an optical focus assist light which is useful for photography in low light situations as it allows the subject to focus	0
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the world is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
tough but otherwise fine	0
i m very happy with these i would like to see more for the front channels	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
the colors and everything are great	1
i cant believe the storage in this thing	0
i think this is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
i am delighted with this product	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it works and does nt get in the way	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
a great achievement for a hard drive based player the performance is better than that on other devices as well	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
it had a heavier and heavier weight	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
it does nt have firewire not on it since they do nt seem to have firewires themselves	0
it would make sense and then show us that there is	1
this is amazing	1
i have windows installed and when i opened the window i did receive a message that there was a problem	0
you can stop reading now this is what you will find today as i am writing this on my phone	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
some features in the user interface	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
its not perfect but when you can instantly delete pics you do not like that are not in focus or need lighting adjustments it makes this camera very simple and effective	0
it also has its own problem for me when i turn it on and it keeps shutting down which means i have to turn it off and turn it back it on again which is not to my likings	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i love you	1
mediasource did not work on my personal notebook	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
it is equipped with lot of features	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
it is very light in weight and size	1
but about of dvd is i have a bit of a problem when watching a movie it will freeze but the movie still plays and eventualy the movie comes back in after skipping it	0
it is very easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
sound quality is very good it also doubles as a radio which is a great option when you are bored	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
i remain very pleased with this router	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
got a text message error problem days after purchase	0
i am a lawyer apex cust service no help	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
all in all bad day bad night run like hell from this place	0
after looking at it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in my bag	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with simple controls that can be adjusted	1
it plays pretty much every game i ve bought so far except for the one that i ripped years ago and the rental one that can nt be played on my old sharp player	1
the light auto steering is awesome	1
setup time from start to completely finished and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
but it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we got rid of it we bought a new one for our two computers	0
these along with the replaceable battery were the main driving factors on why i picked the nomad	1
i ve been burned by blown out windows on the s and i want to do something about it	0
the screen is very easy to see in bright sunlight with nice colors	1
this system has now failed me twice in the same period of time mentioned	0
but i think this dvd player is one of the best out there	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
with this amount of storage i have about gb on the player with room for more	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the color is so beautiful and is so attractive	1
the data rate over the network storage is a bit slow but i only use it for a few minutes so it does not bother me too much	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
this is extemely lame	0
they will not be happy and he is constantly busy	0
just an average user with no interest in this product	0
the website which should be user friendly was anything but easy to navigate afp relaxnews	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i just screwed it up and everything went to shit	0
both are very easy to learn use and easy enough to understand	1
and it holds sooooo much music and memories	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
it has many great features and very few bugs	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
my nvidia card it was easy to set up and works as promised with my nvidia card	1
the option was to go with the windows home professional instaled but other netbooks with windows installed doesnt allow and i forgot to mention this especially with the increased price	0
i found this to be a great idea	1
bottom line i have a better sound system in my house than i had on my old lrb at least to my ears and for less than half the cost	1
the quality of the player is sound quality is superior to average	1
it does not only have trouble playing dvd movies it also has trouble properly playing movies	0
when i heard the sound of plastic where there was no sound i was concerned that the sound was	1
speakerphone	1
the pictures are great and their is more to it there are tons of them i have yet to get to	1
the main screen has a button for me to put all my files on it or on the dell rrb and edit them	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
but it was only with one so overall it wasnt bad	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
neither message was returned	0
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
but canon never ceases to amaze	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
works super well	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the new one is very easy to use and easy to set up	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
the camera is a little slow to operate at times but offers tremendous flexibility in automatic and manual modes	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
bright visible light	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
a week out of the hospital and i began to see the bruises from the surgery more frequent each day	0
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
and with usb transferring files to your player is easy	0
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
this thing is trash	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
hooked up to the d link and down to mbps and then back up to m	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
too difficult to find genre and track information for large number of tracks	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
because she is beautiful	1
creative labs customer support website http www creativelabs com	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
the software sucks	0
the rate plans are not very good at all for me	0
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
these speakers are more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i have ever heard	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i had to use the musicmatch software already on my computer to load the music onto this unit	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
i am using them in my life and they generally work	1
i will never know what this kid is capable of	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
his voice is very exceptable	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
first the cons are bulky not the most portable music player and does not support a folder system	0
the bad news is that it comes with a price tag and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it has a long battery life with excellent signal hands free speakerphone and support for java apps	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was successfully recognized but the other was not recognized and was not available	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
excellent battery life hours per charge	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
im lucky enough to integrate my clarion organ to my toyota camry car it is awesome	1
it is made of plastic	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
these are the best places for the weekend cycling in the park	1
we got them for the t ball game plan and they came with them and one died today after less than a week of use	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t select any of the items to choose from you have to scroll down to find what you re looking for	0
i have had this camera for a year and i nt give it up for anything	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the connection is not always and constantly there	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
the instructions that come with it do nt say how to use it	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
i find it too bright	0
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the zoom range is increased in magnification which is nice but there is also a display of the zoom about of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with the zoom	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and there is no disc	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
mixed bag i guess but i like it	1
what is missing from creative is a cd burner	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
storage space	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the scroll bar is a pain enough said	0
the camera did a great job converting the light to fill of the screen and the screen still looked normal	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
the sounds were as the music directors wanted them	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
i have no idea what is on this and have barely touched it	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
the system stores data files but does not allow them nor does it allow them to be deleted or modified to be changed	0
i am looking forward to having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as tons of media stored in it	0
t is which does not appear for several long stretches on the map	1
i definatley recommend this system and its volume can be used in a small house for such a small speaker system	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
image clarity is lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with lrb and noticed the difference in the image	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
for the money apex court may have said	0
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
now when the backlight comes on i have to turn it off and it comes on the next day	0
gps has a wonderful set of features	1
the player is mechanics are also important	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo only works if you take a photo with it on which is not recommended	0
and for some reason the picture is washed out and blurry with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
another nice thing is that the unit has a digital memory card slot but the latter was not available in the store so i d scanned before buying	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
i love these machines but i consider their value pretty low now	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
the remote is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
worked fine	1
very easy to scroll in and out etc	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the list is long but if you have questions you should be able to answer	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
its completely useless as is since it doesnt work	0
d link support is broken and i tried to fix it but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
on my main page the software is	0
but after days the camera still worked but the video was lost	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
nothing but the best with this company	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is the only thing that worked without taking it off the road	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
does what it should and the future seems bright	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the camera comes with a manual and the very best camera app which has optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the colours are nice no question about it the price is reasonable for the size the range is what you might expect from a product of this size lrb perhaps even better than some of the others	1
great product works great for my office	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
this is so lame	0
received the dvd and it was working fine when set up with s connector	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i hope you like it	1
i do not for the life of myself having any issues with it in the future but if i do i will know that it will be taken care of for free and quick with the help and support of the reps of amazon in	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
overall i like it	1
no problems with dropped signals compared to the netgear router it replaced which only lasted a few months	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
the combination of the price of the product and player features makes this player the best player on the market	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the speakerphone the radio all features are available	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the macro lens is great for macro photographs and the flash is terrific for point and shoot	1
overall this camera delivers what may be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color point of view	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
her response was prompt	1
i have sent my dvd player back to the store because it wont play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to be working	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
in this case it is not a convenient data storage device only but the one you need for your music collection	0
easy to use a lot of reviews and comments	1
key instead	0
it is small but big value for money	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
it has a usb port so you can use it in your computer and have network accessible storage	1
great speakers are	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
the one we tried did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
i have this for years on my truck and i m very happy with it but it is loud and annoying however you are welcome to use it for i	0
i love you and am extremely happy	1
i just finished my first zen xtra yesterday and i am extremely happy with it	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i really have no control over this	0
there is an alarm i dont know what it is but it should be good	1
this camera is mounted on a tripod in auto mode with a loud sound which can t be heard	0
very bad news	0
the quality is excellent	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
like i said installation was hell	0
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
the only problem is the speaker wire is very short	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at all due to inaccurate placement from the sub woofer no matter how you position it	0
it will fit in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
the second set is over just like that	0
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
it is very comfortable and nice to use and the display is good as well	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
looks like a very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
software the software industry	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency conversion and a built in camera	1
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
picture quality in mm is indistinguishable from mm	1
the manual is simple and it is mostly intuitive	1
this is the reason why it does nt work as well as i d like i d like it	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon or amazon com	0
good looks	1

the eax sound enhancement feature did not do anything and the custom eq feature did	0

how this product was created and was left behind	0

it has to and i can do it	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
when i first tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more complex dvd r games that is that other players would play but i was able to play the ones that i knew that i could not get to before in the	1
with it enabled when we got home we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the console because the gui one would nt work	0

the size is small	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
the camera lever the one which switches between capture and view mode	0
yes the picture and features which are too numerous to mention are available for purchase in this book	1

its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
no matter the outcome	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
what are the reasons and or reasons that you think this thing is not ready for prime time	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
the quality is superb	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the mp cd and the zen xtra sounds great	1
the monitors were both good	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
i just read this and i have to say that i love it	1
you can be far away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i am so happy that netgear is product quality customer service that i will always recommend netgear products to everyone i know	1
it didnt so i ended up posting it on here	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
technical support rude and unprofessional	0
the game is fun but if your not on top of it you lose	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
the optical zoom works very well and the x and y zoom is very good although pictures at the highest digital zoom are very blurry	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was also used	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1

progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
seriously this thing has everything that you could want	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output stopped	0

how to pair	1
i get complete coverage of everything in my house for free and it is located in front of my house	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
the size is a little bit smaller than the original and it weighs a little more more	0
as often as not the scroll tab is either not easy to use or horrible	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
it is more than days and it does not have a name	0
for those of us that like to write i am a creative writer	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
setup was very simple	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
the zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you want to if from now on your only option is to buy it enjoy	1
i did not know a thing about how to operate it it was so confusing	0
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
what you do get is what you pay for in reliable products	1
the build quality is top notch	1
not only is it fast and runs very fast but it is also very quiet	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i am very pleased with this	1
but when we got to the house there was sound but no picture	0
the battery life seems good and you can listen to music while it charges and there is no delay between songs	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
i hope this year we will have more success in creative and the for the year no questions asked it will be worth it since creative will only be it for me which in itself is great	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
and since he has it for such a good price how can you go wrong	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
both the black and the white versions are economically priced and available	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
even when you reboot it will upon reboot keep saying your password is invalid even when it will try and force you to tell it that it is authorized	0
very good range and there seems to be no problem in the horizontal position	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
the screen is bright and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
the other controls are all the same	0
all pictures included are mine and did i mention they are mine	1
the world	0
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily happy with but i do really enjoy the opportunity to play	0
second the payment system and the system are poorly designed	0
sometimes the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but it happens	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i agree with those who say that there is a very limited amount of viewing time in order to achieve this contrast	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
so yes as with all software that comes with a gui it was useless and ugly	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
would definitely buy again because of the customer service	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
your health is fine	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the system was nowhere near stable and it was in alpha stage of development	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
color screen is good	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables the modem attached to this wireless router to be used in the actual home so that you can access portals and be able to drag and drop files etc	1
overall i like it	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
a few of my work constituants the book and highly recommended the canon to me	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield the same results on the other mode	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the picturers are amazing	1
this did nt bother me at all because it is still a decent size	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the sun is shining and within minutes of opening my eyes i was out and about walking to work	1
delivery was prompt	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
one complaint the surface is too easily scratched	0
despite its being much larger than i expected i must admit i was surprised to see how small it was when i opened the door	1
they re pretty comfortable to use and deliver a decent level of quality	1
best camera ever from the image quality to the function i can say that	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
deficiencies with zennx are not the same as with rd party earphones and software	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the only minor issues i have with the camera are the lens and the lens itself	0
since it would not work as advertised i decided to contact support	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
i think there is some sort of benefit in the bose headphones that i do nt know of rrb but i feel that they were over priced for the price	1
this is the future and what a future it is	1
other than that this is a great book and i would still purchase this all over again	1
but i njeh	0
i have tried several times to contact them through their on line web site and their phone number but they wo not answer my emails and their telephone number is disconnected	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
i love it and bought a new one as a birthday present for my parents at first i was hesitant about the price but i ve been impressed with it	1
it takes a while to come back lrb i have also timed it rrb which does nt seem that bad until you get back in the car and that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours lrb	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is still pretty good despite what i have seen though it may still work better	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
it is just such a nice and not intrusive device which you can use	1
the included earbuds were not included	0
set up wpa with no problems	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
my one issue with the test is that despite pulling i tag data from the cdds service the test still fails to work	0
no dead pixels	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
this camera has canon is great and plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
huge storage space even at full capacity you can store a lot of stuff on this thing	1
i needed three batteries to charge myself up with the s but the battery life is good	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the quality is excellent	1
u s military base would not close	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
this product is not available	0
i love it	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
our special friends at creative music made this thing good sound quality great features great price and great sound quality	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
the pictures come out better if your hands are free even for a moment during the taking of the pictures	0
despite me giving kudos to eax for music quality i experienced some issues using eax	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
it would either not have worked at all or it would have worked wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
the problem is that it is connected to nokia so the headphones will not work	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
silverish finish really adds a special touch	1
but this one is great	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
i think i mentioned it the other day but the headphone craze just sort of fizzled out	0
the grain was terrible	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
great price	1
it also does not have a dialing big minus	0
they do a great job when theyre up and actually receiving a signal	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this device boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive user interface that is easy to use good support on id tags and excellent sound	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i tried to get the apex to intervene and it took months to get through to their legal dept	0

here is the brief description of the product it is plastic it feels kind of plastic like but not	0
it works but then it does not work and you are left there wondering what you are doing wrong	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
its nice to have something as a back up for my laptop and the collection is a huge plus	1

ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
what about the dvr what if it can t play some of your favorite dvds	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1

last night i forgot to reset the router	0
the quality is very good	1
after all my experience with that carrier is terrible and horrible customer service portability seemed to sent	0
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1

the software i use however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound much better with it than without it	0

i have nt had time to really push this out to the public but audio and video on youtube are satisfactory as should be	1

this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
great phone i lufton	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0

it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
software the software is crap	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
after about an hour it starts skipping like the rest of the house is are dirty	0
however as with all films in this genre you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
i like it a lot but it is not terribly flashy	1
i am in love with this app it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and features	1
i find it interesting	1
as it turns out the case is pretty straightforward unless you have the time to set up or if you load up all your gear beforehand	0

the bomb goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1

download mp s from the xtra click on the player to open it and you can listen to your stored mp s as they are downloaded	1
i t	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
not only is it cheap but its a great way to save money which is what i have	1
this page	1
i dont care that it is a tablet it is so much more than a tablet	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0

the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more sorry	0

i ve had no problems at all with it and i m glad	1

i am amazed and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can hardly put up with the cameras noise because i have never seen anything like it before	1
however its the optical zoom that is best for of the shots that i took	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
and man i had to go back to check my info on the player because i had the wrong chinese names of the players	0
it has all the features you need in one place	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players out there that can play just about anything you throw at it	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
i have a built in wall rated gauge speaker wire and the stands fit this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the stand	1
i was able to use the phone for over two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
it would just go up and down and display no disc	0
while in the memory the keyboard connector is connected	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i do not know what other people are doing but the software is not working	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
i have had it for less than a month and it quite well never had a problem with it and the jack is all screwed up	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0

the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
i recommend it to everyone but it is not worth putting on weight so sad i know	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
not what i was hoping for but it is nothing special	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
some features in the user interface	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1

simply the canon g is the best out there today	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
upon looking at these i find them to be very small but having value to them	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1

but with a low price comes lower quality	0
i did not want to make a nomad explorer out of	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
it came well packaged	1
price gb of storage	1
they are clears and ready to be loaded into the ship along with a sub	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
the quality is very good all the songs even with my usb connection is very nice and clear	1
b fast and easy to use ripping takes about seconds for a single file on my pentium pc with x drive	1
it is slightly more expensive than the original and packed with even more features	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
their network coverage is very poor and they always seem to be overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
while i am using it instead of i am calling it a because it has worked well for me during the time i have used it	1
there are	1
i will have to check with others here about the quality of the food	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
i got it for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
it does look pretty spending money but you want something that has the asthetics bit down pat	0
do nt buy this player	0
seems reasonable	1
this fantastic little computer does exactly what i had hoped for work study travel	1
if life is good for you i recommend buying a camera or two for those emergency pics you have to have	0
cheap and they should have made it out of hard plastic and put it on the wall	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of and are very much looking for a computer speaker rrb this is it	0
the fight against the poor design continues with the case	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
n t be easy but there is nt really anything you can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	1
it is crystal clear	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
the storage capacity is great	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
here is a link if you are interested and want to add your old phone book to this phone book it is free help me out of re entering my numbers	1

i have had this thing just over a month and it has already been used	0
i was dissapointed that it was nt done	0
it is beautiful the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the screen is bright and it is covered in it chrome finish	1
small size	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is that it is obtainable with these point and shoot digicams as well	1
i bought this coolpix with a mb ultra flash card as expected i have found that qualities of this model are very similar with the pixel fine tuning and many of the user friendly functions are very same to slr models and with	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the product on sale	0
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
this product is amazing	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
the case is very interesting and interesting but unfortunately lacks a conclusion	0
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
the device itself is not	0
the controls are a bit inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
kudos apple though we are of the opinion that your support is key to that	1
so now it all plays out you just can t see it	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
how the device has worked for me for the past year	1
i used to be very frustrated with some of the sound but now that i have a laptop and i have to open up my sound card so i can switch between music and movies or tv the sound is much more acceptable	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
without any doubt at all if the game is accurate the characters are as realistic as i have ever seen produced by them and this is a great game	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the service from the airport is very good too	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
but what you should really look at here is the fact that the game does have a lot of potential	1
the sound is loud and s l o w and it is loud even with the volume turned all the way down but it is all right because these are my friends	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1

the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
if it turns out to be the disposable type	0
i only have one complaint and that is the fact that the	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
this is amazing	1
it is light enough to carry around with you	1
my first experience with it was very poor	0
there is no roof so it sits very low to the ground	0
it is or is not it is fantastic and it is nice to carry this around instead of stacks of books	1
very bad quality	0
all i can say is that this is a good thing	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
same story as everyone else when trying to make money from nothing	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
david i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i want from my is voice mails all else is good	0
the setup system for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is terrible	0
transfering is easy and the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
i m delighted with this product	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
the screen is large enough and the resolution is sharp enough that you ll never have to worry about workspace issues	1
i immediately had to turn on the player to watch two of my favorite dvds	0
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
it is well made and well worth the price	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
it played only the first dvd is without problems the other two being affected by a lot of glitches	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
i m so glad i bought this camera	1
when you turn on your computer the player turns on really fast and it continues to play as long as you turn it when you want	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
this camera is closer to perfect than any other digicam that is out there	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
the past year has not been a good year for me at all	1
after cleaning it up i found that it was only half of what i put in it	0
if you re looking for a challenge this is it	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
the phone is as good as a cell phone thank god	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the camera g gives a lot of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for beginners to use	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
also the design of the design is flawed	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
i love the quality of it	1
for a specific location i cant give you but its a great phone	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and is very loud	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
poor grip on the keys	0
it surpasses the performance in a mp camera	1
the only problem i have is the screen on my pc is stiff	0
usb transfer data	0
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
you are going to need to buy new headphones because these suck	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the lrb is all i had to do with it there are no distractions and i do nt have to strain my eyes and ears when i am trying to focus on the screen	1
does not have enough power when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the camera was hidden away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in poor quality the camera was on standby	0
also it was very easy to set up a route to get there as it was as easy as	1
it sounds good out here or on my coffee stand	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
