convenience because it works through the usb port	1
convenience because through works it the usb port	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
great buy another i d phone	1
you can much program even any with the pc how i do e you graphics from more picture on your computer and if your know suite to so jme you can free ringtones from midi files make free own apps games	1

it also a lot the ipod less than costs	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1

the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
i picture using enlarging pictures to x easily no visable loss in best quality and not setting with the m possible as even yet	1
so with was useless and ugly yes all software bundled with creative products it as	0
range was using linksys router old had than the possibly to or i slightly worse been comparable for years	0

i loved for it it broke period less than a month is acceptible an until but of time not something to work	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
bad very quality	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
it does nt open the drive smell when you like burning plastic	1
the system is looking better than the ipods in size and design terrific imo	1

the buttons on the phone my small fingertips small even quickly for but are get used to them rather you	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0

the overly scroll is button sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0

for tinker of us think like to creative i that those offers some advantages	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
my new nomad love i its great	1
software is another great misfortune hard does operate frequently crashes to my music library s up nt work mp with screwed the list goes on and on	0
