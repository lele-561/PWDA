what worries me is the fact that it does not work	0

its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0

the power button is somewhat small and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that you have to press to turn on the camera	0

compared to everything else in this category this is most definitely the best bang for the buck	1
i have been to the g and it has proven itself to be all that it is supposed to be	1
its cheaper and you get more memory for much less than an ipod	1

it works only during installation of the system	0
the software is free and within minutes of opening my box i was able to connect to any one of my devices	1
i hope that limited lifetime warranty means it will take a while to run out on the warranty	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
this router does work every once in a while but not like it did every hour or so	0

i have over songs in my playlist at the moment and the album does a great job of summing it up	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1

the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
i sent my monitor in to be repaired for repairs for such a long time of constant buzzing from my gd hz monitor	0
it s exceptional but i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i selected the best ones and have gotten the best pictures every time	1
i thought the e s and f s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
the speakerphone the radio all features are available	1
however its not the best setting is it for of the shots that i take	0
while my laptop and netbook have speakers the sound quality on such devices is much worse than with standard speakers and it is hard to hear some audio	0
due to the lack of support for the upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the last one i was very unimpressed	0

this device is too fragile for normal use	0
i think the canon g is the best digital camera out there right now at this price point	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
your site has a nice guest post section so your visitors can see it separate of your primary link	1

i am and i am nt connected to the internet	0

the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
after a while the quality of the disks was finally recognized but it was slow and features not available	0
the quality of firmware itself is a big deal and suggests that this company is just getting started	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
the pc sync feature is a feature that comes with nokia pc sync	0
it also has a stock tracking system and a somewhat useful calculator which converts all types of currencies	0
but what you should really look at here is the fact that the game does have a lot of potential	1

not what i hoped for but it is nothing new	1

i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
i think i think the satellites look ugly	0
seemed like a good deal but it frequently can not be done takes a long time to do and then concludes no good	0

transfer through windows explorer to a folder for the nomad as an additional hard disk so it will allow you to easily drag and drop files from windows explorer into a folder	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
they said the problem was the wrong product in the box the next day the tech industry started to believe what the experts said was wrong	0

the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
this is by far the best in so many ways	1
the sound is very good with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1

the remote is hard to get used to feeling and awkward to use	0
good luck life	1
i am sure it would and can be done in a different setting than where you are but only if you want to be at a whisper	1

when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
easy to set up	1
so if you re looking for a good day you may be very disappointed with this day forecaster	0
they caused the problem because the product was defective and the company tech failed to believe what the manufacturer said was wrong	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0

simple back buttons back buttons front buttons and display are very easy to read and use	1
i tried it in fact it works great so i will change to this one as soon as possible it work great for my needs and it worked very fast and with the extra ram nothing could be done	1
reviews for sound quality are generally very positive	1
when it was first released its great but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
i wished that they would have played the volumn a little bit louder	0
this however is a completely different story and has made most of my songs sound worse than they are enjoy it	0
as it stands right now the game is free if you are packing the player up for travel or if you load up the game beforehand	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
while i had the phone the main features were good sound quality and an fm fm radio and internet connection	1
even the performance is quite impressive from such rather small numbers	1
