in outdoor settings indistinguishable from mm	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
great colors pictures white	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
after several years of torture in the hands at t customer service am delighted to drop them and look forward august i will convert other family from at t to t mobile	0

its far heavier and which not seem to matter if you use it running or keep it in your	0
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
i the bass this thing i my car should tell you enough i am the bass is great	1
the sound quality is very good	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
have this monitor for a month and i m very pleased with it	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
it has which is average these cameras	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
seems to work everything else	1
the woofer is much larger	1
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
the software is not real intuitive	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere g does sync of third party flashes just as does dedicated flashes	1
this small size pumps great sounds with sansas and ipods	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
very easy to use in fact on a recent trip i was take picture a vacationing elderly group	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
i very pleased	1
great features	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
the full with a fair bass even for such a small	1
the customer support is	1
the router gets better better	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the monitors were both good	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i tried to the song three with no success	0
transfering easy the software	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
this system is very powerful	1
surprisingly work well	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
the service from the supplier was	0
means fast data transfers	1
of course i hesitant given the price ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and a second as a christmas present for	1
i think reason made is that it uses gpu acceleration	1
this router does a while but not like did every hour	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i it works great great sound understand that the volume for iphone are different things that should placed at the right measures to the better sound quality i do nt complain for of i recommend this tower	1
has a different type battery charging system from the battery needs to be charged while in the camera the charging system you use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i selected the right and have gotten pictures every time	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
i have tried several times to contact apex through their on line support site and their telephone line but wo answer my emails telephone is always busy	0
what to buy was the that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
its ability to as a back up is a huge plus	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but nt enjoy to navigate	0
key instead	0
the buttons the phone even for my small fingertips you used to them rather quickly	0
it plays i ve so far even an old vcd that ripped and the rental dvd that nt be played my old sharp	1
a week out the box and began to contractions of time	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
video output stopped workin	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and company is just to put out fires	0
is good enough to integrate my cx to my toyota camry mode	1
set up with problems	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
for the cost	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox xtra and it	0
agree the earlier reviewer a viewing order to get consistent contrast	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
the software the router is pretty good	1
player has with dual layer dvd is such as season and season	0
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
i only have one complaint and is included	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
is closest to perfect than any other digicam megapixel	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
good power no	1
is very light and slim fits nicely into my tv stand	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
the the radio which utterly useless	0
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the second set is working just fine	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
the is compact package and find nikon to be can trust	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
runs through of the stand giving a very clean look	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
very long lasting battery life	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
overall it is the best camera on	1
i fell in love with this camera it ease of use an of	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
hooked worked like a charm great picture bright colors and weight	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
it has very good range much better the linksys router replaced	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i was to that this dvd play mpeg allowed to stack movies on a dvd also was play vob files which i created with smart ripper	0
b takes about seconds a cd on pentium pc with x drive	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
if you want to title you already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the picture quality and features which are too mention are unmatched any	1
the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good you have everything	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
very good value for the money	1
overall i like the unit	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
had more sturdy casing	0
i had time to this player audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be creative labs	1
chance with new product and pleased except six months it will cost half of what i paid but is the price for current state of the art	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
unlike some the other people who received a lemon my dvd player in perfect working	1
this little camera has a myself and nikon never knew i love digital	1
i the of entertaining games on this phone	1
thuumbs to widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
are inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
the image quality is excellent	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the in program id tag editing is as well	1
screen good read	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware doing what it primarily meant to do to a wireless telephone	1
i m delighted with this product	1
the manual does any blanks	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
sound quality is good	1
this camera keeps autofocussing in mode a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way the next months as other pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
and the body construction general has of plastic after	0
i have my ad back to apex because wo nt play disney other movies	0
as all software bundled with creative it was useless and ugly	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
by cocking the shutter to halfway position getting settings ready shoot i produce stopaction photos	0
nt buy	1
it did play a dvd which my older philips machine	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
great phone d buy another	1
does player at random despite and player is library	0
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
on dvds so refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the on	0
door broke after a month	0
i it only produced sound a cd played with a dvd i only got no picture	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
the as a cell phone thank god	1
the sound level not as i would have expected	0
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
of course have some good customization options the well	1
extremely small and convenient will and not	1
d extreme n wireless fine	1
the changing colors help to with a quick glance	1
the problems came from my video card	0
sucks	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
the apex machines have good features	1
and it does not show the picture matter what i do	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
there in powerful camera	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
as a whole dvd player has a sleek design and works	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
player and looks great you can get the dvd is to play	1
now i have all my on it there has nt been any more problems	1
naturally i quite a bit purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
i personally would this router in hold or small buisiness	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
is a great camera for you	1
the appearance is okayed	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
portable	1
the screen be a little smaller but it is very readable and nt come in the overused blue	0
i d tell my experiences but waiting back i never got far enough to try this	0
the is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to in its cage	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
looks fantastic	1
for and good life and this product	1
sub woofer is	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to just log on to canon is website	1
however since i am i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and volumes sound a little weak	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
it is	1
does nt like burning plastic when you open	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery size nice screen firmware updates great	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i less than a month is of time for to work	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
the remote is and awkward to use	0
it excellent coverage through our two story	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
for me perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
the display it be in a myriad of positions to protect it any damage	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
i still think it is the digital camera available under	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
bought this monitor from computer direct i have been very satisfied so far	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
player was working it was great	0
bottom line camera easy to use flexible and powerful features the ability external flash and choices	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
is one has made	1
the speakerphone works than speakerphone ve ever had	1
can this phone to anyone anytime	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the size is small	1
great value gb vs for the price	1
we got phones for the t mobile family plan came with a broken headphone and died today after weeks of use	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
these great bike the weekend in the park	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
has a lots of features easy use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
storage even at kbs you can a ton of songs this thing	1
for instance several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and it plays the dvds	1
it holds much music and audio files	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
the software which player is	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it is a learning curve for it just right users say they success rate find it they just device	1
super easy	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
when went to again was sound but no picture	0
lastly i feel that over priced for i there is some inherent benefit the bose label that i do nt of rrb	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
hopless product hopeless company hopeless customer support	0
the controls on the side of which i like because my thumb when i hold the thing	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
images taken were nt so clear	0
great quality picture and features	1
the poor design continues with the case	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when a variety genres as will adjust equalizer which be a big hassle	1
the player does not work properly	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
great great investment	1
is a plus are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
the software is not good and driver has working with other sound blaster which is very dumb	0
for it worked almost perfectly	1
delivery was prompt	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the battery life seems takes to charge it mp quickly and there is no delay	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
also navigating music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
it allows the usb interface on the to used for or print	1
oops go online adjust it	0
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the terrible	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
is a little hard to understand	0
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
very easy set up	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
lost internet connection was when connected to the modem rrb	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the price performance looked just right	1
it is worth it	1
do know other people the software is	0
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
it came well packaged	1
it is easy	1
although sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player result	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
well within days quit	0
great colors pictures and white balance	1
i am ripping my cd collection wma this an average of around mb cd for about cds in mb of free memory to me	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
other than that is so crisp and clear and i would purchase this all over again	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
another great misfortune crashes frequently screwed my music library up does work the list goes on and on	0
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
is with serious user interface flaws	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
ve it for about weeks it is i ve seen and used ever	1
keys out so no	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the router was and has worked well the last couple months i have had it	1
i this player	1
again the were spot on and projected from they should the of the tv	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
the only thing i is the quality longevity on the thing	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
all features work perfectly	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
very compact and portable described with great sound quality	1
i this easily different android phones	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
is by far the finest camera its price and category i	1
have not even used my new dvd player and already i	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
i a ton of research settled on this phone because the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access my corporate email	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
still i willing to those things as this looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
it has a few inconveniences is that do automatically play like on a cd	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
for some reason looks out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
this awesom it will only support and you can never more than a open nat type are usualy moderate or strict when i were very nice tried to get it working right but to bottom line you just laptop and you will this router is	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having you ll be you had fm radio	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the feature to put in the song information nt always	0
p s the remote control does to times and doesnt respond but it may be just error	0
not be inclined to purchase again	0
exasperated i called it quits and will sending awful deceptive back	0
i the automatic key lock function	0
the service is very good too	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
it would have much nicer if it a window so could see the if did nt cover up the ac jack	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
the larger lens the g picture in low light and optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
at first i dealt with this	1
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i was looking it even if said it was slow	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
fm receiver it has none	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
is great to switch to spot metering and actually working on the lcd screen	1
first of all my calls and clear unlike with sprint	1
the sound pretty good lrb not anything like a surround system there is but really it when display is in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
reading of the it is still to figure	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
disappointment	0
have used it frequently and have	1
i yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures i am very pleased	1
was flawless with the instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt nobody mention this	1
many our disney movies play on this dvd player	1
sound this slim design puts out	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
i have been ripping it for the past few weeks of use is	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1

i love this player and would probably go with creative labs	1

plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
will some in it you can t avoid that	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the g looks like a work	1
update the finish more mirror than silver i	1
are surprisingly quick through usb	1
no it why it	0
the device small	0

i love my new nomad its great	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
loved the slim design	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
is awesome but if u too loud depends the sound crack	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
enough to remove and there the battery could be inserted	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the phone is small light very attractive	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i tried to get a hold of apex telephone number is constantly busy the one customer service rep	0
at the very least a sturdier carrying	1
i also liked the fact that you save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
however i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
what junk	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable dvd with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
all in all this is a very good for who has small portable computer and wants lapdesk	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
this router is phenomenal	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
some movies it played yesterday it play today	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
i would strongly this product	1
can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
we are pleased with the monitor and the company	1
i highly recommend this camera anyone a good digital camera takes yet nt take weeks figure out	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
my overall experience with this monitor	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i apex number numerous times it just	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized was poor and not available	0
the camera has wonderful set of features	1
can t go wrong with this price	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
for this is a good dvd player	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
i wished that they make volumn a little bit louder	0
the only things i that havent liked that the is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
the grain was terrible	0
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
the storage capacity is great for me	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
the sound quality good	1
over the price this is a good unit	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
without a doubt i say that these speakers the same sound quality as the jbl on stage are truly portable lrb played without i love	1
was wonderful about picking it the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
day when i was listening to a song and will not do anything now	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
it will only side to side lrb no down or tilt feature rrb	0
home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined and respectable	1
this phone is with a huge array features	1
you the be heard or so that does nt make	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
after loading songs all now player not connected or busy	0
it is small	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
silver magnesium finish and the sharp lines and excellent grip i ve seen	1
good life	1
focusing display rack about feet in a brightly lit room during day time pictures were blurry	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
have yet to try using all of adjustment options priority aperature light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
i have ice age keeps me no	0
it is made of plastic	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
and so far have not dvds not	0
is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
the plays is has occasional problems such as not recognizing dvd stopping a particular point every time we being able to access certain special on a dvd	0
sound polyphonic are very nice it also as a which a nice feature when you are bored	1
this is by far so many ways	0
huge storage capacity for the price can modify on the fly has a	1
is for the price and have tons of good bass	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
i purchased this phone for just and there is end to what i do with it	1
having considerable time with professional gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
also it was with free shipping tax so overall it is a decent player	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem the first place	0
range is great upstairs downstairs outside or basement four bars all the time	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
i can rate one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
polite help just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
of it is hidden features i keep this to non american region dvd is	0
small size	1
is which does not along several long stretches on that same route	1
is excellent	1
i stored around cd is on this and have available memory	1
there occasionally lip sync issue	0
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
my dad has an apex tv and it was for	1
unfortunately player would not any of my region one dvds even though not damaged in any way	0
the netbook as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine with ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will to as soon as possible	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
tried called apex cust service help	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
the is and the sound is good	1
the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
it works great	1
i the controls and learned manuver through the menus quickly	0
and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about quality of their products and to stand behind them	0
one beef is the scroll nt as well as d like	0
the sound quality been since day one the base constantly drops calls now there be short circuit in the base can no longer use the ac adapter or it	0
for the price is	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
slow gui be to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and yes minutes	0
while i phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and	1
so far the router has worked well	1
the memory is staggering	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
connect to your computer open up mediasource and you listen to your mp s as they	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
are beautiful	1
it is an gizmo	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
i recently purchased am satisfied	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
i on the phone their support you connected and do nt have to wait rrb and got my imac and macbook back online	1
is the most bang the buck out there	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
ability to connect to the router a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
but of dvd is i ithave when the picture will freeze but the dvd and eventualy the picture kicks in after skipping moments	0
great speakers overall	1
overall the g delivers must be considered the best image quality of current megapixel from a tonal balance color response point of view	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
as a portable player it should feel	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
good battery life	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
took me a few tries get is very user player imo	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
pros cost win home premium hdmi port lrb could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv its delivering great	1
it a nice color screen	1
ve used the the battery did not go one single bar	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
price along with the replaceable battery were on why i picked the nomad	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate as realistic as ve ever seen produced by film and this is a image	1
will read and play all cd audio disc	1
m still frustrated with some of the properties but that i have and know have to open my sound is control panel every time i switch music videos games is much more acceptable	0
freezes and yells dad somethings wrong	0
this phone	0
this camera has canon is great plus you see the lcd is what you get	1
no matter the format	1
lots of but exceptional sound quality size and price make it a good buy	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
of and player makes this player the best	1
when you turn on your player player really fast and the music continues play you it when you were turning it off	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
overall i like it	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what stupid size it is adapter	0
the fm radio is cool	1
i	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
we we but we never in touch with the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
however you get what pay for in reliable products	1
awesome sound system	1
neither message was	0
the macro mode is exceptional the very clear and you can take with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
another point of note life is	1
unit great video output failed	0

with this player get memory much less an ipod	1
easy use has mentioned about this	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
the function lever one which switches between capture and view mode	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
quality of the pictures	1
nice machines but consider their quality now	1
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
camera and for the price you can t beat it	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1

not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0

i use a home theater system it is amazing how it sounds is	1
the battery life is amazing	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
key instead	0
this has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
while the the keyboard connector	0
g had problems focusing in low light and not take when the was after the shutter had few seconds	0
inside can be a bit challenging but when instantly delete pics you do nt like that are perfectly lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom releases the player cover has not been an issue for and is immaterial if you use the case as the case the switch	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
without having to go through the isp and taking all the extra steps	1
feel is like it it definately survive a drop	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
this is the best phone i have seen	1
this a deal for music data storage	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
i by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours it died	0
great	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to for the price	1
and it works great too	1
with my sennheiser headphones is loud enough	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
the makes things easy to see and writing big for people to see	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the mode works for the remainder of shots are not going be in a regular setting	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
both are easy to learn use and intuitive for even a novice	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility my nd generation ipod nano	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
usually avoid horns i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
the songs even with my usb connection still very quick and the quality is very good	1

if you are picky about image quality go it	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
creative mediasource not as sleek looking as mediaplayer is effective and is linked	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
in the user interface	0

you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has on screen focus that be really helpful a scene is tough to automatically focus	1

i wanted the product to work soo bad but it did nt	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
paid more than what amazon is currently at price depression due poor quality no doubt rrb and expected a good quality product these random disconnects	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that ve seen	1
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
i quite having gigs of music as well as a gigs of media files in the data folder	0
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1

this phone won me over a big seller was size it fits nicely into any	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
loading cds was i think it would with the ipod as well	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1

the mms technology is very well integrated this which you	1
if you ve mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this product is amazing	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0

the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
signal strength all over my three story house unit is located top floor rrb very user friendly in	1

is tall so i ended up	0
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
a relatively low price	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0

p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
everything was great until dropping sporadically	1
it run should be given lots of room air circulation	0

the of this little critter	0
the fact i can carry in or pocket and	1
small size	1

finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera easy to use you get used to it	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0

the apex has been a steady me	1
is clear if your not on	1
really is a phone nice features and its tiny	1
there which has been in other reviews about of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without right out of	0
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the second set is working	1
has nt been a hassle at all	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
and really this is the best phone one	1
heres stuff you should with the things screen is really big the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell music transfer controls mastering great sound and i ve heard different equilizer type deals on here	1
plusses the easy to remove battery and the terrific produced by the nomad	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
this router is the best i have used date	1
nt wrong with these if what you looking for a good sound in a small package	1
the up is goof proof offers a superior result	1

a college apartment the e and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill	1
got this thing for christmas i have been very happy with it	1
started accessing and to it to extremely	1

i who uses web browsing so this phone met and	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
the reason i rated it a is of that darn diopter adjustment its small hard so t	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes even great love this phone	1

creating playlists using the included software was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz you them on with the sound turned up	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
about of the time can t find the device when i attach to my pc	0
it is enough to around all day without bother	1
very bad quality	0
it is very light weight has a good signal strength	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
only con i can think of is no camera	0

as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust though notmad may still work better	1
i should ve trusted about the terrible repair team of acer	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
router has obviously with static ip addresses firewalls	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1

is a cd burner	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
all drives attached to this wireless router to be in the networked local computer desktop and be able to and drop attach etc	1
excellent except maybe a tad at times when there are quieter talkers the end	1
the phone book is very user friendly and is	1
it would spin read some more and then on the display that there was no disc	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
also i can t understand why the software ignore the when it lists the cds in	0
a low price comes lower quality	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
am and at the i am getting from this g can easily up with the cameras limitations because ve anything better within its limits	0
i set it up and would not connect	0
i using musicmatch software already on my computer to load onto	1
like other reviewers installation	1
creative are the sound people for computers understand would introduce static	0
the menu options are uncreative as t a screen items you have to scroll up and down to find what re for	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
even better the optional headset you to music over the integrated radio	0
i do nt matters though i mean hooked to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture awesome	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
fragile	0
overall	1
tried contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
has treat their customers like rubbish and a miserable repair facility match products	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly	0
the interface used	1
not only is more a better player for windows is what i	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
setup from in the box to completely working programmed for preset fm stations under minutes	1
fixed cable do this	0
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
it a snap to set and my ps eee and pcs	1
the speakers are nice no question about is good for the size the range what you might expect speakers size perhaps even better than	1
the only is speaker wire is	0
does not have an light which is nice shots it allows the camera to in low light	0
camera	1
picture quality is excellent	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is than other cheaper apex units	0
when i with of light and the objects were nt moving the were awesome	1
the sound well there no complaints	1
material is on the cheap side	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
this is recommended otherwise	1
the final insult is while this comes with to printers a snap it is only trial version have to download the trial software from the internet additional to some unknown company unlock all the features	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
starts skipping the dvd are dirty	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
nice compact	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
it i can listen to music anytime	1
even bass is pretty impressive	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
i gave the stars because it is excellent for that it and it is really appropriate to rate it on players in a different class	1
the come hazy if your hands shake even the entire process of taking a picture	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
considering the price and specs might be best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
the woofer is much	1
very simple use	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has itself be all that is advertised	1
a few my work constituants the g and the canon for	1
because this camera beautiful	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices achievement a hard drive based player	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not and blend into the rest of my furniture	1
is compared to ipod is	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies all the company is products	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
bottom line unbeatable price	1
can stop this is the best n router will find today lrb i am writing on rrb	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
amazon com it for such a great price how can you wrong	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
comes wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
that this model would was a plus for me as a visual artist discovered by accident will play mpeg files a regular r disk without vcd formatting	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
this camera was very to learn and produces spectacular images	1
speed tests showed were comparable those of my home wireless router	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
the backlight the phone goes off too quickly and there no way to change this	0

having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting a little dull tend take photographs from a distance	0
ever from the image quality color	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
bright vivid clean lines wide great	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
range speed	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
both the white speakers are	0

the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
overall i like the unit	1
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant the indoor shots are very provided that your subject is more about feet away	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
is if all over the world packed features	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
another nice thing that has both optical coax digital audio though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before	1
overall a sweet machine	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
monitor was to set up works promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	0
the moveable lcd screen is	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
the door would not	0
just the right size for my desk	1
with it enabled anytime we had to press the front of the router because the gui one would nt	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
finally making playlists from the computer can complicated because the tracks organized by cd which in alphabetical order	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1

oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
hands free speakerphone quite powerful	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
there neither picture nor sound	0
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
they look fantastic	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1

you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
great picture	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
these speakers are great	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0

and i love extremely low loud bass as such i suplemented the system with a jbl sub	0
purchased of at very good rates from amazon we pleased	1
the lcd screen very large and readable	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
otherwise a monitor for its price	0
it has failed to deliver on quality	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
eax are as creative has included of that for the extraneous noise encountered in or on a train	0
good looks	1
the speakers a very rich sound and good bass obviously not for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1

i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
awesome sound system	1
dvd play is basicly junk	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
i dissapointed that acer nt more	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
so have no complaints this to anyone who wants quality over anyone who wants a harddrive based player wants pay next to nothing	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
is wonderful easy use high quality and compact in size	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
came back working was momentarily glad the rumors i about did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
i found it useful transferring files to another computer	1
the is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the larger screen allowed me to all my photos on it lrb could nt the dell rrb and	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
i the belkin fm transmitter unit with it worked well it top of awful trying to in the car which is somewhat of disappointment	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
if you a quality product delivered on	1
no way to contact their customer	0
it all the features	1
is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
ordered this computer she is a teacher she a small computer that would keep her from bringing work with her	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
ooh and i it still this little camera has i have nt gotten of them yet	0
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
it came well packaged	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
the screen is easy to read and is naturally cool	1
recommend getting superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the pictures razor in	1
the is great	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
replacement unit had a problem the little switch on nt working properly making it impossible select among city	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
this is great	1
decent but would estimate get maybe the quality that would from line out	0
delivery was prompt	1
excellent range	1
at it not ipod	1
in addition comes with sleek and powerful headset	1
the had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
that is a rare feature	1
great phone	1
creative software is awkward difficult to use plain nt load on	0
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most looking player and nt support a folder stucture	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
seems to read most dvds fine and	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
speakerphone	1
price gb	1
software the software is crap	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
mid range it is there and to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the pictures their is a learning curve to it there are of features i have nt even gotten to	1
pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts on one single charge the software is very user friendly and is in it chrome casing	0
is to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
anything this phone does does perfectly	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
is the best phone i have seen	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
the minor i have with are the lens cap the lens itself	0
had no problems up the and getting favorite cd	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
t mobile really teamed up	1
after years with that expensive horrible customer service portability	0
due to lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork just the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the monitor works with and bright display	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
only con i camera	0
simply this was created left behind	0
was surprised how the sound was and i especially like to use when i listening to audio books	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
having usb for transfers	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
which the glitches if there are any	1
this that there is a good chance that this phone easily like typical american phones	0
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
is also very flexible	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
the setup process the nomad is infuriating the interface with the player is sub par	0
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
think this is it is biggest flaw	0
i been bothered blown out highlights on the s and the g to do only slightly better	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
they deliver hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
the on off an button needs to turn the camera	0
sound quality is wonderful i really like the sound normalization	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
the software sucks	0
however some of the bandwidth hogging software bog down to the point where was having to reset it computer too often in order to a dropped internet connection	0
i gave it only stars due to the that the st one broke dropped it from a short	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive modem as i returned the item got a linksys modem instead	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
top that covered the kept poping off without much of near the bottom latch	0
great phone i d buy another	1
the price the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy rrb	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
of through t mobile is services they have deleted the options would enable you to configure the phone to used a different network	0
i it to is graduation party in longer lengths worked expected even out	1
the explorer program shut a couple times while was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just	0
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
overall the nikon is very robust and useful	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
however once crank the a little to a level bit too distracting the work i like to done with some background music audio is well is relative great a speaker rrb	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
i enthusiastically	1
i did not managed to creative nomad to work	0
but a great deal mp player get the nomad	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
after nearly pictures i have that nikon	0
too difficult change	0
first you sync to more than one computer	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
easy enough but it work	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
does not provide enough volume when to	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
storage	1
no jack	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
the that come are nt that bad	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
zoom up down in magnification which is nice but is a display the of the way down the top of the screen interferes with viewing at most settings	0
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
the price is very good	1
the picturers are amazing	1
great for medical photographs the auto mode terrific for point and shoot	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
fragile	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
overall an excellent phone	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
very simple to use	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install cisco valet wireless hotspot	1
was a little in the low end	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
after and hearing of i tour pop speaker i	1
the sound is the battery life is excellent the that the battery is replacable is excellent finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
neither message was answered	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
fanatics	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest is nt fast it with the hotkey shortcut	0
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
was nowhere near stable and in alpha stage	1
possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful mode which optimized situational settings like snow sunset etc are endless	1
maybe it is of i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the screen too easily scratched	0
i am my phone a lot	0
unfortunately i bought because the ps could nt all and now the player everything	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the main reason i am is the will lock at odd times	0
even better you do have to worry	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
i work with the more love	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
is sleek and the screen has	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
the size a little bit than ipod it a little bit	0
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
its fast and rewind work much more and consistently than of models i ve had	1
the controls on are very simple no need for a manual	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0

you blame the bad chat support or the technicians for because i all the information i could	0
the first night got i put it next to me when went to bed just to to and the handset nt anything its too light so with it	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
ve viewed since a college student poor of picture quality ve seen	0
main dial is not backlit	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
this product is amazing	1
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
the other controls very easy to use	1
was in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
do nt buy this player	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
the appear at a time the whole screen and one to scroll down by one or have memorized where they are select using the number keypad	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
they stay and deliver a decent audio quality	1
try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
to my amazement even that was error prone	0
no firewire to the camera	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp the	1
sure is a little than the ipod but by much	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the plans also very good at for me	1
nt it i but just sort of fizzled out	0
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
the only nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
did also seem to have a smell for some time	0
long life	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the sound quality is really good	1
lets review the songs before begins its transfer	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
blu ray player live box normally lean back smile and light a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than u	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
is easy to pop it open to what song you re listening to	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
i ve e mails to their customer service department requesting with no response	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
useless is since it display window	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn of the it means to turn off turn it on which not to my likings	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
asking for specifically for christmas many different mp players but finally decided this one that i could nt be happier and i is	0
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
it works great	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
can on the fly without aid of a computer you can use play modes for your or playlists	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
i immediately problems getting the player two of my favorite dvds	0
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
simply the best digital camera out there today at	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
my first and it	1
pros so off went to get a faster this one did the it	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
features	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services pc compatibility	1
it looks really stylish and everything it claims	1

i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
the aff feature did the letterbox to of screen the image still looked normal	0
it wo take pics with which is	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
the storage capacity is great	1
price	1
most will and logitech is products no this rule however since somewhat in fact a great deal sturdy than my old radio	1
with i have on the player room for	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
speakerphone	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
the nicest electronic devices that ve ever owned	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
getting good value in this product	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
i am is quality customer service that i would recommend netgear to	1
last night i	1
nice little phone light compact	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the interface atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at	1
nothing but	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
have windows xp pro and installing the enclosed software i did message there a problem installing the driver	0
the option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control simplest easiest controls have seen or used	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
the system is size and better the ipods	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
setup very easy	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
sure it had the but when tried to it just up to task	0
oh and the pretty sweet	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
to my ears just as good as the xtra sounds just as good	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
is easy i found that from the player was easy too	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
despite minor disappointment i recommend the canon anyone who serious about digital photography	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
the memory is staggering	1
been disappointed to find that there no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon is what lmost exactly	0
one issue that is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
but this camera is great	1
also very light and portable	1
i love this monitor	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
now when fails i have to and it	0
words the is not storage only buy the capacity you	0
the infrared is a blessing you have a previous nokia want transfer your old phone to this phone saved me hours of re my	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
i did nt think would find this quality ease use thrilled my purchase	1
the dvd player is fine	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0

usb transfer	0
this happened with several different dvd is and if work when it did work one time before	0
bigger than expected but that ok because i is something work with my iphone	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
multiple modes tracks order of album shuffle etc standard but noting the zen xtra not in matter	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
amazon amazing return policy i return no loss on my part	1
the only that found with the internet service is that does very at all	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
expected the x zoom to be grainy high the zoomed images	0
i m delighted with this product	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
the included earpiece very comfortable and easy use	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
their network and the network resulting very unpleasant calling experience	0
there was neither picture nor sound	0
well backlit keypad	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the door would not close	0
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
this camera worth every penny and i recommend it	1
for not	0
headphone seems to a	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
i love that is is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
this thing i like use it pick tough on my also to listen to my old	0
i used this monitor for years now it shows a mixture of various colors de focused text	0
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
the canon software does you a raw image at all the raw image it been by the image affecting settings in the camera	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
i experimented with online two major us and retailers and delivered great results	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
finally i reiterate thumbs down rating for t mobile	0
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
would nt buy because of the customer service	0
a fun little nt expect	0

i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
for all	1
mixed i guess but the price	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1

bought slick phone and am with it	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
model now failed me twice in the short span	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the focus performs well love having the optional scene they to many situations in which i would actually seek use the camera	1
headphones suck would invest in some cool ones it has the eax feature	0
into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had the standard features and this seemed to be	0
complaint like others it disconnects from the bluetooth annoying when it does it does it so often	0
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
does what it should and the sound seems to me	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
other things that i miss are voice activated and	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
love	1
the build quality is top notch	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
recieved this product works outstanding good battery life which what the house uses to my network easisly	1
it really impressed with the disign the specs the price	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
range of functions as indicated above has something everyone power advanced functions those who are	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
they have a whole bunch of that have	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
there is an alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
the battery charged for a long time and no more than or hours at most to fully recharge ac	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
apex ad runs including dvd r rw and	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
one bad thing is that it comes and most purposes it	0
overall an excellent phone	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
the size is small	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
unfortunately can t	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
poor on the keys	0
but to that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
hooking the i that it would only played less than of the dvds put in it	0
this is wonderful to for your first dvd player	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
access to so much music ever is terrific	1
may have luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
the player mechanics are also flawed	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
this is extemely lame	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
the sound this slim design puts out	1
great quality picture features	1
the software failed	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
best tech support i have experienced	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
while going for a cellphone determined to buy only as is	0
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
was the wait because ag neovo is has all this and more	0
is nice	1
greater clarity with the ihome	1
you to need buy new headphones the suck	0
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the screen is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
it for this by being extremely easy to with well laid out controls be learned quickly	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
the ad did work corectly from the start and the ad lasted a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
i am very with it so far	1
the replacable battery is since once eventually wears out you will be able another easily	0
this is great piece speaker system for a computer is	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
possibly biggest advantage this has is the fact the can replace the battery him by the and popping in the new battery	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
this a nice feature i e it is you rather listen to easy rather than heavy metal no problem	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
the battery is nice	1
i used this monitor for few and had no problems	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
excellent picture quality on par my pioneer players	1
the software quick easy to use i the entire process very easily mastered	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
connection to the is so easy	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
nt go here the online sites go into i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
no fm or voice recording these would have nice	0
works then it does not and you left standing there you are doing something wrong	0
playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
size the ipod	0
size bigger than the ipod	0
but definately recommend this phone	1
great phone	1
recently bought this coolpix along mb flash card as expected i happily that of the picture m combos and of user friendly functions very to with convenience of a digital camera that you	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
office starter web cam is also and elegant cons i wo nt anything bad as are just paying for this net book	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
so easy set had some problems with my archos	1
this router is phenomenal	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
we got this time and was new perfect condition performance can be expected for the machine keep i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
it and ones	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
the quality very good	1
eax on you can modify your sound which is pretty good can get different variations with it	1
screen brightness is really good	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
the sound that came that little record player sounded like carnegie	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
what a disappointment	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
the only complaint i have that push in the scroll wheel select have to or sticks	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
easy to hook up	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
things much more distinct and i do nt have strain my eyes and squint when i trying to read like i do with	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
it got fried while being recharged they for usd just look at it and said that they charge for repaing the damned thing	0
i love the storage in this thing	1
that with explain how to things	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
the battery is alot better than most of phones out there	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
it is very solidly and has a nice dense feel	1
is based can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the sound and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes out external noise	1
a phone call to the d link support crew was answered they me without a problem	1
they caused problem ie wrong product in the box service tech failed believe what the software said wrong	0
as often mentioned scroll is average difficult to use or horrible	0
door broke after a month	0
the included were uncomfortable	0
scroll button switch	0
the screen is large	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
the image quality is excellent	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
i happy these i ll probably more the front channels	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
technical support line the technical line helpful	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
much faster than with single processor	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
i have no problems with phone	1
creative from quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel about problems the headphone jack	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
purchased this player and have to say that i love it	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
looks	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
it perfectly for about a week then came	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
the only problem i have is is stiff	0
but the can so loud that i it inside my office when was out on the street	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
the phone line was for my giving technical support stars	1
and the picture great when set up with s connector	1
also was set up route to my the process was exactly the as my old netgear	1
fact it caused to hang more times than not so and stuck	0
the sound quality is fantastic it is to this stacks of cd is or tapes	1
when st tried i found that it no problem the more dvd media disc other players would play to my surprise was play cheep media that i had burned nt get to in but the dvd burner itself that had made the disc with	1
like	1
you can on it which is a plus all you people who want to buy an ipod just to you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
despite its being slightly larger i must say i was surprised to see when i unwrapped	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
the screen is bright easy see in the daylight with nice colors	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
i have to say m also pretty impressed the user playing jpeg mpeg	1
this unit was fine for st and a half then the color signal	1
the keyboard is also very nice and comfortable it take used to	1
i think look	1
p fantastic little does everything had hoped for	1
not only the perfect size it has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
however a budget i this is an excellent choice	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did do enough for me the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
all suprisingly	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
i nt be a sensationalist but incredible	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
if i were to these speakers on my listening needs would give a stars but giving because i think they do the job most people want them for	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
recent price have made the g the best bargain in cameras currently available	1
easy to hook	1
disappointed me the fact that it does seem read certain dvds	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
when you phone in your pocket is there it so light	1
honestly i love this player	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
worked great and we	1
works great	1
and all i am extremely pleased with camera	1
if you nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and can not searched via artist as the zen	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
color screen is good	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
this is extemely lame	0
volume level is ok	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and even features	1
overall i like	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the data rate over the network storage i only it for so it does nt	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
and works great too	1
this nt me because it is still	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
respond to my emails and the phone constantly busy	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
with this box is it reboots times an if not more frequently	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
it has never worked	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
absolutely amazing the camera	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
last note i purchased this with a higher price what you can get in the states	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i would this product to anyone	0
was positive	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i followed easy instructions in and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with os if you use it	1
great camera great investment	1
settings be adjusted for personal preference	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
price	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
my dwl ap does not work as for di s and there is no firmware to support this product	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
billy joel was kidding you get more mileage from a cheep pair	1
i d venture to say because of is low cost it is best pc stereo set out there costwise	0
my gut tells the long run albeit on which i can t create folders or lesson companies never to buy again	0
full spectrum from to great highs	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
the network still functioned but would pass	0
operating its many features is and often obvious i no annie lebovitz i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing at a camera store	1
i the firmware the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is and it resolved all my problems	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
i spent hours i could nt connect to the internet	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the is superb with nokia pc suite software	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
itself has all sorts of problems	0
but after sound but the video	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i sure it can be in a different one where would only your volume to at a whisper	1
for that is less even the lowest level ipod i was able this gb monster the best it as great as was advertised to then some	1
software the software is crap	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
it is easy beginners has features more serious photographers will is an excellent camera to grow into	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
while i would like to instead of i gave it a because it run for me during the time i have owned it	0
m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate wire in the bottom of the base	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
the replacement was even worse than was now working fine	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the keys are close together and the layout a bit to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
looks very cool and quite and very light	1
the and interface are very easy to use	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
tech support	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
however it does not play windows media and i can not get play any of my divx rips	0
also has	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
not counting time i spent editing the songs transfer	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
i love this player am extremely happy with my decision	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
matter format	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the canon g tons of control but still has mode that very easy for the novice to use	1
i sent my monitor in to for for such a small but very problematic of random buzzing from my acer gd hz	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither nor the version	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
if re for a quality tower speaker this	1
storage capacity	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
has a minor inconveniences but only lacks bluetooth spend but there are very few problems with things you expected this phone to do	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
