it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1

looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
i a this new product and pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but is the price for state of the art	1

as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1

from which time picture failed completely	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
i mentioned mediasource software actually really robust despite others have said though	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
the monitors were both good	1

in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
time link support was and guided me to actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed my fios optical network block	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1

the unit works with for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
user replaceable battery	1
in program id tag is a strong point as well	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it is a learning curve for it just right users say they success rate find it they just device	1

the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good you have everything	1
all the features the i pod has and if you if amazon your only to pay for this great player	1
they have a bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0

this model will not work with my universal remote control	0
fm or voice recording would been nice extras	0

the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
the infrared is a blessing you have a previous nokia want transfer your old phone to this phone saved me hours of re my	1
is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
does tend to run hot and be given of room for air circulation	0
not only is it runs it is also eye candy	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think as well	1

sounds great and less expensive than is	1
the sound quality very exceptable	1
with zennx easily overcome with rd party earphones software	0
convenient to scroll etc	1
the moveable lcd screen is	1
nomad is color better but it is not flashy	0

i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1

way less expensive than the ipod	1
to ears just as good and sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1

the controls very intuitive and learned how to through the menus quickly	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
user	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the brick and mortar and they both delivered great results	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
the picturers are amazing	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
the remote works but it does not work left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
because this camera	1
i unreservedly the powershot g to looking for a first digital camera a reasonable price is no there	1
very to use	1
navigation could be better there is nt anything the xtra t you ve comfortable with it	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
both the white speakers are	0
color screen is good	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
the remote is flimsy feeling awkward to use	0
i it only produced sound a cd played with a dvd i only got no picture	0
it more than days and it not show the picture no matter what i do	0
i excellent hearing the level on is especially	1
price	1

are surprisingly quick through usb	1
will some in it you can t avoid that	0
the speakers are about it good for the size the range you might expect perhaps even better expected rrb	1

is great	1
since am an office i normally keep them a pretty low and at low volumes they sound weak	0
it has much router it	1
i hooked up and seemed to be going fine	1
the sound so good that one now	1
i have been to find that there instructions it which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
ordered on lrb around with no extra shipping costs my door in chicago the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i know unit have problems in the for the year no asked replacement warranty worth it since creative will only for days which in itself totally ridiculous	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
pictures come out if shake for a moment during the entire process of taking	0
for the price there nothing better	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
tried contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
the price and features it is really good	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
fact is could nt be easier to use	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
the player sometimes freezes not very big problem but	0
i love this player	1
i wished that they make the volumn a little bit louder	0
it for this being extremely easy use well laid out controls that be quickly	0
both the black and the white are priced and worth it	1
does not recognize player being connected and displaying player is library	0
you ca nt go wrong if what is good sound a small package	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out	1
it has failed to deliver on quality	0
which should be user friendly was	0
brightness is easy with four presets and i leave that for at rrb	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
is built and to	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
in addition it comes	1
is	1
not play the song at all wildly matter that the resting my desk	0
for a location i still think its	1
while i put off the price more than what paid amazon for this player	1
i found the controls very intuitive and how to manuver through	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
the labeling is mystery and just scrambling to put out fires	0
got it home i discovered the menu options for sending messages via either text or	0
for a relatively low	1
you store data on it which is a plus for all you people who to buy an ipod to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
speakerphone	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have even touched any equalizers	1
life is ok	1
both the speakers are	1
my only significant complaint sound quality	0
these	1
mid range best but it is certainly enough to satisfy anyone not looking spend on computer speakers	0
that a rare and valuable	1
it has which is average these cameras	0
it my greatest expectations in a mp camera	0
worth the wait ag neovo standout monitor has all this and more	1
in fact it my system to hang more times i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
i guess limited lifetime means it may take to collect on the warranty	0
have not seen any of the usual with i am very pleased	0
you have to press the hard frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to	0
this thing is great	1
are surprisingly through usb	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is than other cheaper apex units	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
this has happened and occasionally if we it will work it work one before	0
in all this is another excellent creative product	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
stopped workin	0
there barrel distortion when you do canon knows and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax that is what ot the picture	0
other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
amazon was wonderful about the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
great speakers overall	1
monitors are great for the price	1
that is a rare feature	1
i was disappointed in low end	0
less a month later the screen freezes eventually shows disc	0
door broke after a month	0
the larger lens gives better picture and the optical zooms gets just that closer	1
are amazing	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
loved the slim design	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the subwoofer is and s w and it still sounds unnatural even know turned all way down but all right these	0
fact it caused to hang more times than not so and stuck	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
changing colors help to with a quick glance	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
also it was very easy to set a route to as the process exactly the same as my old netgear	1
i files in my playlist at the moment and the random nice job mixing it up	0
i thought the software was decent enough it complicated to learn all	1
this is probably one the few dvd players at that can play everything you at it	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as it up	0
however for a budget i think this camera	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
also i had trouble reading mp cds	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
is as one would suspect	0
those used will find g very comfortable to	1
price	1
the with the canon g camera is that its will cause you to miss precious shots	0
the phone is small light and very	0
they are not wowable good	0
the goes in magnification which is nice but there is a display of the zoom size one the way down from the top of screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the infrared a if you have a previous and want to transfer old book hours of	1
overall	1
is for my to use	1
it holds much music and audio files	1
i have my ad back to apex because wo nt play disney other movies	0
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
progressive for a price	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
p s the remote control does seem to get times and nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
great features	1
are awesome and mention they were polyphonic	1
at the end of day what i was which allows me easily any album from my collection and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
selected it because it looked easy install	1
first player quality is superior to the ipod	1
useless is since it display window	0
think this is it is biggest flaw	0
the hard drive one morning before my class	0
flash all in flashes in small cameras get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
is good	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
is larger than the has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully the green backlight did	1
if you ve a slr mm camera the controls are	0
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1

scroll button switch	0
when its i gone through monitors	0
these speakers are great	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1

the is too small it took like a half hour just to to fit in cage	0
software is easy to use	1
the the radio which utterly useless	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
to my amazement was error prone	0
playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt easy as i would have liked	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the scene mode works for the remainder shots that are not going to in a regular setting	0
but it to work so well now that i do nt with it	1
lets review the songs before begins its transfer	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
great sound very long life very fast recharges removable battery size and great price	1
the player is fine	1
now when fails i have to and it	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
