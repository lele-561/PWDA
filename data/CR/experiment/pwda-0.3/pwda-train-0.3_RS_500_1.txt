good battery life	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
worked fine	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
found only problem that mls that the i is have it does not access with the internet service at all well very	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
my first impression was positive	1
so as it with all software bundled with creative products yes was useless and ugly	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
must the g delivers what quality overall considered the and image be of any current megapixel digicams from a point best color response of view detail tonal balance	1
this camera megapixel closest to is perfect any other digicam that is than	1
good range speed	1
to resistant scratches solid better heat dissipation	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
however some order where was to too bog in down it starting the latest bandwidth hogging software i the point having to reset to and my computer far to often it of was reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
over some inherent benefit feel that priced speakers do lastly unless for what i got lrb the there is i know that i were nt in the bose label of rrb	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
although the nokia is primarily is on the features department an outstanding piece short it of hardware to doing what be was a little a wireless telephone to do for it meant	1
all of first loud and clear calls were my unlike with sprint	0
very good value for the money	1
speakerphone	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
exasperated at am will i sending called it quits be and this awful deceptive product back	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
may collect that limited lifetime warranty means it guess take a lifetime to i on the warranty	0
and is a blessing if your old phone book have a previous nokia transfer want to me you to this phone hours the infrared saved of re entering my numbers	1
also for on the picture lots washed out to s video with some reason of color bleeding compared looks a component connection	0
my new nomad love i its great	1
even leaving it produces on default setting the crystal clear playback	1
slow download and run certain programs to wish you the hope best and my review helped	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
i ve than never thing all quite this a is treated had less well it dropped it and the headphone jack month for screwed up	0

this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
the they should some corners the player out of hard plastic and put have rubber on made cheap construction	0
the picturers are amazing	1
i disappointed and am looking the for that something can withstand elsewhere rigor of a business traveler	0
great powerful good interface replaceable sleep timers battery good software wake sound up modes play multiple	1
maybe it very my lack of camera but experience found shots with this is i disappointing	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
overall overpriced ipod apple great and less expensive sounds than is small	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
except matter and much larger which might not seem to far heavier while if running use it its or you keep it in your pocket	0
cover the that came well very did nt fit it with	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
nt the quick sync is any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly just useful is nt very or	0
there to any protection is offer no speaker grill to the driver	0
huge storage space you on can store a ton thing even at kbs this of songs	1
having for very fast transfers makes usb	1
fine expected to the x digital zoom be grainy impressive onfull size high to quite quality the zoomed images are i but	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
sound settings can for adjusted be personal preference	1

my gut tells me the nomad a lesson the will run portable never best a gb hard in drive albeit one on which long can buy products from again create folders in worst at i very expensive be or companies at to t	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
what great colorimetry has get in camera plus this you see is the lcd canon what you is	1
battery is ok life	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
unit worked great for weeks then failed output video	0
and support rude technical unhelpful	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
best in class sound	1
easy up hook to	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
depressing the button scroll is not always responsive	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
anything this phone perfectly it does does	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
i more buy i with these happy ll probably very m for the front channels	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
you this re looking for a quality tower speaker if is it	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
highly recommend this price point hard to beat at this monitor	1
for the price it nice a player is dvd very	1
very simple to use	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
i did ease of use think i this find would quality and m for under nt i thrilled my with purchase	1
easy not but it did work enough	1

all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice it feel to dense	1
material is on cheap the side	0
no dead pixels mine on	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0

this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1

apex think i player the best dvd get for the price you can is	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1

the daylight pictures are brilliant away that no more than about feet very good provided the indoor shots your subject is are and	1
the nomad like flashy is color better but it not is terribly i	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
great picture	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
about of the find it can the device time attach it to my pc when i t	0
too large number to for genre album track information change difficult of tracks	0
be stars not easily impressed by this five to i a little conservative but electronics product really tending deserves m	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
is is small so it my house hard of judge the real strenght in all rooms and corners through house in a no signal interruptions to walls but my the product the product worked perfectly of with lot	1
with all complicated the features quality the menus are easily accessible and features the of its is great	1
the just wheel is it it scroll works but most of the time is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find finicky so frustrating return they there that the device	0
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
pics focused the do be a bit challenging but instantly you perfectly need lighting adjustments delete pics can can nt like that are not and you or when make this camera very simple inside effective	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
all in all another excellent creative product is this	1
see can you the finder barrel view the in lens	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
otherwise is highly recommended this phone	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
after will years convert torture in several hands i at t customer and to am delighted to drop them service look forward of august when i of the our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
with eax on can you can your sound with different presets which is pretty good you modify get different variations with it	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
to and dropped to mbps the d link to mbps n connected speed hooked up wireless down extreme	0
this dvd play junk basicly is	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0

technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
valet plus and is easy to configure was set up in about minutes	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1

has is this a a small portable computer option wants anyone who all in all very good and for a lapdesk and external speakers	0

maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
was exceptional from the supplier the service	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
the me what to buy was it reviewer that said got would play dvd rs fill of files	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
first about the eax quality is okay but interference can cause the sound after audio minutes	0
selected it because to looked easy install it	1
be better designed could the interface used	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
mixed i was right guess but the price bag	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
with gb of storage have more about songs on the player i room for about with	1
the has the utterly useless which function is radio	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1

so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the top that much the covered kept a touch latch without battery of the near poping bottom off	0
positive was my first impression	1
the system is looking better than the ipods in size and design terrific imo	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
volume the	0
even music to the optional headset you can listen with better over integrated the radio	0
not find in the least well placed and i flimsy all of the controls	0

the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
