it sets itself up for success by being simple and easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
only one so i expect we will be looking at getting something of higher quality very soon	0
the next day i checked on it and it was still there but no internet connection	0
for those who are unaware of the fact that this is capable of producing lrb and for a non speaker rrb this is a problem	0
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment and produces a great sound with them	1
if life is good for you i recommend buying a camera or two for those emergency pics you have to have	0
i am giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the controls are much more complex compared to the simple ipod ones	1

this page	1
i know the apex is a number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
i have no complaints at all	1
it has a few problems one is that you do not want to play one song after another on a cd	0

all the functions of the gadgets are on the sides of the phone which is convenient for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	0
while i did the positive things were good sound quality and an excellent user interface and design	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the smaller size	1
part of the problem is that it was for me and many others	0
this is one of the things that i love	1
this has happened with us and if we keep doing something it will happen again when it did not before	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0

made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1

i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
in fact others say not at all	0
i purchased both of these cameras at the same time from amazon and we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
the monitors are	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
it would have been much nicer if it had zoomed in so you could see the screen and if the screen did zoom in	0
you have to press all the buttons at once and sometimes i end up having to enter when i meant to scroll	0
feedback on the product is very positive and is universally positive this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	1

to my amazement even that process was possible	1
this is the third time i have seen them and they continue to impress for the fans	1
i love this player and i will probably play with creative labs again	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1

it looks and feels quite small to me and very small	0
your browser does not support if it can t play some of your supported dvds	0

i have yet to test out all of the shutter speeds and the priority light metering settings but i think they are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1

this app is good with a huge array of apps and games built into it	1
its a shame when you pay for a router and it does not work as it is supposed to out of the box	0
the light auto correction system	0
i find all of the controls here and here in the wiki	0
the remote is flimsy and unreliable	0
only thing that keeps me from creative is a cd burner	0
the quick sync is nt any good if it wants to be fast or just fast	0
newbies will find the full auto mode will give them perfect pictures straight out of the camera	1
the person on the other end of the line can help you out	1
i dont know about you but the volume level on this phone is insane	0
to my knowledge even that process was error free	0
just received it a few days ago and i love the features it has	1
a person is a person as a whole and is not a person with one or two good qualities	1
i think this is a great deal and i really love it	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0

the device itself is pretty good	1

you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
a compact camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
the screen is brighter than the previous model and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen much better than the nx is green backlight did	1
working for hours with it on the beach on the rocks	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi and bluetooth modules	1
it does not look pretty spending this kind of cash you know but that has to be a bit down of course	0
while not as sleek and elegant as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is a great alternative to a good cddb service it is also free	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already created you can do so	0
i highly recommend it	1

size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not break	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
just an average user but there is good value in this product	1

it is easy to use and it is very feature rich	1
it may	1
for the games and features it supports	1
the big screen makes it easy to see and the screen is big enough for people to see	1

we tried to edit and when we tried to chapter the frames would start to freeze for no reason	0
download the automatic playlist on creative lets you review the songs before it downloads them download now	1

i think it is great although i m not watching on an iphone thanks	1
the router connects to my other wifi routers easily and further setup is easy	1
while in the memory the keyboard connector is connected	1
you will find the full auto setting will take them right out of the game enjoy	1
even when you reboot it will upon reboot keep saying your password is invalid even when it will try and force you to tell it that it is authorized	0
its fast and easy to use and work better than those of other models i ve had	1
the only issue i have is that when you click in the scroll wheel to scroll you have to click twice or it crashes sorry	0

this small size speaker system can be used to put out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
the customer also exhibited impatience when going to the menu	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
this camera is mounted on a tripod in auto mode with a loud sound which can t be heard	0
the software i use however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound much better with it than without it	0
i think that the remote controller stand with it is very nice and simple selector buttons	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
the game was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
the car will be running for the cost of a replacement battery just like before	1
i have been trying to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to respond to their emails and the phone is constantly busy as the one customer service rep is always busy	0
the screen is bright and easy to see in the daylight with good contrast and colors	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite responsive although it does have some quirks	1
newbies will find it will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
they had a pretty comfortable stay in place and were	1
over all a great experience which made us experience life on a totally new level	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that he didn t have it didn t work either	0

this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
so if you re looking for something that is a little more affordable and you just want a router to be able to do basic networking and play mafiawars and surf myspace then this is for you	1
we own one of these speakers and i am very pleased with the quality of the these compact speakers especially at the price these are for here on earth	1

it is so small but big value for money	1
also this player is a plus unlike my previous player	1

however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
the use of eax batteries is important at times especially when you listen to a lot of music as it will act as the equalizer battery which can be a big hassle	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1

it is versatile and has the potential to be one of the best	1
i hate widescreen monitors	0
he was nt kidding when he said you get more than you expect from a cheep set of speakers	1
for the price of the sound that comes out of it	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1

to download them you have to get the link cable to download the additional files they are full of stink and you ca	0
i lived in a small college apartment the e s and f s were beautiful but not for what i wanted	1
in that model the hard drive just died on me	0
the things that are really cool like the radio	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
by setting the shutter to the lowest setting and getting the camera ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to expectations	1

they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is disconnected	0
i have been disappointed to see that there is no printed instructions with it just a short instruction of how to use it which leaves a great deal of room for error	0

but with a low price comes a high risk	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
well within days the video output was working	1

the zoom can go up and down in size but there is always the issue of the zoom size going down from the top of the screen that interferes with looking at things	0
user replaceable user	1
you can do other different things with it such as changing what you think of now to something else you can see the interface as modern or classical	1

so if you are just someone that is a little scared of technology and you just need a router to get online do you want to sit and watch netflix and play games all day this router is for you	0
i can see a drastic difference between the two in terms of quality	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
over all a fantastic camera which made us love photography on a totally different level	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically as you say	0
when i saw the video on the internet the first thing that hit me is how beautiful it is	1
the camera works well and the x digital zoom is a very nice feature although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
the bluetooth earpiece is very responsive and easy to use	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
that along with the replaceable battery were the main reasons i picked the nomad	1
the case is too complicated and it took me like a half hour just to get it to work	0
the quality of the quality is very good	1
i dont know but less than a month is not an acceptible amount of time for something like this	0

they re pretty comfortable to use and deliver a decent level of quality	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
i have not been able to play with all the features yet but the app is easy to use once you get used to it	1
you can buy the metz here it has a hot shoe that can be used and fortunately for me i have owned a few of the highest quality external flashes that i can buy i love the metzz	1
i love the product but it just did not work	0
the option was to go with the windows home professional instaled but other netbooks with windows installed doesnt allow and i forgot to mention this especially with the increased price	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
it was super easy to set up out of the box and i had all my files downloaded and everything connected to the internet in minutes	1
i love it though and will be sending this awful deceptive email back thanks at am i right	1
playlists can be created on the fly without aid of a computer and you can even set up automatic playlists like shuffle and repeat for your now playing tracks or playlists	1

the woofer is large	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0

the headphones are small but you can really get a lot out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0

the zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor ergonomics of using the scroll wheel and lack of consistent feedback about how to interact with it	0
the sounds were as they were intended	1
i like it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
this phone is a blessing if you are old and want to transfer your old phone number to this phone saved me a lot of time entering my numbers	1
after loading songs all i get now is a message saying im either not connected or unavailable	0
this router does crash every once in a while but not nearly as often as the old router did	0
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
both the black and the white versions are economically priced and available	1
it is not clear	0
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
but i have spoken to some creative tech people about it and they said they will fix it for me if necessary	1
unfortunately it does not work with windows media and i can not get it to play any music	0
i did not have to think about how to operate it it was just intuitive	0
selected it because it was free and easy to install	1

the moveable lcd screen is great	1
i am using it as surround sound which is again a very nice feature of the speaker set	1
battery life is very short i think and i have to recharge it every few hours or days or so	0
we own two of these and i am very pleased with the quality of the these and especially at the price that these sell for here on ebay	1
it is fast and packed with a lot more features	1
when i played a lot of games where there was no sound i was sure that the sound would not be there	1
full capacity	1
the car is not working either and the driver has been working with other people to fix it which is very dumb	0
they claim to respond in a hour period but it is never done	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1

this post also has links to it	1
audio is unavailable	0
they caused the problem because the product was defective and the company tech failed to believe what the manufacturer said was wrong	0
this is a little hard to understand	0
all in all this is a very good deal for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and a keyboard	1
so go ahead and brag to your friends who are looking for a dvd player that can t do half the things ours can and for a fraction of the price	1
i had no problem using what was already on my computer to load onto this unit	1
i find this to be a great feature	1

the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
it did also seem to have a nice new smell for some reason	0
i can get off easily but i always have my phone in the car so i did nt do it	0
both of the problem with this is that it repeatedly pauses during playback while the counter on the player is going	0

no problems with this router unlike the netgear router it replaced which only had one port	1
loading was a bit time consuming but i think it would have been with the same as before	0
it has many good things and very few bad things	1
those used to it will find the g very comfortable and easy to use	1
i also did nt like the way it puts the information down into the screen when you are in the middle	0
the steering wheel is simple it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it to get it to work they have success rate some people find it so easy that they just return the wheel	1
this is my first time using this player and it is definitely a fine product	1
now that money can buy the metz ct	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
some people have problems with the small hole on the bottom that is on the front cover has not been an issue for me and is not noticeable if you look closely as the case may be	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased that in a few months it will be available but that is the price for the state of the art	1
i used this monitor for years and now it is a mixture of old and new	0
simply the canon g is the best out there today	1
it also does not have voice activated dialing big minus	0
some people have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal as long as the case is sturdy and offers good protection	1

the software is quick easy to use i found the app to be very useful	1
one last note i would not recommend this monitor with anything other than what you can get in the states	0
the weather is nice	1
the sound is a little lrb but not anything too bad there is reflection but i only really notice it when the screen is off and you can see you own reflection on the screen	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
note that it is a public display for the u s navy	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not paying attention you will nt hear a thing	0

weaknesses the size and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt fit in the palm of your hand with really long names you must scroll through them before getting back to normal size	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and needs a quick and easy way to work	1
but it can be said that i heard it ringing in my office when i was already out the door	1
the screen is small and easy to press the battery is a decent size but the power on off is low	0

the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
takes excellent care	1
dr johns sound system	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the computer is useful when backing up from my computer	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency conversion and a built in camera	1
they had a pretty comfortable stay in place and were	1
loved the slim design	1
by cocking the shutter to manual and changing the settings when i wanted to shoot i was able to get great results contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
cars for example are an excellent option but not on this list editing by elaine lies	0
you can do this with the free suite i e free from midi or free from any picture on your computer and if you know how to use it you can even make your own free software	1
the subwoofer is f and s l o w and it still sounds good with the speakers but it is better because these are computer speakers	0

works great	1
of course i was only given one but i ve been using it since i got it and i got a second one as a christmas present for my friend	1
tech support from apex court	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
even though your services are of superb quality your support is equal to the task thank you	1
my computer is working just fine	1
this is about right for the size and weight of this camera	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the same thing happened	0

huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
a week out and i began to feel the effects of the medication from time to time and each day	0
the color code makes this free after rebates phone calls and text messages are very important	0
other than that i guess they are usb activated headphones and a standard mm headset jack	0
update the mirror is more mirror than mirror and i love it	1
i have had no problem what so ever	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with you about the whole thing	0
setup time from start to completely finished and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
the free shoe flash that allowed me to buy and use shoes	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and great camera	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
its free and you can stream it to your tv and watch all the silent movies that you want if you wanted to	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
i love you	1
it was slow and i had to be patient as i was trying to winxp the player and dragging and dropping the files into it it is not plug and play you need to download the game first and mediasource to play	0
even better you do not have to pay	1
it is very cool and seems very small to me and my friends	1
the explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as a file so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from one location to another browse through them here	1
im setting it up for my mom right now but that was quick enough for me to find out whats up with it i have only had this mp player for about a month	1

i think youll love this feature	1
discs and music cds are available and then concludes no disc it seems like a good deal but this pos is can not be bought	0
for the price of this product i could not ask for more	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the app is easy to navigate can modify existing playlists and has a removable battery it has a huge storage capacity for music	1
what really got me was the reviewer that said it was a dvd rs fill of files	1
also it was very easy to set up a route as long as the route was exactly the same as my route	1
the last year has been a steady performer for me	1
this app is a replacement for your desktop	1
i think that it is a fantastic product for the price	1
best in class performance	1
to be fair even that process was error prone	0
but if speed reliability and power to transmit data across the house are important then we will do the same	0
its easy to go online and adjust it there	1
if it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
i wished that they could have played the song a little bit louder	0
the ability to send an email directly to the server is a nice feature when i need to back up from my various computers	1

the game was not finished and the game was in alpha stage at best	1
there was also a lip sync issue	0
i have three words to keep myself going with the s but the first one is a little powerhouse	1
now there is only one thing i have about it and that is the mbyte that comes with it for free i only use it in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the m byte with a mbyte cf	0
the ipod user interface and battery is a great improvement over the ipod is great	1
i have had this monitor for years and now it is a mixture of old and new and de focused	0

then copying the files is as easy as pie	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
i personally have no complaints over this	1
while the ease of use is great i was put off by the price being higher than what i found on amazon	1
i think i like it	1
it has all the features one would need	1
my only real complaint is sound quality	1
it plays basically every song i ve ever written so its music that i ripped years ago and the rental that will nt be played on it	1
main dial is not backlit	0
the downside though is that it does not work well when the temperature is low	0
i have tried enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss of detail and not even getting the best possible results as yet	0
the news which comes out is not good at all	0
well within days the computer and its output quit working	0
you will be changing your cd a lot because the cd database that is utilized by your computer is mediocre at best	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
i purchased it and it got fried while being recharged they asked for a refund just now and said that they would reimburse me for it	0
i love it	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to the end it started to freeze for some reason	0
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
i do nt think that really matters but i was able to hook it up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
item turned out it was in great condition with easy to use set up and we have nt had to set the router at all so far since it is installed so my wife is already giving me the thumbs up about using her wireless internet	1
it did not seem to have a strong new smell for me	0
does what it should and thats what matters to me	1
if you want just to say you have an ipod do not worry this is a much better buy also you can store data in the cloud which is a great feature for those who want to keep an eye on it	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
bass fanatics look forward	1
i will never be able to make a creative product again	0
this thing is awesome	1

i was hoping that acer was nt more helpful	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the reason i gave it a four is because of that darn speed dial its very slow and hard to use so you can t get an accurate reading	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
we were impressed with the quality of the food	1
cheap crap they should have made it out of hard plastic and put some paint on it	0
ripping the screen even with my poor connection speed and the quality is excellent	1
the color screen is also available as are the following ringtones	1
over all a very good camera which has taken us all to on a totally new level	1
how this product was created and was left behind	0
the problem is that the fastest thing that has happened to it has been around forever even when in the same place	0
overall the nikon is a very little fish	0
i would venture to say that because of it is low cost it is a very good product costwise	1
the bottom line is that this is an excellent game enjoy	1

great way to display a picture and poster for my desk	1

after years with that carrier is expensive plans and high prices this deal seemed heaven sent	1
also the player sometimes is not a player at all but can also be annoying	0

it does not have an auto focus in low light which is nice for low light shots in general but it is hard to use it low light	0
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
the new one was even worse than the original one which was now in ruins	1
image clarity in raw files i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately	1

great picture	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i should have trusted all the online comments about the terrible performance of the team of course	0
in fact if you re someone that is single and you just want to sit around and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day then this is great for you	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0

it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the song was playing on my computer	0

i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
the usb port on the back	0
for the fun and games you can t beat the price	1
one of the cons a tad bulky not the most powerful player and does not support a folder stucture	0
this camera is amazing and i highly recommend it	1

there are	1
my pictures on my phone are great but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
everything was great until it became difficult to get internet connection sporadically	0

even with it on the default mode it produces poor playback	0
the canon computer software that allows you to store sort upload and manage your digital files on the computer is very powerful and powerful	1

i have not had this before and am more impressed with it than any i have used before	1
it is very easy for beginners to use but has features that professional photographers will appreciate so it is easy to grow into	1
when the person speaks the voice is not very clear	0
i have excellent hearing but the sound level on my phone is especially quiet	0

fragile	0
it easily fits in a backpack and it is not heavy	1
how the apple watch lets you sync to more than one computer	1

navigating through the menus is a bit tricky if you have not used a previous model nokia phone	0
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
i think it is very functional and i can use it in the car and even with freeway noise	1
i m glad it is there and can be useful in a different way than a phone where you only need it to be at a whisper	1
not only is it cheap but its a great way to save money which is what i have	1
so anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the side of the router because the remote control on the router did nt work	0

i have not had the chance to really push this player too much but the results on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
the value gb vs gb ipod for the iphone	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
the reception and the food are top notch	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
the keypad is easy to use but the switch on off button is small and difficult to press	0
it does not only have trouble playing dvd movies it also has trouble properly playing movies	0
i hate the lack of games on this phone	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
the remote control but then it dies and you are left standing there wondering what you are doing with your life	0
about of course it can t be the same when i upload it to my pc	0
it is small and light and nice to hold and the display is decent as well	1
this was very prompt and shipping was great	1
well there are a lot of people and there was still a lot more noise	0
no dropouts and good signal strength all over my three story house unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and operation	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits right into my pocket	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps eee pc and pcs all connect to the internet	0
the system is also very flexible	1
despite this minor flaw i highly recommend the canon g to anyone who is serious about canon	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and the memory is so small it is not enough	0
they may be more comfortable but no one is in control	1
this product description	1
the dvd player is	1
i have not played with all the features yet but it is easy to use once you get the hang of it	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the new one is very easy to use and easy to set up	1
well on keypad	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
beautiful home theater and music with crisp highs defined mids and lows	1
i try to avoid horns but i do nt want to be overly extreme	0
what made this a mediocre mp player for me was the sound quality	0
i love this book and am extremely happy with my purchase	1
the sound quality is very good	1
we have purchased a few so far all claiming to work for our players and none worked	0
so i have not had much luck reading svcds that i created and uploaded im sorry	0
user replaceable user	1
the scene mode works only for a subset of shots that are not related to the scene	0
the auto mode works well but i dont like having the auto modes they are dummy proof and not suited to situations in which i would ever seek to use the camera	0
it was very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
it looks great out on the porch or on my night stand	1
unfortunately the internet did not allow me to download any of my region one dvds even though they were not pirated in any way	0
all in all bad device and you will suffer like hell from this product	0
bought the new xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
its so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to use them and the only thing that works with it is	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
overall i like the game	1
software is another great misfortune of mine i have frequently screwed my computer up does not work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
it is more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer i have ever owned	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n speed up to mbps and extreme n down to mps	0
and i am and as such i trust the system with my life	1
this was very helpful for my shipping service	1
the software has nt been a problem for me so far	1
here is the brief description of the product it is plastic it feels kind of plastic like but not	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to the graphics and sound	1
no matter the format	1
took me a while to get use to it but it is a very good player imo	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
no it has none	0
my camera has a few issues and i have nt gotten around to all of them yet its new and i dropped it and it still works fine this time	1
i think the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
i think the reason that made the changes is that it now uses a	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
after that i changed the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at the is website and it worked fine	1
i m very happy with my zx so here is a picture of it	1
i could tell this was a bad idea as soon as i set it up	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
then my dvds would either be playing in the middle or not able to be read at all	0
the post was not sent as long as you have an adminstrative user account	0
what you do get is what you pay for in reliable products	1
the progressive motion controls can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the best and easiest remote controls i have ever used	1
but if you have never used a slr mm then these are very intuitive	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i did not get any wierd sounds from my new speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
this article is based on autofocussing in auto mode with auto mode which can t be stopped	0
at the time of my work constituants owned the book and highly recommended the canon for picture books thank you	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
both the black and the white speakers are black and white	0
i did this and i found that copying files from the player to the clipboard was easy too https www youtube com watch v x x x f w	1
the article is large and easily read	1
the reaction from the player is ok	1
her work is phenomenal	1
the setup system for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is terrible	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
it has very good range and is better than others	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
the tiny camera is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter but it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the software mediasource can not work properly	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
despite the problems that i have listed so far i can live with this cd player because it keeps me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the morning	1
it is small and cheaper than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because ipod is less expensive but not necessarily because it is used more	1
the sound quality is good but it gets a tad too quiet at times when there are people on the other end of the line	0
the problem is large	1
i find it to be a great buy	1
i was a little disappointed in the end	0
as a tech person i was surprised to see that the cisco valet could get to the hotspot in less than minutes	1
price along with the quality of the battery were the two main factors on why i chose the nomad	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
yes there is a corner lens that causes distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom in canon knows this and engineered it not to be noticeable that is what makes it great	0
i reiterate my down rating for t mobile as a stock	0
the sound this slim design makes	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
the features are unmatched for any camera in the market all the picture quality and features which are too good to ignore	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was working but the hard drive was not	0
very good value for the money	1
the fridge will be running for the duration of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
having listened to so much music where do you go from here	1
there is an alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
the camera comes with a manual and the very best camera app which has optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
but canon never ceases to amaze	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
does not provide enough volume when compared to the	0
i may not be inclined to agree	0
it was one of the best days because ag neovo is standout and has all this and more	1
its fine	1
i gave it a rating of stars out of	1
still i was willing to give it a try as this unit is very affordable and has a myriad of features	1
the camera does not present you with the image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by the light in the camera	0
bottom line is for all of these things to work and have tons of good bass	1
for me it is really good	1
i have a guestnetwork and having just dropped the price for this router i was very unimpressed	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
i found using the mediasource to upload your songs to the nomad app to be much easier and faster than using the explorer	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
both times the dvd is would repeatedly stop playing during playback while the music on the player kept going	0
its out of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
would nt do it again because of the customer service	0
and so i have not had much luck with dvds lately	0
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
in which others are not bright enough	0
i have to say i m very impressed by the user interface for the jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on the server	1
having the opportunity to listen to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to the songs as they are played directly from the player	1
no more pixels on mine	1
i love it and i will probably go with creative labs again	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i agree with those who say that there is a very limited amount of viewing time in order to achieve this contrast	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
it has a x optical zoom which is x zoom	0
this router is	0
so far the router has worked	1
and the sound well there is no doubt	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the night shots are excellent provided that the light is no more than	1
i ve had the same unit with it it worked well when i had it on top of a portable radio but was awful when i tried to use it in the car which is rare	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
in the case of i nt it will give good results on idiot program auto mode	1
the battery life is amazing	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpful once you actually used it	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
i am enjoying my phone so much	1
the flight mode that keeps the battery at the same level for the whole flight will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
the installer recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop the files from windows explorer to a folder for the disk you can browse through windows explorer here	1
it is a very strong signal and has a good signal strength	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
either way can t go wrong right	1
you re going to have to buy new headphones the stock market is down	0
and with usb transferring files to your player is easy	0
i think i had to do with that my eyes are getting bigger and i do not have to close my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen anymore	1
great value gb for gbgreat value for the price	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i was trying to figure out that how could this dvd player play files which allow me to stack movies on a dvd but it said it was unable to play the files which i created with smart ripper	0
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
and since he has it for such a good price how can you go wrong	1
highly recommend both the bluetooth dongle and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
also the feature to search for information in the search information is nt always available	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
it is very nice the controls are easy to use the battery lasts for hours on one single charge the software is very good and it is beautiful in the casing	1
this thing is huge and i like to use it to keep up with my work and also to refer to my old track records	1
now heres what you should do starting with the scroll button and the blue light in the middle which is perfect as hell in music videos both are easy to use after mastering the scrolling button and sound and i ve got a lot of	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
because she is beautiful	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
i tried it out and it works great for me i noticed that the volume for the phone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the same time to improve the sound quality so i do nt complain for	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the only reason i don t give it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to read so you can t see it thanks	0
i i d say this is a good deal for the money	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
i am quite fond of having a lot of music stored on this baby as well as a few songs of my own in the data folder	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
i have used this for years and it is a great tool	1
i was wondering what the problem was and i would like to use it when i am done	0
i am not willing to accept shoddy construction on my house i am	0

for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
very bad quality	0
audio files can not be created for the audio files	0
connection to the internet is so easy	1
music organization is important and this can be especially important for older childrens music programs with missing or incorrect age information	1
it will only move from side to side lrb no up down or tilt down	0
i i d buy another	1
on average my shots with a flash are not as good as my regular shots	0
in this case well leave it as is since it obscures display window	0
you can see the lens of the camera in the view finder	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
for those who dont like the thump that this is the sound of a lrb speaker for a computer speaker rrb this is	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality and quantity of the product	0
as a whole it has a sleek design and looks fine	1

i am amazed and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can hardly put up with the cameras noise because i have never seen anything like it before	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
the color screen makes this even after rebates phone shine bright and the speakers are very good	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield the same results on the other mode	1
it has a population which is average for the area	0
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the woofer is much larger	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
i found the controls very intuitive and i knew how to manuver through the menus	1
the features are really cool to listen to on the radio	1
i remain hopeful	1
as it stands right now the game is free if you are packing the player up for travel or if you load up the game beforehand	1
you can create playlists drag drop them from cd to your player and save them as playlistsdrag drop playlists from cd from your player	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to report and i cant wait to see when i will be able to use our other products from at t to purchase	0
when i bought it to use for my daughter is when i plugged it in and the speaker wire worked as expected even out of the box	1
it is beautiful the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the screen is bright and it is covered in it chrome finish	1
price gb of storage	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard dial tone on the phone	0
the manual mode is easy to use with options for control of shutter speed and iso without having to go through the manual options	1
for me it is a well worth the investment	1
i lost them very shortly after getting them	0
by phone	0
t is very good too i got it from t here	1
the first night i got this phone i used it next to my bed when i went to sleep just to listen to my music and the handset itself does nt work and i	0
our special friends at b h audio gave this thing a great sound quality and great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
the windows premium is good and i do like the starter rrb and user friendly	1
i ve been there and done that at the same time and while it does work the whole experience is not the same for me	0
troubles with comparing data storage with price	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
whether you re going for a brisk jog in the park or just having a chat you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
the included eax player is useful at times like when you want to listen to a variety of genres as it will allow you to choose which can be a big help	1
the build quality is excellent	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the problem is that it is connected to nokia so the headphones will not work	0

for the fun and games you can t beat it	1
after we got the phone number we tried to contact them but we never got in touch with them the customer service telephone number is disconnected and they do not answer their phone	0
the result from the nomad is operating in the desert ani	0
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
ripping it off and creating will nt be any easier	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not seem to be reliable	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in minutes	1
sounds like a good product	1
when i tried it only produced the sound but when i only got the audio no sound	0
but too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to switch among city lights he said i had a panic	0
you can move the camera to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on and off button that can be really helpful if shooting a scene that is very close to the camera	1
the other issue is that the headphone jack is exclusive to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
this router is	0
first of all the problem is sound quality is very poor	0
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some great pics of the kids too	1

wyja nienie fantastic esp w iphone docked	0
the scroll of death is a travesty enough said	0
the pictures come out better if your hands are free for a moment during the taking of the a picture	0
due to the lack of features for a router with a guestnetwork and having just bought the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
i have not yet seen any of them with the pictures so i am not sure	0
this color was only there for the st week and a half and then the color completely disappeared	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the picture when you do nt zoom canon like this and fix it that is what leads to the distortion phenomenon that is why you see the picture	0
it is not	1

so far the router has worked	1
good range speed	1
you can keep looking this is what you will find today on the internet i am writing this on nov rrb	0
however a quick call to the d c support crew was made in a reasonable amount of time and they walked me through the process of reporting a problem	0
but if you re looking for my opinion on something i have it	1
excellent heavy build quality and weight they are not imposing and blend well into the rest of my collection	1
i dont think that it is a laptop it is more than a regular laptop	0
get the best price for all the features	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1

my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
the screen quality in the side view is	1
and with that transferring files to your computer is incredibly easy	1
surprisingly it seems to work well	1
i think i would recommend this router in every home with large or small buisiness environmnets	0
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
i have had no problem with it	1
the system is terrific in my opinion and is looking better than the competition	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
if you re looking for a challenge this is it	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
now when all else fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
i just received my very first zen book and i m extremely happy with it	1
going to the movies is so easy	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the most part of the settings without having to go through menu options	1
the ram did not work as a breeze for me it worked fine fast and with the extra ram i could stop it but it took longer than expected so i will change it as soon as possible	0
highly recommended this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
what is disappointing is the drop in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
they did and the picture turned out quite nice	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
it will nt play all of my movies	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am very happy with the purchase	1
you cant really go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a great sound in a small package	1
her response was prompt	1
very easy to set up	1
without a doubt the best looking apex dvd release that i have ever seen	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it works and does nt get in the way	0
i highly recommend a nokia	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful and helpful tech	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
for the most part this year	1
this is amazing	1
it did slow down a few times while i was working and i had to reboot but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just to start up again	0
you can not get a decent amount of treble or bass at any level without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect it to be as sound	0
it is easy enough to pop it on to the radio station you are listening to	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes or so but the wait was worth it	0
i have had it for years treated it quite well never had any problems with it and the headphone jack is all wired up	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
i dont know what this is it is weird	0
price	1
this laptop will change your idea of what a laptop should be	1
the controls are a bit inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i wanted to tell you myself my story but the kids were waiting to go to the store so i never got to	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
after looking for a feature phone and a travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality and the price	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on automatically and it will continue to play just as you left it when you were turning it off	1
the colours are nice no question about it the price is reasonable for the size the range is what you might expect from a product of this size lrb perhaps even better than some of the others	1
it does make you smell like burning plastic when you make the drive	1
he is a good person and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
this was my first nonflip phone and i was so excited that i decided to go with them	1
i tried as many of different formats to see if it would work and it did	1
i think it was due to the fact that it broke when i tried to move it from a fairly short distance	0
the service from the supplier was discontinued	0
my other big complaint about it is the price	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
first the cons a folder is not the same as a player and does nt have a folder stucture	0
this means that there is a good chance that the phone will not break as much as typical american phones	0
frame freezes and the dvd player wont play the movie somethings wrong with thedvd player come quick	0
well this is a dvd player too	0
technology wise i think this is awesome and the speaker makes it even great i would recommend this to everyone	1
with this feature on you can modify it with different presets which is how you can get the most out with it	1
the hands free speakerphone is also available	1
i just wish that they could make it a little bit louder	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
i have an xp box and when installing the enclosed software i did get a message that there was a problem installing it	0

b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about minutes for a cd on my pentium pc	1

sound quality and base is amazing	1
the phone has a different type of wireless charging system from others the battery needs to be charged while youre using it but it allows you to use the camera while its in use without running down the battery	1

it has lots of little cute features like being able to control the lights and the music and the radio	1

this is a winner	1
the flash photos are never great and there was a lot going on enjoy	1
but anyway the only thing you should be looking at here is the fact that the world does have a future	1

i think this is great	1
the way in which relationship with player is not good at all	0

the explorer program did shut down a few times while i was doing this but i did nt have to restart explorer or anything just open up explorer again	0

a week out of the box and i began to get a taste of the world from time to time and i enjoyed each day	1
but i dealt with this as it was still happening so	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0

beautiful home theater and music room with great sound and respectable bass	1
the software is free and i could use it when i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
all i can say is that this is a good thing	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
it is still there so i picked it up and turned it on its side	0
how the device has worked for me for the past year	1
the router has also had problems with static ip addresses and numerous other issues	0
but with a low price comes a high risk	0
this is good although i would recommend a water filter or a alkaline filter for those emergency pics you have to have	1
it is worth it	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
you can create a drag drop drag and drop to your clipboard and rip directly from there to your computer	1
the volume	0
i ve listened to all of these discs and they all play well	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
its ability to serve as a stand up for the underdog	1
the catch with the new camera is that it will not allow you to take precious shots	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass level the sound comes outs exceedingly well	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest it was not working	0
i dont rate the book because it is not for the class that it is in and its not fair to rate it based on that	1
they caused the problem to be fixed in the first place because the service tech failed to believe what the software said was true	0
i just made it up in my head which is very easy	1

the book that came with it did nt fit the bill it	0
a great system at an incredible price	1
i have had this camera for a long time and i nt give it up for anything	1
for the price and specs this may be the best buy out there for a large portable mp player buy it now	1
our very good friends at amazon gave this thing good marks for great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
my mom needed this computer she said so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing it home	1

loyalty is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i like the picture bright colors and very light weight i think it worked like a charm	1
the camera can be a pain but when you can instantly delete pics you do not like that are not focused properly or blurry you make it very simple and easy	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
you can manage the brightness and change the type of backlight or different type of display either list or tabbed	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
the bar is a bit of a pain	0
download directly from the xtra click on the player to open it up in a browser and you can listen to your stored mp s as they play	1
another nice thing is that the unit has a digital memory card slot but the latter was not available in the store so i d scanned before buying	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
mixed feelings i guess but the price was right	1
the size of	1
my blu ray player and i normally lean back smile and light up a smoke or two and perform a little dance	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
for the price and you can t beat the quality	1
i find it interesting	1

all other buttons are pretty sensitive too	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
size bigger than the ipod	0

this is one of the nicest phones ive ever used	1
the cloud sync feature is a feature that comes with the pc suite software	0
instead	0

very well made joints excellent black finish and finish	1
picking and creating playlists could nt be easy but its fun	1
i was able to return the product at no loss on my credit card this is amazing return policy	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
the results were as the board of directors intended	1
only if we have at least one camera in it	0
it could be better but there is nt really anything you can t do once you re in the game	0
looks like my esp w iphone docked	0
when the screen was not contracting or flickering the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
its on par with my other panasonic and jvc systems very good	1
not only is it fast and runs very fast but it is also very quiet	0
great minds	1
its so bad that it refuses to play certain episodes with no dialogue on them on the dvd	0
i have not yet met any of the people involved with this so i am very nervous	0
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
because it can help a so so many people	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from here	1
this one seems to be fine with everything else	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i was on the speakerphone for more than two hours once and the guy did not even put down one single bar	1
well this is a dvd player too	0

the more i play with it the more i love it	1
this is a little hard to understand	0
it may	1
i purchased a copy of it and they charged for usd just to look at it and said that they would refund me for the damned thing	0
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has been a challenge for me to learn	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
i ve tried to connect this machine to several different tvs using a multitude of different cables and i still can t get a good signal from the machine	0
so easy to set up had no problems with my archos	1
my first experience with it was very poor	0
it s exceptional though i can t wait to get it to the ipod	1
the buttons do get a little sticky at times and the hands free connector might be a problem	0
the one thing that keeps the music at the same level for any song will be in my pocket when i am on my holiday plane rides	0
third the poor design of the courtrooms associated with the case	0
i try to avoid it but i do not hear anything overly extreme	0
living in the city the i s and e s were nice but a bit overkill for me	1
this is especially useful if you have a camera around and you can always take the camera with you and take some pictures of your surroundings enjoy	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only had dropped signals	1
what a day	1
in terms of functions as indicated above it has a lot of power and functions for those who are serious about photography	1
all in all very easy to do	1
my wife and wd live to see me normally lean back smile and light up the room after a good firmware update and perform well forever thereafter	1
i was very disappointed that the service was unable to step me thru manual setup	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive to use	1
these guys are great	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
the more i do the more i learn	1
the sky is blue and the stars are bright and even changeable	1

i have had it for a year and it is the best player i have seen and used ever	1
highly recommended and very hard to beat at this price point	1

i think this is ok however i would like an ability to navigate by folders	1
software development	1
image clarity is lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with lrb and noticed the difference in the image	1
what is lacking in functionality is the camera as the face plate is prone to falling off	0

but if you re looking for a copy of the apex dvd player i have it	0
the interface was atrocious several elements were missing	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have no complaints and i did not think it would be	0
i tried called them but no help	0
you can see the lens barrel in the background	0
one of the reasons i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up your account thanks	0
i like how the lighting and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its easy to use if you do nt want to bother with the controls enjoy	0
to my knowledge a kbps wma file is just as good as a mp and the zen xtra file just as great as a mp player	1

last night i forgot to reset the router	0
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0

creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes working and sometimes it was not	0

these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
the more i read the more i love it	1
even after reading some of the comments it is still hard to believe but	0
this is a list	0
i will keep you posted on all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
that is a rare and valuable specimen	1
the canon camera gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has a simplicity that makes it great for the novice photographer	1
focusing on a display rack in a brightly lit room in a dark roomthe images produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
the past year has not been a good year for me at all	1
all i can say is that it dropped the ball once and i am not sure why do not know if it was something that i did or if it a result of something else anyways back to work	0
over all a very good camera which made us experience a lot on the trip	1
the internet functions of the router will only work through the router because they have a firewall that will enable you to configure the router to be used on a different network	0
even the slightest of the slightest changes distorts your image	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes it	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works well for me but many have complained that the scroll wheel itself is slow and difficult to operate	1
i like these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel i like them	1

headphones i would invest in some cool ones if it were me	0

the screen is large defined and easy to read and use	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is used over and over again the problem is battery which costs to replace	1

people were uncomfortable	0
very easy to set up	1
overall i m giving it stars as i ve had most of the problems i have repeatedly complained over but as i have only had it for a while i will be curious to see if the headphone jack hissing or other problems show	1

again the sounds were spot on and not too far from where they should be of course	1
i have had no problems what so ever with it	1
for all this music for you to listen to as well as your ipod music and music in general	1
the display is bright and clear and is sharp enough that you ll notice	1
it is also possible to switch to spot metering and get the rest of it working on the lcd screen	0
i tried navigating to a chapter past this one and it did nt do it	0
the car negotiated the speed just fine and we got to the airport with a gige link	1
on my main page the software is	0
vocals have been added for clarity with the ihome as well	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
shipping is free and they are very easy to use	1
this was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over zennix it is a great product	1
unfortunately it turned out to be the wrong type	0

this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
great phone i lufton	1
great quality of life and features	1
neither message was returned	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the sound is pretty good for a lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is some bass but i only really hear it when the volume is low in which case you cant tell you are on the lrb	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo	1
i was offline and would not connect at wireless network	0
whether you re on a hike waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the chance	1
mixed bag i guess but i like it	1
even after following some of the instructions it is still difficult to use	0
there is an alarm i may have nt heard it but it should be there	0
if nothing else this might be the best buy out there for a large memory card buy it now	1
when i take it to the doctor for my daughter is running in longer lengths than as expected even out of sequence	1
while there are some issues with the design the house gets five stars because of its affordability	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i should ve trusted all the people s comments about it	0
the settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1

the speakers have a very rich sound and they also have a not thumping bass for which you are grateful	1
like other reviewers said it was hell	0
kudos to your team your products are of superb quality your support is a testament to that	1
my opinion is optics are better and i believe optics are also better	1
the buttons on the right are small and awkward but you get used to them rather quickly	0
so why do this	0
i was able to live with the larger size but it was a struggle	0
however everything on this new router worked of course	0
i just got this new computer and there is no limit to what i can do with it	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you too	1
as a result it should feel a bit more durable	0
you are going to need to buy new headphones because these suck	0
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
nokia and t are really holding up well on this front	1
i love this player	1
these speakers are great	1
after looking at it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in my bag	1

i think i think the satellites look ugly	0
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could not restart the computer no matter how many times i rebooted my pc and reloaded it all i need is online support	0
it is well made and well worth the price	1
but within days the video output quit working	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
i am glad my hard drive did not break and i have not dropped it once	0

also the feature to be put in the song is	0
these speakers are	1
the only problem i have is the screen on my pc is stiff	0
the button on the bottom was not working properly making it difficult to select the city forecasts in my area i had to scroll too far	0
great value for money and for the price you can t beat it	1
we had two phones for the t mobile family and one was with us and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
but so far i could live with this item since it saves me from having to buy a cd case to keep my cds in the car with me now that i have one	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
recent price drops have made it one of the cheapest in digital cameras currently available	1
the unit works great with any camera for photography and is also easily worked without taking your eyes off it	1
the sound quality is pretty good well this is relative for a computer speaker anyway however once you crank the volume a little to a level a little too loud for the work i like to get done with some background noise the	0
this little camera has become a marriage between me and my family i never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
the contrast between black and white from even the most extreme viewing angles is nt great	1
it has worked flawlessly for the past year it is the perfect solution	1
i have had my laptop drive for years and i have not dropped it once	0
the quality is very good	1
this is the best i have ever seen	1
seriously this thing has so many features that a pro or expert would want	1
music in order of album shuffle etc is available on all jukebox players but it is worth noting that the zen xtra is not included in this matter	0
the easiest way to connect an external hard drive to the router is to connect when backed up from my various computers	0
i just finished my first zen xtra yesterday and i am extremely happy with it	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
i have not had time to really listen to this yet but audio and visuals on the screen are satisfactory as should be expected	1
i did not install on my personal notebook	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
portable	1
the plan is okayed	1
i especially love the fact that with it is big knob and all	1
my dad also has an apex model and it was another great value for money	1
for instance i can put all of my dvd movies in the r and r and it plays the dvds	1
color and contrast are used	1
the stock is on the cheap side	0
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
instead	0
the food is really good	1
my gut tells me that this will in the long run be at best a very portable hard drive and one on which i can t store my folders or at worst a very expensive one in which i will never want to buy products from again	0
after i had it reset it went into a state where it could never restart the device no matter how often i reset it now it is online and was working fine	1
if you have speaker cable why do this	0
the sounds were as the movie would have been	1
the screen is not backlit	0

they do look cool as hell though	0

the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more sorry	0

i also like the fact that you can create any custom playlist you want on any device not just the computer	1
i do not for the life of myself having any issues with it in the future but if i do i will know that it will be taken care of for free and quick with the help and support of the reps of amazon in	1

the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0

minor complaints are that though the music is sorted by id tag it lacks the option to search for music contained in a folder or playlist	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
the acer monitor has a large screen and its design requires the placement in an area away from a heighth or rrb that the acer will not reach	0
im no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of it by just messing around with it a bit it is easy and often obvious i think	1
the final insult is that while this app comes with useful software to make sharing easier because it is only a trial version you have to download the full version from the internet then pay an exorbitant amount to some unknown company to get	1
unfortunately the player did not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not marked as such	0
the face scan feature can be turned off easily by clicking on a button which is one of the most intuitive and intuitive controls i have ever seen or used	1

this player has worked flawlessly for me and at no cost to you	1

while i like the performance of it i will not buy another one due to the apparent indestructibility of it	1

i usually do but i do not hear anything anymore	0
i think the main thing that made the change is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
so life is good and i hope you have fun or at least for those emergency pics you have to have	1
this dvd play button	1
view this screen	1
i am giving this player cautious recommendation	1
all in all this is great	1

it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the storage capacity is huge even at kbs you can store a ton of stuff on this thing	1

the mount on it is just velcro straps to it	1
the zen file system supports data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow a file to be deleted or files to be launched from its disk	0
cheap construction they should have made it out of concrete and put some rubber on it	0
the problem is that it comes with a pitiful gb compactflash card and for most people it is not enough	0
the brightness is easy with the presets and i think that at minimum it is good for at night rrb	1

the other controls are all the same	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use the headphones instead	1

this router does crash every once in a while but not like the old router did	0

i would not recommend this product to anyone	0
and really this is the best christmas present i could have	1
be prepared for a long wait for this one but the wait was worth it	0
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
transfering is easy and the software makes everythig pretty easy	1

it seems that with this the router is	1
before i bought it for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally settled on this one and i have to say i could nt be happier and i am convinced it is the best one out there	1
i think the nomad is a myth but it is not true	0
they claim to respond in a few days but it is been weeks without reply	0
so now it still works but you just can t see it	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
the problems that come with it do not explain how to make things simple	0
when the player was injured it was not but	0
the camera had problems focusing in low light and would not focus when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released	0
anyways back to the point i ve managed to be so calm over the past month of dealing with them and their terrible service and attitude	0

other than that the game is fine and i would still watch	1
screen was good enough for me to read	1

i have no idea how much around cd is on this and have used all the available memory	1
i thought the world was going to end but it just did nt	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the sound is pretty good also but it does not sound like a real stereo speaker so there is some distortion but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own name on the screen	0
the next day i turned on my laptop and it worked but no internet connection	0
well it was fun while it lasted	1
its the size to be perfect for carrying in a backpack i think i like it	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1

the canon computer software used to download sort files and save your digital pictures on your computer is free and very easy to use	1
the canon computer software used to download and upload and save the files on the server is very nice and very easy to use	1

the quality is excellent	1
i chose the restaurant because of its reputation for very high quality clean food	1

the steering wheel is a huge improvement over the ipod touch	1

no direct firewire to the camera	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1

slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
i m not willing to spend my money on something i paid over dollars for	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
overall this camera delivers what may be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color point of view	1
i know it is a lack of experience but i found it very disappointing	0
it s all about the way it looks if it can t look at some of your real dvds	0

and it contains a lot of music and audio files	1
i found the x digital zoom to be grainy but with the file size high to begin with i think the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
i have no doubt rrb and amazon are trying to make a good quality product these random prices kills it for me i pay more than what amazon is charging for selling this router at least to me	0
sound quality may be off	0
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
if i were to put them on my listening list i wouldnt be giving but i m giving because i think they do the job that i hired them for	0

i will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
but if you have never used a slr mm then the controls are very intuitive	1
another nice feature is that it has both analog and digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature at all before now	1
both units are small with very little space	1
again the numbers are not shown and projected from where they should the center of the tv	1
again the cameras were turned on and away from where they should the rest of the time	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1

i love it	1
i am organizing my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an idea of the size of my collection this is good for about cds in terms of free memory available to me	1
but this is not mentioned in the zen manual nor in the hard copy of the book nor the cd version	0
the money which comes with player is not good enough he said its useless	0

ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the customer support team	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1

the software is simple but i found the entire process to be mastered	0
the cost of storage	1

so for all the annoyances this is a fine speaker system	0

exasperated at am i right and will be reporting this awful deceptive product to the authorities	0
i find this to be	1
now that i have all my money back there has not been any more problems	1
for the games and features it supports	1
this is pretty impressive from such rather inexperienced drivers	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
also it is waterproof and it can be placed in a container or to protect it against fire	1
as it is with the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent amount of features and features including a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on location and excellent sound quality enjoy	1
the pc sync feature is a feature that comes with nokia pc sync	0
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0

the day finally came when i was sure i would win the sprint	1
they have a wide range of devices that all have different functions	1
i only have one and that is the card game	0
this is a list	0
it is also a bit bigger than my iphone but that is only because it is easier to use with my iiphone	0
it is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just by playing around with it at a friends house it has its many uses	1
the quality is excellent	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction system	0
but this camera is better	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
this small size sound system puts out great sounds with most mp players including mp s	1
honestly i love this guy	1
i ve tried numerous different monitor models since i m a student and i ve had as poor a experience as any i ve seen	0
it didnt so i ended up posting it on here	0
another thing to note is that the unit has two usb outputs but the latter was not mentioned in the i d scanned before buying	1
both of the videos on the dvd is would repeatedly pause during the video while the counter screen kept going	0
way less expensive than	1
the fact that support and technical support are slow and nonresponsive tells you about the company and their ability to stand behind them sic	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the only thing that came from that was that little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
fortunately the metz ct has a lot of features that can be used and fortunately for me i already have a few of the highest quality external components that you can buy the mettz ct	1
good luck	1

but when we are ready to use it again there will be	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
now when the battery dies i have to replace it and it works the next day	0
bottom line is for the price they are very good and have tons of good bass	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i use than i do on my computer or at least to my ears and i rrb for less than half the cost	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a game changer for me as a visual artist and i discovered that it will also play on a regular cd r player even without vcd support	1
this is an excellent program especially for the students with talents that are able to and even excel the program	1
on the up and the phone	0
i would recommend this monitor to anyone at this price point	0
the price is less than that on other devices for a hard drive based player	0
it really impressed me with the quality of the design	1
the controls on the screen are intuitive there is no need for a manual	1
the screen is not backlit	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
portable	1
the d d dir a n wireless router works the same as a n wi fi router	0
something tells me the end result will in the long run be at best a very hard to use hard drive on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive hard drive that i invest in companies never to buy products from again	0
the second set is over just like that	0
the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
scroll down to switch	0
size extremely small and convenient will work and not break	1

this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
b it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium to load	1
only thing i can think of is no way	0
i do nt for see myself having one in the coming year or two but if i do i will be sure that it will be taken care of for me with care and attention the way that the company reps the quality of the	1

does what it should and the world is better for it	1
very easy to scroll in menu bar	1
the black fly market feels pretty cheap is it	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
storage space	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
these are the best places for the weekend cycling in london	1
it is a bit cumbersome to scroll through the list to get to the selection you want	0
second the menu system and controls are very well designed	1
so yes as with all software that comes with a gui it was useless and ugly	0
the software is not good enough and the sound has no compatibility with other sound blaster devices which is very disappointing	0
this has taught me that you ll always have to look for new opportunities as they evolve	1
the screen is large defined and bright and the ambient temperature of the room is naturally cool	1
i need this monitor	0
i did a lot of research and writing on this phone because of the small screen the fast internet and access to my corporate email	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
i did not want a job in which i would have to travel that is a pain rrb i did a lot of research and read a bunch of books and i m happy	1
d link does not seem to have support for the adapter however i was able to find a very simple driver that is compatible	0
you of course have some good other options available as well	1
hooked up to the d link and the n connected speed is down to mbps and the mbps is down down tombps	0
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
the eax app is useful at times like when you have a problem as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be helpful	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
this is an application with serious security flaws	0
the difference between the two is much greater than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
very easy to scroll in and out etc	1
this however is a completely different story and has made most of my songs sound worse than they are enjoy it	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
my only significant complaint is that	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
in short the nikon d delivers what can be considered the best of any current megapixel digicams from a detail quality contrast color balance and color response point of view	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
the speakerphone works better and faster than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
this model router has now helped me out in the short span of time ive had it	0
quite a lot of people and or the os that think this show is not ready for prime time	0
poor grip on the keys	0
changing brightness is done with four users and one user can change brightness but i leave that at minimum brightness for at night use	1
the d e extreme n wireless router works fine for me	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
having so many makes for very few transfers	1
only owned it for a year so i hope we re looking at getting rid of higher prices very soon	0
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
the bottom line is that it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to entertain its music	0
for the cost of this product i have	0
this book is definitely worth the purchase	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
my only complaint is that the cord is too short	0
i have sync which allows a one click sync between the phone and the music collection on the computer so i do not have to sync	1
this is a good place to start for music and data storage	1
we tried the finding the dvd and when we tried to watch the movie it started to freeze for no reason	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is not really robust yet so if notmad may still work	0
there is no way to know hours	0
even with the optional headset you can still listen to music over the phone enjoy	1
megapixels is good for anybody and the image quality is excellent	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
i have it for a while now and this one has been	0
i had hours of sleep and i could not connect to the internet	0
but this is not documented in the book neither the original copy nor the translation	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
while the nokia is a little behind on the features department it is well worth it for doing what it was supposed to do to be a great phone	1
i could not get on that and i could not connect to the internet	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
this was very prompt standard response	1
i tried as many of the formats to see if it worked and it did	1
creative space is not as fancy looking as windows but it is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a lot of resources	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
this product is too fragile for me	0
it also does not have voice activated dialing big minus	0
apparently they have too many employees and can t keep up with demands	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my previous router when i was using it	1
this was an old player before the video output no longer works	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the combination of the excellent sound quality compact size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
now when the backlight is on i have to leave it unplugged and it works	1
i was surprised how much fun the game was and i especially want to play it when i am bored	0
the best at an incredible price	1
the connection with my usb connection is still very quick and the battery life is very good	1
my favorite camera ever from when i can see almost everything	1
the only downside is that which requires a lot of work	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
t is which does not appear for several long stretches on the map	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
i did not managed to become a creative nomad yet	0
i think this thing is great	1
great speakers are	1
hopless product hopeless company and a lack of customer support	0
they say	1
it has a good balance of power and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound overall it is better than the quickly revised nx system	1
silverish finish really adds a special touch	1
if you want a quality product delivered to your door buy this product	1
how you can connect to more than one computer	1
it was my greatest moment in a mp camera	1
some people have complained that with the flip switch on the bottom that the player cover has not been removed and is immaterial if you remove the cover as the case may be	1
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
a few seconds later the screen freezes and eventually shows no video click here	0
its performance is much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i have had	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
the performance on the router is pretty good	1
the digital camera works great for medical photographs and the digital camera is terrific for point and shoot	1
i love my new house and its people	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
the decision making process for the nomad is slow and the interface between the two is sub par	0
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
transfer through windows explorer and save the file as an image on disk so it allows you to easily drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder on disk	1
the game is fun but if your not on top of it you lose	0
it is a bit odd in comparison to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i had no problems setting it up and now my favorite cd is transferred	1
there are also a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise produced in a car or airplane the above features are not as simple as creative has them	0
one other plus is that napster now has the ability to upload via their software	1
the grain was good	1
i only have one and that is me	0
the controls on the screen are very simple no	0
i have viewed numerous different monitor models that i own and this particular monitor had as poor of a display as any i have seen	0
tough but otherwise fine	0
dr paul is okayed	1
but then again it can be argued that i was doing it from inside my office when i was out on the street	1
this is by far the finest book in english i have ever read	1
the battery life was good and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
the movie clips taken will all have some kind of disclaimer so you can t see that	0
in fact if you re just someone that is a little bit nerdy and you just want a router to be able to surf and play mafiawars and surf myspace all at the same time this is for you	1
very good quality	1
it is light enough to carry around with you	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
but i njeh	0
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
the sound that came from the building sounded like carnegie hall	1
that is a rare and valuable specimen	1
the speakers with the subwoofer know how to go all the way down but it is difficult because these are computer speakers there is s and s and w and it still sounds unnatural to me	0
no one has a power adapter for lrb or what ever stupid name it is rrb power adapter	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
what about the dvr what if it can t play some of your favorite dvds	0
but it seems to be working so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems in the future	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it also has trouble playing mp s	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i have this connected to my pc with a pro and it works flawlessly	1
only if we have at least one camera in it	0
now that i have looked back on it there has never been anything	1
by cocking the shutter button and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to capture the scene contrary to what other people had done	1
the technical support phone line was not working for my giving technical support calls	0
samsung says it is the most affordable camera on the market	1
i did not have to be a creative nomad explorer to work	0
this was an awesome player before the video was no longer available	0
this camera is amazing and i highly recommend it	1

and it it is woth every man	1
my only concern is that it happened more than once and i am not sure why do i not know if it was a virus or if it is a malfunction of the router	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you travel and you can always take the camera with you and use it in emergencies	1
good battery life	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
cards for example are available on amazon but not on this player	0

i have to say i m a little disappointed by the user interface for playing cd rs dvds that are stored on cd rsdvds	0

nikon i mbrojtjes is one of the best out there for the features and price	1

it was very easy to set up and my ps asus netbook and my netbook netbook all connect without issue	1

after reading this i have to say that this guy takes incredible pictures	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players out there that can play just about anything you throw at it	1
overall an excellent game	1
while there are flaws with the device the device is attractive because of its affordability	1
apple has a new player that blows the pod away with easy to use and understand software that is fast and easy to install read more	1

the app which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
they do look cool in it though	0
does not recognize player at all times despite being connected and knows he is there	0
there are two of them which i like because that is where my thumb is when i am typing enjoy	1

the scroll bar is empty	0
so now it has everything you just can t have	0
i do not know what other people are doing but the software is not working	0
there is no speaker grill to give the audio to the driver	0
i definatley recommend this system and its volume can be used in a small house for such a small speaker system	1

the technical support support line was very helpful for my project technical support stars	1
i think i think the satellites look ugly	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself because it has been getting good reviews as a good value for the money on amazon	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
i was surprised to find that not only did this program allow me to play mpeg files which allowed me to stack them but it also was able to play my own files which i created with smart ripper	1
lrb lost its connection but internet service was restored when it was connected back to the internet rrb	0

what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to be working	0
the software i use is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than they are	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
i think i mentioned it the other day but the headphone craze just sort of fizzled out	0
they said the problem was the wrong product in the box the next day the tech industry started to believe what the experts said was wrong	0
i am using it as a left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker system	1

the functionality of this app is mind blowing	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1

bottom line well made camera that is able to use very flexible and versatile features to enhance the ability to use lens and lense filters choices	1
finally the tracks downloaded from the computer can be found because the tracks are listed individually and are sorted alphabetically by track number which are not the same but are organized in alphabetical order	0
this is easy and it makes everythig pretty easy	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
sound quality is good	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0

the hands free app is quite powerful	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
when you are in it you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and yet so big	1

the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
please note that the scroll bar is not always responsive	0

i am around to watch non american region dvd is i am around is hidden features i am hidden features	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
i think this is the best dvd player you can buy	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused it to sometimes not turn on	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
bottom line great product unbeatable value	1
wo man i play a lot of discs	0
the nice thing is that the unit has both analog and digital audio outputs but the latter was not mentioned in the literature on the unit	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i hope you like it	1

i also recommend this to anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and is willing to pay next to nothing i have no regrets and i recommend thisto anyone who want to over commit	1
i bought this one because i thought it was the best one for the money	1
i just read this and i think this is the best idea i ever had	1
fact is it could also be easier to do	1
besides i think i prefer widescreen monitors	1
however its the optical zoom that is what i go for of the shots that i take	1
seemed like a good deal but it frequently can not be done takes a long time to do and then concludes no good	0
the screen is very easy to read and it is bright enough to read but not too bright so it does nt blind you when you are reading	1
buy the device only buy the data you need for the device if the device is not a convenient data center	0
i find all of this very interesting and not flimsy in the least	1
also very light and fluffy	1
this is a great camera for you	1
the speakerphone the radio all features are available	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
only one complaint is that you can only use the speakerphone feature once the person you are talking to is on the phone not while it is	0

i did not know how to make the explorer to work	0
all and all i am grateful	1
it is light and easy to carry around without bother	1

great phone	1
the windows installer is good lrb do it right and user friendly	1

the results were both good	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at some times and not sensitive enough at others	0
i love the fact that i can put it in my pocket or purse and forget about it	1
its a great camera and for the price you get buy	1
its also obviously not the bass for which you might need it it does have a very rich sound and good dynamics	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
the quality of firmware itself is a big deal and suggests that this company is just getting started	1
there is much which has been said in the past about the samsung galaxy s it is a great phone and worked well for me out of the box	1
p it was so sad i definately recommend it to anyone	1
the black fly wheel feels so cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the interface was atrocious and some elements just did not work at all	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
after a while it starts to look like the dvd is are dirty	0
it is still overall bigger than the others but it is possible that this is because of less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology	1
this one won me over and the best part was the size it fits right into any pocket without falling out	1
but i have already been creative enough about it and gotten some responses they will fix it for me if i want	1
i think this is relative great for the price but once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too loud for what i like to listen to the audio is a bit lrb	0
it is a very expensive gadget do not expect high definition sound	0
i was very unhappy with some of the properties but now that i have the equalizer settings and the fact i have to open up the menu every time i switch between movies and tv shows or games it is much more bearable	0
i have no idea about lebovitz but i was able to figure out it just by playing around with it at a camera store i think its cool i hope	1
the second video was released about two weeks before the video came out	0
it does nt have firewire not on it since they do nt seem to have firewires themselves	0

the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
it is excellent as one would suspect from the title the guardian	1
i am sure it works and can be useful in a lot of situations where you would only want it to be at a whisper	1
it is small but big value for money	1
also you can store it online which is great for those who dont want to go just to buy if you have an account do not bother this is a much better buy	1
mediasource did not work on my personal notebook	0

i do nt mind having an hd antenna but it is expensive and it is on the bottom floor of the house	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1

the balance and balance seem to be better in the horizontal position	0
while i am using it instead of i am calling it a because it has worked well for me during the time i have used it	1

and it looks great too	1
as soon as i was able to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot i	1

the case is very interesting and interesting but unfortunately lacks a conclusion	0
the guns muzzle velocity range is also adjustable so you can blast it if you want	0
i am delighted with this product	1

pictures taken in the past are a little dull and boring if you tend to use photographs from the past	0
my other big complaint about this is the stand	0
i checked out the amazon site and i m happy to say it worked works fine right out of the box	1
equipment included is average but that is what you get and that s not what you want	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
it allows the usb interface to be used either for writing or editing	1
color and texture are perfect for my taste	1
this little camera has created a bond between myself and nikon that i never thought i could love a digital camera so much	1
bottom line i have a better sound system in my house than i had on my old lrb at least to my ears and for less than half the cost	1
they sound great in my head and i have not even touched any of them	1

i think it is a little more expensive than the ipod but not by much i like it	0
it is simple and it worked well out of the box thanks	1

i thought this is support number but it just kept ringing	0

i am ncercat	0
her work is phenomenal	1

speakerphone loud and clear has a lot of features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
i thought the e s and f s were nice but a bit overkill for what i was doing im in love	1
i was hoping that it would download the files but there is no difference in what i did with the files	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a music player which allows me to easily play music wherever i go and has is combination of functions and features easily accessible	1
you can help to tell with a quick google search thanks	1

get it it is woth every penny	1
the benefits that come with it are nt that great	1

a great investment	1
i find this to be very interesting	1
the sound quality is really good	1
i tried calling the support number for a week and a half and every time i got a busy signal	0

the best way to make things easy to see and the best way is big enough for people to see	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of a rep who does not seem to be available their email and telephone number is the same as the one above the customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the system is also very flexible	1
surfing with you on it is nice as well i just wish there was more	1
the button is small and difficult to press	0
view this screen	1
having usb ports allows for very fast transfers	1

i have had it for a while now and i am happy	1
bright visible light	1
feedback on creative is poor feedback is universally poor this is not just limited to creative it applies to all the company	0

it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
this was my first nonflip flop and i am so glad i decided to go with them	1
after i rebooted my pc it got into a state where it would not restart the device no matter how often my pc reset the device it is online but was no help at all	0

best camera ever from the image quality to the function i can say that	1
it has good color and price was great	1
bass fanatics look forward	1
the weather is nice	1
proven canon errors	0
software development	1
so thats what i did and i recommend this to anyone who wants it also anyone else who wants a harddrive based cd player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
the only minor issues i have with the camera are the lens and the lens itself	0
software the software industry	1
too difficult to find a genre album track list for large number of tracks	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from youtube com	1

as i mentioned the user interface of the app is average however not difficult to use or horrible	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
the best thing about the nomad is the eax	1
my two main requirements were a better quality of life and lower price i found both	1
i like the idea of a key lock function	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
they are not designed and intended to be used interchangeably with a sub	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the screen is large enough and the resolution is sharp enough that you ll never have to worry about workspace issues	1
my only significant complaint is	0
i have viewed numerous different monitor models because i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of a battery life	0
a well made camera that is able to use very fast and powerful features to improve the image ability to use external flash and lense lens choices	1
i chose this store because of its reputation for very high quality clean products	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
if you do nt search it will lump all your files together and they can not be searched as the file does not exist	0
second gripe in the or so months since we moved into our house none of of these things have ever been solved	0
very long battery lifevery short battery life	0
pictures wo can be transferred to your computer directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
and then i had to work to get it on youtube because i had the actual chinese version of the songs as the video	0
when the player says it is but	0
the catch with the digital camera is that it will cause you to lose precious time	0
this person is not perfect and is not a perfect person with one or two good qualities	1
had a dog that was years old and i lost him but the onkyo dog is still alive	1
overall i m happy with this update as i ve seen some of the problems i have repeatedly encountered but as i have only had the player for a week i leave room for doubt if the new jack will work or if it will catch	1
after much searching i finally found the link to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrst is website and it is here	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
mediasource is a web browser with serious user interface flaws	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
this is the best phone i have ever used	1
the replacable battery is very cheap and once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy a replacement	0
wow this speaker really works	1
they are clears and ready to be loaded into the ship along with a sub	0
office starter web cam is also fairly cheap but in terms of the pros and the cons i wo not say much as you are just paying for this net book	0
the scene mode works really well for the types of scenes that are not meant to be in a static setting	1
other than that this thing is awesome	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
the first set i received had a loud audible noise coming from the speakers and had to be turned off	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
while the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a mp player to result in a good experience enjoy	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
this is a bad device and customer will run like hell from this product	0
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
unfortunately after loading this all i can see now is that its either not connected or disabled	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
at ounces it is a bit heavier but not as heavy as the ipod	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and could not be played	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
with gb of storage i have about songs i want to share with you for about more	1
it does not have a camera but it does let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with you here about that	0
range of functions as shown above it has basic functions for everyone to use and shoot and advanced functions for those who are serious shooters	1
it works better on a band than the linksys	1
i enthusiastically agree	1
it makes up for this by being very easy to use with little that can be learned from it	1
i love my new house and its people	1
it took me a while to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player interface enjoy	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the camera is equipped with a touchscreen for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to scroll through menu options to do so	1
fm receiver it has none	0
i found it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for i	1
