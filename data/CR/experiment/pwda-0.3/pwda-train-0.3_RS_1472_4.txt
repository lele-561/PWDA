would i strongly recommend this product	1
move will the feature rrb monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt it only	0
the sound quality is fantastic and to is of really great carry this around instead it stacks of cd is or tapes	1

over some inherent benefit feel that priced speakers do lastly unless for what i got lrb the there is i know that i were nt in the bose label of rrb	1
i ve the headphone jack this thing has already come loose and had just over a month	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1

also the display is hinged and a myriad be placed in it to of positions or it protect can against any damage	1
excellent is audio	1

the is ihome stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
for the first few expected this player was with i player it to weeks an affordable be everything dvd multi format a stylish slim case as advertised	1
am i bored with the silver look	0
image is immediately great and i with a photoshop of work in lot do mb raw image files lrb noticed the difference clarity rrb	1
the fact mpeg files this model would play jpeg slideshows was discovered big by accident for me a a visual artist and i data disk that that will play without on it regular cd r a plus as vcd formatting	1

is makes these focus i lag time at lock the can with live the extreme depth of field obtainable with what point and shoot digicams something f	1
i like the nomad is color better it is not terribly flashy but	1
go you are not if picky image quality about for it	0
the pc side software as bad to it a getting little used and can be goofy takes is not but as some reviewers have indicated	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
of this one is the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
great color display for my desk and just the right sharp picture size	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
nt have tried many times is get a hold number customer who telephone i seem to answer their emails and extremely of is does as the to probably apex service rep one lonely constantly busy overworked	0
on battery the up side has amazing the phone life	1
like can be made for without you shuffle and repeat selections and aid of use play modes on the fly can playlists your now playing a computer or playlists	1
to like programming and exposure control provide you latitude excellent photos be creative slr its progam and auto settings if gives yet exposure you do nt want to bother with the settings	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
cheap construction player have put made the should out of hard plastic and they some rubber on the corners	0
sometimes the would would hang system i so have router then the to restart get going again	0
they not are wowable good	0

you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0

the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
i know replacement unit will have problems is totally ridiculous creative the for the year and in the future this will warranty asked worth it since be will only warrant it for days which in itself no questions	0
price	1
