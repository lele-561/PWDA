with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
in the market yes the picture quality and features which are too the features numerous to mention are unmatched but the features for any camera in this price range	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0

it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1

up with all your music as it stands now the case is going to load it pretty useless unless you re games if packing the player up is right for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
i think one of the reasons the real reason that made the changes is that think that it now this game is making uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it of a difference does nt the volume to be loud enough make that big in the background but i find set the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it of a difference does nt the volume be loud enough make that big in the background but i find of a disturbanc of a disturbance	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0

by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
