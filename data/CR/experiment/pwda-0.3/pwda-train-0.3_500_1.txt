this product is amazing	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
quite bulky and a heavy battery not very solid as contructed of plastic	0
it really helped me with the disign the specs the first time	1

portable	1
it is to use and easy enough not big for my grandmother to use	0
we just got it and it was brand new perfect condition as can be expected but keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion may differ to a lot of people	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
also the carrying case that came with mine up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have open to see the display	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1

typically the only thing missing is the headphone jack it was for me and my wife	0
even nt you do have better to worry batteries constantly replacing about	1

sub woofer the is large	1
the bass sound the is crystal clear the midrange and the bass is very deep as well	1
screen  brightness is really good	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0

the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
price of storage gb	1
great features	1
screen brightness is really good	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
what really made this great and a mediocre really mp made player for me was the software	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
they clears and perfect to be	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0

others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
the player has the option which will decide the outcome if there are any	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
it is a the one play and that you have to go of my favourite games but it is a shame that it is so little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
there are limitations what you do of the built in speaker crossovers	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple contained a pdf of instructions and had needed to download the software directly from the website offered nothing by downloading the software from th users indicated i should load the cd rom but  it turns out it it only should load the cd rom but it turns out it it only contained a pdf of instructions and had needed to download the software from the apple website offered nothing b way of explanation on installing for appl contained a pdf of instructions and had needed to download the software from the apple website offered nothing by  downloading the software from the apple website for users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it it only contained a pdf of instructions and had needed to download the software directly from the website offered nothing b way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1

but this one is great	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little but it is not bad as some reviewers have	0
no propietary headset jack	0
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
i could tell this was as soon as i set it up	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
cheap and they should have made it out of hard plastic and put it on the wall	0
the software sucks	0
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
is phenomenal this router	1
in this case it is not a convenient data storage device only but the one you need for your music collection	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
it has a few problems one is that the buttons do not automatically play music like on a keyboard	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
this phone has would like to mention many other features ir a few but these are the ones just to name one the features above i view as the a lot of features i could list most beneficial	1

while not as sleek and elegant as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is a great alternative to a good cddb service it is also free	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
it is free and it is feature complete	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1

the canon computer software used to download and upload and save the files on the server is very nice and very easy to use	1
is worth any price recommend you do nt purchase it	1
i m m delighted with this product	1
living in a small college apartment the e and e were a bit for what needed	1
very long lasting battery life	1
having access to so much music a good time where ever you are in the world go is terrific	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
well theory the working but enabling upon the guest network things stopped was great	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
it is easy enough to listening to are currently pop it open to you are listening to and what are currently see what song you re listening to	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1

just a crude pictorial instruction have been disappointed there of installation that to is i no printed instructions with it find which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the bad news is that it comes with a price tag and for most purposes it is not enough	0
the scene mode works only for a subset of shots that are not related to the scene	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the sound level is still not as high as i would like	0
excellent range of products of metering options as well	1
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and high prices this deal seemed heaven sent	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and they also have a not thumping bass for which you are grateful	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it been around mb s even when	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
i have and to the manual relatively clear all of are well thought out shutter priority aperature is light metering adjustments etc but all controls try yet the adjustment options and priority using	0
great camera	1
as i said before the creative mediasource is actually really robust compared to what others have done though i think it could still work better	1

when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
great price	1
i ve had ve never used it way before this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
awesome other people that complain about this player it this are talking bull is just because player breaks fast which is horrible	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1

the manual that does filling in any blanks a fine job remain	1
it been has a nice color screen	1

what i do nt like is that at the end of the music listening tonal qualities change	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0

when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1

lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
he was fast and they are very quick to pick him up	1
loved the slim design	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0

although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding while signed to do and what it is today although there is still a lot of hardware work to do i commend the netboo designed to do and what it was piece of hardware work to do i commend the nokia for doing what it originally was primarily meant to do to be for doing what it  originally was primarily  meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1

the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
fragile	0
well it had good feel or power but feel no speed and accuracy precision at all	1
when where saw a lot of plastic not concerned was metal i was be as good that there would i the sound	1
the think acceleration real reason that made the changes is i it now that gpu hardware uses	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0

even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0

it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
and of versatile it one to be seems is the best	1

you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the first routers for years	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1

this phone is features great the best but it is better than as a whole good and wise it is good is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1

these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
image clarity is great and i do a lot of work in my studio with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
