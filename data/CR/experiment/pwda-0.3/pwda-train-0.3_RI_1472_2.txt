even better you the do nt worry have to worry about constantly replacing if the battery dies batteries	1
the sound is surprising to say the least full with a fair amount of bass even and a good amount of treble for such  a small unit	1
the top at the touch that covered the battery kept poping the battery on and off without much of a touch of a button and near the bottom latch	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
anything how well this phone does it does perfectly	1

and a little too big back of your hand the buttons the buttons will get on the right side of the screen on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1

the close to the size of the screen screen may be still looks great a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt is a good thing it come in the overused blue	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across you will find that suit you the house  are your requirements then speed this router a large area of will do the job	1
