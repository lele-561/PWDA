nothing but hassle with this company	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and great camera	1
it has good color and price was great	1
great quality picture and features	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
it easily fits in a backpack and it is not heavy	1
but the sound quality is excellent and works well on my portable speakers	1
i had no problems setting up my account and now my favorite cd is here	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
the combination of the price storage and performance makes this one of the best on the market	1
they were both good	1
great camera	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1

it looks great and is easy to use	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
even viewed cds full length	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
very easy to set up	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
i get home and everything freezes	1
easy to use a lot of reviews and comments	1
this is my life and what a life it is	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1

why the moon is red and is so attractive	1

the build quality is top notch	1
nt nt a lot of discsa lot of disc a lot	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
but canon never ceases to amaze	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the appearance is okayed	1
the angles ca nt be beat the view from even the best of angles	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
this is a piece speaker system and it is	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
so now it all plays out you just can t see it	0

great picturesgreat picture and features	1
featured image	1
i can get off easily but i always have my phone in the car so i did nt do it	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the good news is that the fastest speed at which it has connected to it has been mb s even when in the same room	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
i think the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
the software i use is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than they are	0
if you do not have tags it will lump all of your tracks into one folder and they can not be moved to another folder or folder as the zen does not recognize folders	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and changing the settings back to manual i was able to produce a picture similar to what other reviewers have described	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0

it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
in addition it comes with the following	1
it is not	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses apps that are designed to help you find your songs	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its amazing how much can be done in a small house for such a small budget	1
great minds	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
i have excellent hearing but the sound level on my phone is especially quiet	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1

creative labs customer support website is useless	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at some times and not sensitive enough at others	0

bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
software the software is crap	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera is the best part of it	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
these speakers are	1
no direct access to the camera	0
takes excellent photos	1
the colors are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames but with really long names you have to cycle through them before you can get back to normal size	0
its out of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
the eax i had did not do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited upgrade	0
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1

after we got the problems we tried to contact them but we never got any response as the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their calls customer support	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
i selected the right one and have gotten it right every time	1
on the other hand indoor shots with a tripod are not quite as good as outdoors	0
i can t rate it higher only because when it is good it is great	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
this phone has a lot of features just to the ones i view as the most beneficial	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
the woofer is much larger	1
i am ncercat	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
i d like to tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to be fixed so i never got far enough to do this	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1

creative labs customer support website is useless	0
the second set is working just fine	1
price gb of storage	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
its fine	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very close to the ground	0
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
this is a winner	1
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
you will see desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach files there is also a usb upgrade that allows all the usb drives to be stored in the actual computer	1
for the price and if you can t afford the price	1
my first impression was positive	1
get it it now	1
it does not only have a name it even has a	0
it is better than the s	1
despite me giving kudos to the app for music streaming i experienced a flaw using the app	0

the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
deficiencies with zennx are not the same as with rd party earphones and software	0

this phone is a great little phone its got great features a great screen size and battery life	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the paint runs through the whole giving it a very clean look	1

newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
the quality of the range is what you might expect from a this size lrb perhaps even better than expected at this price the colours are nice no question about it the build is good too	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0

it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1

also the feature to be put in the song is	0
as i mentioned the user interface of the app is average however not difficult to use or horrible	0
the day finally came when i was sure i d beiposted by	0
you will find the full auto setting will take them right out of the game enjoy	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
i will nt go into too much detail here as others go into great depth in their reviews but i am very impressed with the features the system has the flexibility the automation and the features this system offers	1

the fm radio is a radio station	1
it works and looks great if you can get the hang of how easy it is to play	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
what makes the focus lock work and something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these lenses and the fact that at f	1
these are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
navigation could help but there is nt really much you can t do once you ve gotten the hang of it	0
the controls are a bit inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
based on the price and specs this might be the best option out there for a portable memory mp player	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i have gb out of space in that space i loaded my whole collection of music which is nt that many songs and i	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
after the release of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1

definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
it also has a web app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts the data into english	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
overall i like it	1
while buying the phone i was tempted to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
highly recommend getting the book and reading it	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
but too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to switch among city lights he said i had a panic	0
it played only one out of three times which is without a hitch with the other two being plagued by a number of glitches	0

the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
the future is good	1
if you are not sure about it just go for it	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and should be enough to satisfy those who do not have money to spend on computer speakers	0
do nt buy a car	0
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
just bought this camera two days ago and already love the camera and the features it has	1
great price for all the essentials	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
the screen is bright enough to read but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you look too long it is very easy to read and read	1
no matter the format	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
it is slow supposedly it is slow	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the customer support team	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
so go ahead and brag to your friends who are looking for a dvd player that can t do half the things ours can and for a fraction of the price	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1

the remote control but then it dies and you are left standing there wondering what you are doing with your life	0
the weather is nice	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
both of the videos on the dvd is would repeatedly pause during the video while the counter screen kept going	0
best group of support i have ever experienced	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
now when all else fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
the problem is that the headphone jack is unique to the iphone so standard headphones will not work	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
your results are average so just use your regular method thanks	1
when i take it to the doctor for my daughter is running in longer lengths than as expected even out of sequence	1

it may	1
the service from the supplier was discontinued	0
as soon as i was able to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot i	1
with my sennheiser headphones the sound is loud enough at	1
well this is a dvd player too	0
while i am satisfied with the performance of the phone in every regard i would not buy another phone solely on the apparent indestructibility of it	1
no changes to the format	0
does what it should and thats what matters to me	1
and it is	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and vivid	1
it may	1
video output stopped here	0
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
what really made this work for me was the software	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
i like it a lot but it is not terribly flashy	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
i dont rate the book because it is not for the class that it is in and its not fair to rate it based on that	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
however everything on this new router worked of course	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
it is easy and i found that syncing files from my phone to the computer was easy too https www google com store apps details id https a fandroid com	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
and i love a good bass and as such i love this bass with a sweet jbl sub	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
bottom line is for all of these things to work and have tons of good bass	1
i am using them in my office and they generally work well	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
your health is fine	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
great price for all the features	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
not only is it functional and useful but it is	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
overall i lira	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable as well	1
i love you	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
you can do other different things with it such as changing what you think of now to something else you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the up to few months i have had it	1
it sounds great in the kitchen or on my coffee stand	1
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
i have a computer and there is no limit to what i can do with it	1
i ve tried to connect this machine to several different tvs using a multitude of different cables and i still can t get a good signal from the machine	0
the software mediasource can not work properly	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
it had a heavier and heavier weight	0
the monitors were both good	1
sound quality is good	1
i have had this phone for just over a month and the headphone jack has yet to come off	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
so if you are just someone that is a little scared of technology and you just need a router to get online do you want to sit and watch netflix and play games all day this router is for you	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
the function lever the one which switches between view mode and view mode is fragile	0
i did a ton of research and fell in love on this phone because of the price the great voice calling plan and easy access to my corporate email	1
if you re taking your dog for a walk or just having lunch at the park you might be wishing you had the fm radio	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
i expect these stocks to underperform and for them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
the system is terrific in my opinion and is looking better than the competition	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
it has everything one would need in a home	1
you can blame the people at customer support or the tech support technicians for that because i gave them all the information i could	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with simple controls that can be adjusted	1
it is easy and often obvious i think but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera level thanks to its many creators	1
very long lasting battery life	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
it is worth it	1
it is small enough to fit in my canon slr so it fits in my pocket	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
no it has none	0
the speakers are small with similarly small speakers	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the operation of the netbook was done with the windows home professional instaled the other netbooks with windows starter kit and nobody noticed this	0
they had a pretty comfortable stay in place and were	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
what is a great advantage over the ipod is the price which costs to buy it is	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
playing music while leaving it on produces crystal clear playback	1
this is a little hard to understand	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
its a great opportunity for a lot of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
it has been	1
second the payment system and the system are poorly designed	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
battery life very long battery recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen size and resolution price	0
overall i like the game	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
trouble when trying to get service online	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from here	1
it is more powerful than its predecessor and packed with even more features	1
you can stop here this is the wifi n router you are using i am writing this on my laptop	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
there are lots of stink and you can nt download them you have to get the link directly to them thanks	0
the sound quality is great i do not have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i would change is voice dialing it is a great phone	0
i did not know a thing about how to operate it it was so confusing	0
when it works its great but i have to go through two monitors now both of them	0
i love the fact that i can wear it in my shirt or pants and not worry about it	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
and the sound well there is no doubt	1
when you turn on your tv it turns on automatically and it continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
we own one of these lrb black boots and i am very happy with the quality of the boots especially at what these sell for here on amazon	1
i hope this does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	0
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
as a whole the dvd player has been tested and works fine	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
however the sound of the player is pretty good once you get used to it enjoy	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
what a sweet machine	1
worked fine	1
the size is small	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
you can be miles away from it and it will still be there	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
also the design of the design is flawed	0
this is the best phone i have ever used	1
i immediately had to turn on the player to watch two of my favorite dvds	0
i downloaded the cd rom but it turns out it only contained apple music and there was nothing else on it for apple users however the instructions for apple user indicated i should download it	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
dr paul is okayed	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
what i do nt like is that at the end of the day the listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
the headphones are pretty good but you can never expect much out of them unless you put them in the ear cavity	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
this is software that is easy to understand and use and a great value this is a great player that blows you away with easy to use and understand software	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the difference between the two is much greater than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
many of our disney movies do not play on this dvd player	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
it was great but upon enabling the guest network it stopped working	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
it is gb of free space	1
have tried to do so but it is not valid	0
so i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they can be a little expensive but since i dont	0
i like the battery well and it has a good lifespan	1
the iphone plus is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
small print	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a music player which allows me to easily play music wherever i go and has is combination of functions and features easily accessible	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with you here about that	0
it is versatile and easy to be used	1
it has a few advantages one is that they do not have to play one after another game	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
this router is phenomenal	1
key instead	0
i would strongly recommend this product	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
the other controls are all the same	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
volume level is	1
no dropouts and good signal strength all over my three story house unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and operation	1
it is not for beginners to use but has features that most people will find useful so it is an excellent tool to get into	1
be prepared for a long wait for this one but the wait was worth it	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
it feels somewhat clunky and has an awkward tiny little cut out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the screen its	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
but i think it is perfect	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
it sucks	0
i purchased three of these books at very reasonable prices from amazon we are extremely happy with them	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and the memory is so small it is not enough	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the door would not close	0
the zen file system supports data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow a file to be deleted or files to be launched from its disk	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
unfortunately i bought a new one because the ps could nt work and now the ps can t work	0
it did not seem to have a strong new smell for me	0
you can see the lens of the camera in the view finder	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south america and it is amazing	1
these are the best bike rentals for the weekend in the park	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
the screen is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for some it is not for everyone people say they have a low rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
good luck	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
as i see it this is actually really good despite what others have said and notmad may actually work better	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
i dont know but less than a month is not an acceptible amount of time for something like this	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
my first impression was good	1
video output stopped workin	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
one other thing to note is that napster now lets you via their software	0
tech support from apex court	1
then sorting the rest of the data is easy as pie	1
the customer support is very rude	0
its weight and much more which might not seem to matter much if you dont carry or keep it in your pocket	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
the case is very interesting and interesting but unfortunately lacks a conclusion	0
progressive scan player for android	1
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
however i was able to overlook those things as this unit is very powerful and has a myriad of features	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it has a nice color screen	1
the quality is excellent	1
i lrb what i had to do with it it works and i do nt have to close my eyes and think when i am trying to do something on the computer	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
simple and easy to use back buttons volume and power are very easy to read access and use	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the price range is great so you can afford it if you want	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not be as good as typical american phones	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
it is a bit odd in comparison to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
creating this video using iptables to create was not as easy as i would have liked	0
do nt buy this player	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
pictures wo nt transfer directly to your computer from the camera via the included transfer cable	0
the manual is easy to read and it is very readable	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
the picture is perfect but i am not watching on an hdtv	0
these along with the replaceable battery were the main driving factors on why i picked the nomad	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the quality of the lcd screen is great	1
after reading this i have to say that this guy takes incredible pictures	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
sub woofer is large	1
the woofer is much larger	1
and it turns out to be the disposable type	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
i have been able to shoot using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature and light metering are not working but all controls are easy to figure out and and the menu is relatively clear	1
very easy to set up	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever seen	1
the dvd player is fine	1
for me its very important and writing code for games and word docs is more than enough	1
portable	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the catch with the canon g is that its not something you will use if you die	0
storage capacity	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
the lack of capacity is great for me	0
but anyway the only thing you should be looking at here is the fact that the world does have a future	1
the only complaint i have is that when you want to select you cant or it wont work	0
it really helped me with the disign the other day	1
it is easy for you to pop it up to see what song you re listening to	1
this is probably one of my favorite games because it can handle almost everything you throw at it	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
i got it because it works great for its price and while i understand that it is for iphone and there are some things that should be done at the right measures to make it work so i do nt blame it for	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon from around the rrb and on friday the monitor was at my door and by the next day i had it	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
for those who dont know the fact that this is capable of doing something very good for a small amount of rrb this is probably necessary	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
picture quality is excellent	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the included earpiece is small and lightweight	0
at ounces it is very light but not as light as	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd play files which allowed me to stack files on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i had never seen	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very small amount of contrast in the screen to get consistent contrast	1
one of the reasons i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up your account thanks	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
this dvd play button	1
the woofer is large	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
its like when you ask for a compliment and it does nt come as it should straight out of the mouth	1
playlists can be created on the fly without aid of a computer and you can even set up automatic playlists like shuffle and repeat for your now playing tracks or playlists	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
the quality of the pictures are very good and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject the quality is excellent	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
the setup process for the game is infuriating and the interaction with the player is frustrating	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
it was easy to unbox and install	0
this zen book has everything that the i book has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this book buy it now	1
very long battery lifevery short battery life	0
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
the camera comes with a manual and the very best camera app which has optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
there are other types such as eax and customization	0
overall an excellent phone	1
key words	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
it is harder than i thought but as it turns out so much of the better	1
software the software industry	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
i would like to apologize because the clip is nt secure and the case can be hacked but i do apologize	0
the keys are laid out so there is no confusion	1
i love it	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am very happy with the purchase	1
with gb of storage i have about songs i have with me for now	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
as a result it should feel a bit more durable	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the cost of storage	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the auto industry does well most of the time but there are still problems for those who choose to ignore them	1
the sound quality is very good	1
i m not very sure what to do with this machine or acer	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
they do look cool in it though	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
not only the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but it also enables you to charge the camera while plugged in to the charger the camera has a different kind of battery charging system from others	1
the main software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does not work well under load on some computers	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
material is on the cheap	0
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen went blank	0
i bought this book opened it up and was not impressed	0
it was from to at which the system failed completely	0
the router failed and the lrb went dead on me when i tried to work from home due to heavy snow	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
it has a lot of little cute features such as being the camera and the pim and the radio	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
it didnt work so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i do like this book overall but i i i	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
the zen xtra is a great album with good sound and well recored mp s	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
ripping it off and creating will nt be any easier	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
the quality is superb	1
i reiterate my down rating for t mobile as a stock	0
the quality is excellent	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
the build quality is top notch	1
the screen is blurry but if you click you should be able to make it out	1
mediasource did not work on my personal notebook	0
exasperated at am i right and will be reporting this awful deceptive product to the authorities	0
it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to sit in its place this is why it sucks	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
i have not even started my new job yet and already i am disapointed	0
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
what worries me is the fact that it does not work	0
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
the explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as a file so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from one location to another browse through them here	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
