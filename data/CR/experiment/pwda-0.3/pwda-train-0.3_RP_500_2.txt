ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1

cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
i bought it for my birthday and i am very happy with it	1
they are uncoordinated and have no sense balance wise or handling skills	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1

i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
this article is based on autofocussing in auto mode with auto mode which can t be stopped	0
it looked just right	1
the screen is bigger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue colour which makes the screen more readable than the nk the screen is	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1

the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and great camera	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
i chose this store because of its reputation for very high quality clean products	1
customer service and technical support that are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their ability to support them	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
but i do love audio sync which gives me a one click connection between my phone and the music collection on the computer thanks	1
these are the best places for the weekend cycling in london	1

but this is not documented in the book neither the original copy nor the translation	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker with great sound quality and respectable bass	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the old browser page not showing up on screen replaced most of the page this is a bug	0
i thought it was decent but it was too complicated to enjoy at all	1
i am able to see it from a distance in places where shadows are not so easily concealed	1
easy to hook up	1

the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0

this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
it is very good i use it every day and i have to use it for hours or days at a time	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see it and if the button did not bring up the screen	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
in this case it is not a convenient data storage device only but the one you need for your music collection	0
i tried accessing and editing the files to find it to be empty	0
i love this book and am extremely happy with my purchase	1

uploading the images to my windows image server is very fast and simple	1
the hands free app is quite powerful	1
this book is well worth the purchase	1
my first impression was positive	1
the setup system for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is terrible	0
i found the x digital zoom to be grainy but with the file size high to begin with i think the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
its smaller and much larger which is not good to have if you use it while running or walking	0
the link is broken and can not work on my pc	0
another nice feature is that it has both analog and digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature at all before now	1
the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0

this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the world is small	1
despite most people giving a thumbs up to the zen for music quality i found a flaw using eax	0
mixed bag i guess but i like it	1
i get home and everything freezes	1

it also costs less than the ipod	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
i love this monitor	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
he has been a great performer for me	1
also it was only with a discount and no tax so it was cheaper	0
i do not for one moment see myself having a child in the next year or two but if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service	1
sometimes i find it hard to judge if i am truly gripping it and holding it by my hand alone	1
the scroll wheel is simple and easy to use however some have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
but this is not mentioned in the zen manual nor in the hard copy of the book nor the cd version	0
the sounds were as the music directors wanted them	1
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
great price	1
the device is small and easy to use i would recomment it highly	0
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
so far i have no complaints and i would recommend this to anyone who wants comfort over appearance also anyone who has a pet and wants to sleep next to them	0
it seems that with every firmware release it gets worse	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
i bought it on a friday afternoon lrb around pm and the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i think i have two subs in there that should help you enough if i am not the bass player	0
mp x optical zoom takes great photos with detail that challenges all of the above and makes the cameras easy to understand and use it has a lot of features and is equipped with great software and hardware but last but not least my fiance	1
it is small	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone number but they are nt responding to my emails and their phone line is busy	0
the quality is very good	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt care	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
very tight joints excellent fit and finish and excellent hook ups	1
i wo not going to go into details here as the other sites go into detail in their reviews but i am very pleased with the speed of the installation the automation and the convenience conveniences this unit offers	1
having access to so much information where ever you go is amazing	1
with it so anytime we wanted to use it we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the side of the router because the gui one would not work	0
it is great if you are traveling all over the world with your family	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1

i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
i think i think the satellites look ugly	0
have been using it for years and have had no problems	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
michael wow i loaded my entire collection of music which is mainly cds and still have gb out of my system this is great	1
i just wanted to see if it would play and it did	1
games have a lot of stink and you know you have to use the link cable to get additional features	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
finally i have my hands down the best deal for t mobile as a carrier	0
hooked up to the d link and down to mbps and then back up to m	0
the colors and textures are great	1
they fired away and the shots rang out quite loudly	1
as always free shipping by amazon items arrived in the mail	0
tough but otherwise fine	0
kind of weird and i think it is awkward but i can deal with that	1
this page	1
the ipod user interface and battery is a great improvement over the ipod is great	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i bought it at amazon because it got good reviews as a good value for money on a variety of occasions	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb is really good and there is reflection but i only really like it when the sound is off in which case you can use you own sound on it	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the screen quality in the side view is	1
l a schools say yes others say not bright enough	0
speakerphone	1
download directly from the xtra click on the player to open it up in a browser and you can listen to your stored mp s as they play	1
this product is hard to beat	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
multiple shuffle modes are available in the form of album shuffle which is available on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not included in this list	0
make it super easy	1
billy joel was right when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of shoes	1
it sounds great in the kitchen or on my coffee stand	1
the router has the ability to communicate with static ip addresses firewalls and many other programs	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
it is small and cheaper than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because ipod is less expensive but not necessarily because it is used more	1
note that it is a public display for the u s navy	1
they have a variety of devices that all have different functions	1
i have no doubt rrb and amazon are trying to make a good quality product these random prices kills it for me i pay more than what amazon is charging for selling this router at least to me	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
only thing i can think of is no camera	0
the backlight on the phone goes off for too long and there is no reply	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
its a great opportunity for a lot of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
they do look cool in it though	0
the colors and everything are beautiful	1
the router was similar to or possibly slightly better than the old linksys router i had been using for years it was also	1
i am enjoying my phone so much	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output stopped	0
battery life is limited because i use it every day and i have to charge it every hour or so or so	0
this is wonderful to have you back	1
this one was working fine for the st week and a half and then it stopped	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
i am absolutely in awe of this new canon and how it fits into the g	1
the dvd player is	1
i love it and it is a great gift	1
this app is good with a huge array of apps and games built into it	1
if i were to put them on my listening list i wouldnt be giving but i m giving because i think they do the job that i hired them for	0
the only one is the one which has a line of sight	0
this has nothing to do with how good it is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not the one time before	0
the screen is large enough and the resolution is sharp enough that you ll never have to worry about workspace issues	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
so yes as with all software that comes with a gui it was useless and ugly	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
instead	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
one thing i have found that i havent liked is that it is hard to read in daylight but it is readable at night thanks	1
our special friends at creative music made this thing good sound quality great features great price and great sound quality	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to a computer or external receivers	0
i was nt surprised when he said you get more mileage from a variety of speakers	1
it seems to me that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
if you re looking for a challenge this is it	1
customer service and technical support are unresponsive and nonresponsive to questions from you about the quality of their products and their willingness to put money behind them	0
the price performance looked just right	1
i love this player and am extremely happy for him	1
the odds are against us even in macro	0
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
harmon international has developed a number of hi fi systems and on all of these equipment the band produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
in which others are not bright enough	0
the g had trouble focusing in low light and would not turn off the light when the button was pressed but after turning it off for a few seconds	0
they were both good	1
and the truth is there is no doubt about that	1
it also has a	1
music in order of album shuffle etc is available on all jukebox players but it is worth noting that the zen xtra is not included in this matter	0
the monitor works very well with it	1
this is probably one of my favorite games because it can handle almost everything you throw at it	1
i do nt think that really matters but i was able to hook it up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
it is not	0
the quality of design and construction are outstanding as is the legendary quality of service	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
so thats what i did and i recommend this to anyone who wants it also anyone else who wants a harddrive based cd player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
when i got it to work for my friend who is having a party in longer term the speaker wire worked as expected out of doors	1
however as with all built in flashes in this game you get overilluminated main subjects with depth of field enjoy	1
there is a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be plugged in the actual usb local storage device and be able to drag and drop files etc etc etc etc	1
i deleted it and will not do anything now i deleted it when i saw it	0
very easy to scroll in menu bar	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
this is by far the best camera in its price and quality i have ever used	1
the larger lens of the g makes it easier to see in low light and the times optical zooms gets you closer	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
we are very pleased with the performance of the team and the company	1
however the main reason i am not buying it is the fact that it will end up at my house	0
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
so thank you and good luck to all your friends who are looking for a mountain of money for a laptop that can t do half the things this laptop can and for a fraction of the price	1
this is why i e it is early in the morning and you want to listen to easy music rather than music with no lyrics	1
the face scan feature can be turned off easily by clicking on a button which is one of the most intuitive and intuitive controls i have ever seen or used	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in the development of the device	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
one of the best price and best features makes this player the best on the market	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the combination of the price storage and performance makes this one of the best on the market	1
mr trump is trash	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best game i have ever played available available under	1
i get to chapter and it freezes	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
after a while the quality of the disks was finally recognized but it was slow and features not available	0
their network coverage is poor and the network always seems overloaded resulting in people calling in sick	0
the app is easy to navigate can modify existing playlists and has a removable battery it has a huge storage capacity for music	1
what makes this camera something i can live with is the depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams and lenses	1
i recommend unreservedly the g to anyone looking for a good digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better out there now	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
so far the router has worked	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has a better chance to work	1
what i dont include here is a camcorder battery that will allow me to use it all day without worrying about charging	1
rrb failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home i have to use rrb	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
the monitors were both good	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
the system used to be better designed	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
i m very happy with these i would like to see more for the front channels	1
but about of dvd is i have a bit of a problem when watching a movie it will freeze but the movie still plays and eventualy the movie comes back in after skipping it	0
the problem is that the fastest speed in the world has been reached when in the same room	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
i am absolutely in love with all of this and canon put enormous quality into it	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon at pm and with no problems it was at my door by the time i got home	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
it works and looks great if you can get the hang of how easy it is to play	1
i quickly got to used to the interface and can now use it fast enough	1
halfway through the router progress is slow the web browser is not found screen and most of the router is interface	0
this is extemely lame	0
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
the door closed	1
key words	1
this thing is huge and i like to use it to keep up with my work and also to refer to my old track records	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
i will keep you posted on all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
this is a great piece of kit system and it is worth every penny	1
the best at an incredible price	1
my gut tells me the nomad will turn out to be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or save files in order to be able to buy products from again	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can download it to your tv and watch it on your computer that way if you want to	1
very easy to scroll in and out etc	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
another nice thing is that the unit has a digital memory card slot but the latter was not available in the store so i d scanned before buying	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
got a text message error problem days after purchase	0
i can see a drastic difference between the two in terms of quality	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
i am glad i did not do a lot of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi and bluetooth modules	1
despite me giving kudos to the app for music streaming i experienced a flaw using the app	0
the colors and everything are great	1
i would have rated it stars but for the poor acting	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
my computer is very hard to operate crashes when i try to set my music library up does not work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
this page	1
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
the mp players are cheaper than the ipod but i have never listened to them and even at the beginning did not find them to justify the huge increase in price	0
however i did fail and i failed	0
the woofer	0
this is the reason why it does nt work as well as i d like i d like it	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
bottom line is for the price these things are great and worth it	1
this thing is trash	0
great camera for investment	1
the scroll bar that is used to scroll is poorly designed and not user friendly	0
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
connection to the internet is so easy	1
in fact it caused my system to crash so i stopped and replaced it with mediasource	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the story does not end at of the end of canon just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
i have this on my laptop and it works flawlessly	1
i hate apex but i love it and i love	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the problem is that the fastest thing that has happened to it has been around forever even when in the same place	0
im glad i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and using it thanks	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
having usb ports allows for very fast transfers	1
when i take it to the doctor for my daughter is running in longer lengths than as expected even out of sequence	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
how you can connect to more than one computer	1
i would not be inclined to purchase it again	0
over all a very good camera which has taken us all to on a totally new level	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
great battery life good battery replaceable powerful battery good software set up sleep timers	1
it would have been much nicer if it had zoomed in so you could see the screen and if the screen did zoom in	0
i have been using it for years and now it shows images of various colors and de focused images	0
all is good with a wide array of options built into it	1
i tried to play this game a few times with no success	0
it disappears and dissapears in your pocket	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
you of course have to deal with that as well	1
i love it though and will be sending this awful deceptive email back thanks at am i right	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0

no dropouts and good signal strength all over my three story house unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and operation	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
however shareport on this server has worked of the past	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
it would just go on and stop and on	0
best of sound	1
the backlight will not turn on the first time it happened i had to take it in for warranty repair	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the investment	1
i am sure this will have problems in the future and the for the time being no questions asked the replacement warranty will be worth it but i will only use it for now which in itself is frustrating	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
i quickly learned how to use it and can play any song on youtube etc fast enough	1
over all a very good camera which made us experience a lot on the trip	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i use than i do on my computer or at least to my ears and i rrb for less than half the cost	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
and since he has it for such a good price how can you go wrong	1
i was impressed by this young player for the first three games and then it all went downhill	0

i think i think the satellites look ugly	0
i can see a big difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of resolution and viewing angles	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
overall a sweet machine	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
i have an xp box and when installing the enclosed software i did get a message that there was a problem installing it	0
you will see desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach files there is also a usb upgrade that allows all the usb drives to be stored in the actual computer	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
its like when you ask for a compliment and it does nt come as it should straight out of the mouth	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you can call them and do nt have to wait in line and got at least my laptop and macbook back	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while	0
i suck i need to invest in some cool stuff since it has the eax feature	0
this machine will change your whole perception of what a computer can do	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually use it to save money	0
not what i hoped for but it is nothing new	1
i tried it as a couple of different formats to see if it would work and it did	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
i find your support rude and unhelpful	0
at the very least a little more protective gear in the case would be nice	0
the video above came from my video card	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
so i reiterate my thumbs down vote for t mobile as a platform thank you	1
at ounces it is very light but not as light as	1
the eax i had did not do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited upgrade	0
it is time to switch to spot metering and actually make it work on the lcd system	0
i can get off easily but i always have my phone in the car so i did nt do it	0
this is a winner	1
paid more than what rrb is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and lrb are trying to make a good quality product and selling it low	0
one of them exhibited extremely slow responses when returning to the menu	0
the sound quality is good but it gets a tad too quiet at times when there are people on the other end of the line	0
this did nt bother me at all because it is still a decent size	1
ripping your songs and creating new ones could nt be any easier	1
the progressive motion controls can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the best and easiest remote controls i have ever used	1
user replaceable battery	1
so much as with creative products it was useless and ugly so much aswith creative products	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
they have a lot of different types of cars that all have the same sounding name	0
best in class sound	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0

the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
my browser does not work as a browser for di s and there is no way to update to it at this time	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital release available today enjoy	1

door code	1
i just made it up in my head which is very easy	1

the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i am going to carry it close to my body in places where they are not so easily found	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
my only complaint is that sometimes it wont download from the cloud and it is really annoying when it does because it takes forever	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
samsung galaxy s has its flaws but only because it has those flaws but there are problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
i found it very intuitive and knew how to manuver through the menus very quickly	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
the speakers work very well and overall the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the service from the supplier was discontinued	0
i just made it up myself which is very cool	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces the same results	0
so so off i went to get a new router and this one is what i got and it works	1
not only is it cheap but its a great way to save money which is what i have	1
however shareport on my laptop worked of the time	0
what a day	1
for a specific reason i still think its a good idea	1
this video came from my video card	0
not to mention by the time i was editing the songs the quality was pretty bad	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the other day when i was trying to get it locked up and will not work	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it for very audible conversations with friends and family	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0

it also has access through our two story building	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
this book is wonderful easy to use and very light and compact in size	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
in the hands of the team it will bring good results on sunday	1
i think this is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
the phone is a blessing if you have a new phone and want to upgrade your old phone upgrading to this phone saved me a lot of time entering passwords	1
i think it is very functional and i can use it in the car and even with freeway noise	1
what is a great advantage over the ipod is the price which costs to buy it is	1
i would have done it myself but for the lack of manual	0
i have owned it for a short time now and i nt give it up for anything	1
it is very nice the controls are easy to use the battery lasts for hours on one single charge the software is very good and it is beautiful in the casing	1

works super well	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0

with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and a great speaker wire for stand ups	1
what a sweet machine	1
a little bit sore but otherwise fine	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
it didnt work so i ended up laying it on its side	0

how to hook up	1
by setting the shutter to the lowest setting and getting the camera ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to expectations	1

at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
acer has been hard to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a very poor facility to do so	0

after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
i m extremely glad i did	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
if you have an ipad and do not need this this is a much better buy plus you can store it which is a plus for those who want to buy it just to play	1

the story broke after a month	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the sounds were as the movie would have been	1
their network coverage is very poor and they always seem to be overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
it has a good balance of power and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound overall it is better than the quickly revised nx system	1

the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that may arise	1
i found the interface very intuitive and knew how to manuver through the menus very quickly	1
the monitors were both black	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
i selected the right one and have gotten it right every time	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
this product is good to be able to integrate my clarion calls to music	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on it a few times when watching a movie the picture will stop but the sound will play and eventualy the picture comes back in after skipping a few seconds	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1

the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
you have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass so you will need a good subwoofer	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
after returning it we bought this router for our new computers but it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we returned it	0
i am not connected or anything after downloading songs all i get now is player error	0
the software which comes with it is not good enough	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
