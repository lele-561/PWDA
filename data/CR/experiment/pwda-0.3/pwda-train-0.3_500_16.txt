however user interface of the the i think creative software is not real intuitive	0
it also has a web app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts the data into english	0
has many other ir just to name one the above view as the most beneficial	1
convenience can be used because it works through the usb port	0
also the carrying  case that came though i cant see the screen even with mine covers up the display the case and lift so even though the side controls i cant see the screen even with mine covers up the display the case and lift so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open front of the phone it up to see the display i cant use the carrying case tha  are reachable i have to side controls are reachable i have to open front of the phone it up to see the displayals open front of the phone it up to see the display	1

lrb internet connected the router was service with restored when the computer lost internet connection was directly to the modem rrb	0
quite simply  the firmware and i believe that or the os that control this is being used to run thing is not system ready for prime time	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was not but was not	0
how the zen lets you connect to more than one computer	1
