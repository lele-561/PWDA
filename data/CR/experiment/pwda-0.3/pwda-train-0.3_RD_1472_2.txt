good life	1
the ability to connect to router is a nice feature backing up from my various computers	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
the first i got this phone i put it next to me when i to bed to listen to my favorite music station and the itself does nt weight anything too feel so	0
it is to use yet very feature rich	1
in addition seems if re about five feet the player although that may just the batteries that	0
with on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
one complaint is scratched	0
my only complaint is that the cord not long enough	0
wap and gprs will only through t mobile is services because they menu options would enable you to configure to used a different network	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
i am able to carry it close to my body places other phones are not so	1
into buying more than the standard set of features and this item in	1
the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good you have everything	1
it through	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
sounds the patio on my night	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
the build quality is top notch	1
the sounds were the intended	0
built quality and lens	1
i do nt think that though i mean hooked my xbox up the standard vga port little ago the picture was awesome	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
pros i went to get a faster this one did i bought it for admirably	1
so now it still plays you just can t see	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
the size is small	1
the labeling is mystery and just scrambling to put out fires	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i did nomad explorer to work	1
with mediasource being so easy i no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
price gb of storage	1
mp x optical zoom takes with detail challenges all of easy understand a lot of features comes with great software and but fiance is stamp	1
is the incredibly remote is worse cheaper apex units	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the size a little bit than ipod it a little bit	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
but this not documented in zen manual the hard copy cd	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the software comes with player not at all	0
after it a month i could not play any dvd	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere g does sync of third party flashes just as does dedicated flashes	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
is too expensive	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
it and momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt out to be true in my case	1
great price	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
it really impressed me disign the the price	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
with it anytime we made changes router had to manually press the turn on radio button on of because the gui would nt work	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
it would spin read some more and then on the display that there was no disc	0
i would be inclined to purchase an apex product again	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
would definatley recommend to a friend its volume can a house such a small system	1
along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors why i picked	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
the combination of price storage size makes the best market	1
excellent range	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
sound quality is very good	1
it is a great you are traveling over the world wonderful features	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
after it for i state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers for	1
at day i was which allows me to easily go the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features meets	1
but then again the ringer be so ringing inside my office when i was already out	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can understand eax would introduce	1
the setup process the nomad is infuriating the interface with the player is sub par	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
with this box is that it reboots several if not frequently	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
technology well integrated with will enjoy	1
i have no problems with phone	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
creative mediasource software is ok rip catalog burn music if you from scratch but i musicmatch to my cds i bought the zen guess what	0

the headphone earbuds so just	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
the aff feature did the letterbox to of screen the image still looked normal	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
means that there a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	0
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
the g has system from the smaller cameras the battery needs charged while in but enables use the camera plugged in without running down the battery	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
it has none	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1

the internal network functioned but it not pass through from the cable modem	0
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
the lcd screen very large and readable	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0

i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
because it can a so photographer take spectacular photos	1

very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
myself at christmas because it got as a value for the money on a of different sites	0
i it was just the player but then i checking the discs find is actually ruining my media	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
or maybe netgear so up the firmware for this device that it does nt know	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
subwoofer is a tad boomy and s w and it still unnatural even with turned all the down but is right because are computer speakers	0
is easy often obvious m no annie lebovitz i was able to figure of its abilities just messing around at a camera store	1
i have for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
in addition comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
can get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without booming from the sub woofer no how you tweak the levels	1
way less expensive the ipod	1
this really rocks	1
lrb lost internet connection the router service was the connected to modem rrb	0
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0

i got it today works great sound for its size and price i understand the volume for iphone and two different things that be placed at to better sound so i do nt for of being to control my i highly	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
we got this on time and it brand new perfect as can be keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy my opinion comes to	1
so have no complaints this to anyone who wants quality over anyone who wants a harddrive based player wants pay next to nothing	1
the money apex machines	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
the auto focus performs well but i the optional scene modes they are dummy proof in which i seek use the camera	0
for sound are generally	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
it is switch spot and actually see it working the lcd screen	1

before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1

the router with ip addresses firewalls numerous other programs	0
does not mac support for the adapter however i was able to a free third party driver that is	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
the functionality this camera is mind blowing	1

in all i d say this a decent router for the money	1
i have not of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very	1
router is the i have used to date	1
purchased of at very good rates from amazon we pleased	1
the pc side software can be goofy and little getting is not as bad as some reviewers	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
about a month can state unequivocably this delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1

the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
speakerphone and has some nice extra features currency converter and stopwatch	1
its annoying when pay router and it nt as it out of box	0
any tweaking if the exposure is accurate are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film this is a raw image	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well there more wap pages available	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
as stands now pretty useless unless packing the player up for or if you load all your songs beforehand	0
the interface are very easy to use	1
my gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
setup very	1
i made several back ups of my dvd movies using r and it plays the	1
i love this player	1
the attachment allowed to buy and a sophisticated flash unit	1
spectrum from full base to highs	1

purchased a jukebox got they asked for just to look at it and charge me repaing the damned thing	0
it lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
these speakers are great	1
often the is however not difficult to use or horrible	1

i to great photos the th of fire works and got of the with sparklers	1

lastly that speakers were over priced for what i got lrb there is some inherent in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
after years with that expensive horrible customer service portability	0
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0

the it was great but	0
the only things i is is hard to read in daylight everyone elses is too	0
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0

upon opening these to be really small but having a solid feel them	1

they have a bunch of devices that all have sounding name	1
t heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
it just and display no disc	0
can on the fly without aid of a computer you can use play modes for your or playlists	1

however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty volume at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
the system is size and better the ipods	1
highly a nokia	1

unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0

i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
because this camera	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
hate	0
i purchased two for gifts and both	1
re for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
re pretty comfortable and deliver a decent audio quality	1
but it is	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
anyway this player is and love it	1
ve purchased universal remotes so far claiming to apex dvd players and none worked	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0

the replacement was even worse than was now working fine	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
the sound is pretty good lrb anything like a surround system rrb is reflection but i only it when the display is off which own reflection on the screen	0
although the sound quality is it more than sound on a portable mp player to result in	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
even it on produces	1
due to lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork just the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
this phone is with a huge array of features built	1
they clears and perfect to be	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
a week out of the box and began to see slight contractions of the time to time growing more frequent each	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
time link support was and guided me to actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed my fios optical network block	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
pros cost win home premium hdmi port lrb could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv its delivering great	1
small size	1
i ve had no problems so far and m	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
organization is based this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with id information	0
it is light enough to carry all day without bother	1
first of all player is superior to the ipod	1
seemed like a good deal this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0

i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
did on my personal notebook	0
image clarity great lrb i do a lot of in with mb raw image files and noticed the difference	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0

the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1

apex is the	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
that is still less even the lowest level ipod i able get gb the best part is it works as great as it advertised to then some	1
is that the has connected to it has around mb s even when in the same room	0
however some of the software was starting to bog it the point where i having to reset it far too often in order reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
everything i expected it to be an dvd as advertised	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
i would strongly this product	1
the sound is the battery life is excellent the fact that the is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod excellent	1
the sound from cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1

it does not auto focus assist light which is taking shots it allows the camera to focus in	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1

equipment included average but that is nt a big deal that not what you are buying it for	1

it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1

are minor the feel and layout so so does nt show with really long every zoom setting getting back to	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
in summary i love this camera whole recommend this anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1

the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally price cheaper than the gb ipod is	1
i found process very easily mastered	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
you can the lens barrel in the view finder	0
amazon was wonderful about the next day and paying for the return shipping	1

the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
the creative zen has all the features the i pod has if you from amazon only to for great player	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
keys close together and the is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the gb zen xtra socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
you store on it which is all who to buy an ipod just to an ipod do bother this is a much better buy	1
my blu ray wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light smoke after a good firmware upgrade well forever thereafter	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
simple click buttons volume and display are very easy to read use	1
i this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago have been very with it	0
game for a little fiddling may very this day forecaster	0
pc cable too expensive for usb cable	0

they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
is that it dropped security settings once and am not sure why do nt know if was something that i did or it was a malfunction	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too at times there quieter talkers on of the line	1
despite minor disappointment i recommend the canon g anyone is about digital photography	1
it is a fun little gadget expect high definition sound	0
i	1
this was	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle is on all jukebox players worth noting is in this matter	1
what got to buy was that it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
not only is the perfect size it also has tech user would want	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
completely useless as since it obscures display window	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
is average but is since s not you are buying it for	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
took me a few tries get is very user player imo	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
i have nt had really push this player to the limit aspects on the nomad are as should be expected from creative labs	0
claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks	0
great picture	1
the only thing do nt like about this is the cover	0
gave it only stars due to the that the st one broke when i dropped from a fairly short distance	0
not only is it functional and but is candy	1
it and ones	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1

when took with of and the objects were moving were awesome	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
the image quality is excellent	1

bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
also the carrying case that came up so even though the side controls reachable have open it up to see the display	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i was live with the larger size but the durability was big zero	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1

bottom line well made camera easy use and powerful use flash lense filters choices	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to excel	1
it did a dvd r which in my older machine	1

overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
on the positive side of the is once you have configured	1
the are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
is quite powerful	1
the creative software is to use plain nt load on some computers	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any battery powered	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the keys are close together and the layout a bit to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
great picture	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
i be again	1

the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0

i have it and camera	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
was affordable very easy to learn produces images	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
the battery is nice	1

i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
the picturers are amazing	1
surprisingly work well	1
player freezes not a very big problem but can annoying	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
itself has all sorts	1
day i d leave sprint	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
or maybe netgear so up it does nt know what to do	0
used it frequently and have had	1
i have tried a hold of apex who does seem to answer their emails and number is constantly busy as lonely customer service rep is extremely overworked	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
again the sounds were from where they should the front of the tv	1
the catch with the canon g camera that its unresponsiveness will cause you miss	0
the excels a cell phone thank god	1
lrb lost internet connection was restored when the computer was connected directly	0
this slim design out	1
the service t mobile is good too	1
while i phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and	1
the moveable lcd screen is	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the optical zoom great and x digital is a very nice addition although at highest digital are a little blurry	1
when the matrox g dvi card comes out ll consider more of these super displays	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists nt be any easier	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
is the most bang for the buck out there	1

the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
overall sweet machine	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0

the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
i do which allows a one click synchronization and the music collection on the	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the was great but upon enabling the guest network things	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
bottom line a set of speakers in creative i trigue speakers on my computer lrb least to rrb for less than half the cost	1
after discovered the problems we tried to contact apex we never got in with the customer support telephone number is they not answer their web customer support	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
sure can be a setting one where you need volume be at a whisper	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
the technical support phone line for my	0
also it was with free shipping and tax so overall it is a decent player	1

is larger than the has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully the green backlight did	1
quite bulky and a battery although not as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
buttons seem and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
it was very easy set a as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
is clear if your not on	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
i sent to service requesting an ra with no response	0
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
a disappointment	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1

tries one of the disks was finally video was poor features	0
have had no problem what so with this product	0

navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
slow to download and run certain programs and hope	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
there which has been said about the of phone it any problems	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
creative software is awkward difficult to use plain nt load on	0

however it does not play windows media and can not it any of my divx rips	0
and the body construction general has of plastic after	0
i avoid horns but i do hear anything overly extreme	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
it plays i ve so far even an old vcd that ripped and the rental dvd that nt be played my old sharp	1
while laptop and netbook have the volume on such devices inherently lower standard speakers it to hear some audio	0
what disappointed me the fact that does not seem read certain dvds	0
i these speakers and found them well below	0
this player is not and i recommend that do nt purchase it	0
i this player	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
i tried calling the support number for a week times a day got a busy signal	0
i am absolutely awe of camera canon put enormous quality	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
frame freezes and the yells somethings with the dvd player come quick	0
i for any with it however i will this product be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting item to was faster than i expected and is what knew it would	1
works great	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
like you ll use a very expensive modem as i the item and got a instead	0
bright visible screen	1
the scroll wheel over the ipod touchpad	0
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
this product is amazing	1
harmon international done on avr crystal clear sound with clarity	1
very tight joints black finish and hook ups	0
i sent my monitor in to for for such a small but very problematic of random buzzing from my acer gd hz	0

it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
works super easy	1
the buttons interface very easy to use	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
anyways back the i tried to be so over the past month of dealing and their terrible support	0
last note i purchased this with a higher price what you can get in the states	1
this is deal for music and data storage	0
i ve this thing month and the headphone jack	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
i it to is graduation party in longer lengths worked expected even out	1
the itself which be user friendly but easy use	0
worked for weeks video failed	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
and i love extremely low loud bass as such i suplemented the system with a jbl sub	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
you re taking brisk waiting for a bus or just you ll be you the fm radio	0
the sound quality has been day one constantly drops calls seems be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it	0
all features	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
the build quality solid it does shake while playing discs and and is top notch	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the is superb with nokia pc suite software	1
the appearance is okayed	1
the is great	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
i dissapointed that acer nt more	0
i excellent hearing the level on is especially	1
is ok	1
the range great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement all the time	1
this is the electronic devices that ve ever owned	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i but unforutnately i am it	1
the day arrived when i was sure leave sprint	0
so sit back and brag to your friends who paid mountain for a dvd player that can t do half the things can and for a fraction of the price	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes is not enough	0
seems good very lttle time to it uploads mp quickly there is no delay between songs	1
acer has been deal with treat their customers rubbish have to match their products	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
to read most dvds fine reads quietly	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
easy go online and adjust it there	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
but seems to work now i do nt any problems it	1
i owned a short time and nt give for anything	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
most will and is no exception however are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy my old	1
with gb of storage about songs on the player room for	1
lots of but exceptional sound quality size and price make it a good buy	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the speakers perform very well and with fills outs exceedingly well	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
connect to your computer open up mediasource and you listen to your mp s as they	1

now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
the routers good for years	1
we are pleased with the monitor and the company	1
we got this time and was new perfect condition performance can be expected for the machine keep i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
nt firewire not a real complaint since most windows do nt generally have themselves	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and songs sound worse than without it	0
will read and play all cd audio disc	1
this router is phenomenal	1
not is it more affordable its for i have	0
is clearly superior	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
you can not get decent mid or without from the sub woofer no matter how you	0
player works looks great if you can get the dvd play	1

my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
you that upgrade is irreversible	0
i had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
creative mediasource software is ok rip catalog burn music if are but i musicmatch to rip my cds bought the guess what	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1

the came	1
problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router only lasted months	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the features are really cool like	1
now i have all my on it there has nt been any more problems	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
will the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
complaint like others it disconnects from the bluetooth annoying when it does it does it so often	0
very good value for the money	1
then dvds stop in the middle not be at all	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the g looks like a work of art	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
the size and of this little critter	1
minor even though the music is sorted via i tag on the player option to search music is	0
first the a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt	0
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
does not at random times despite being connected is library	0
i m glad decided to keep and upon it with new technology	1

they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
bigger than expected but that ok because i is something work with my iphone	0
so far have not had any problems with dvds being able to play	1
great	1
the software has nt been a hassle at all	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
sharp picture and for	1
can t go wrong with this price	1
i am quite happy the camera	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
i ordered it on monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb with no extra shipping the my door in chicago by the got home from work tuesday	1
great colors pictures white balance	1
this a little than oz	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player probably the best out there	1
it to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt rrb which nt that bad until you get nailed times in hour lrb that is about bad it sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
the replacement was even the original one was working fine	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
the only thing i m concerned about the quality longevity the buttons the thing	0
mid range best but it is certainly enough to satisfy anyone not looking spend on computer speakers	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
that the wireless speeds to those of my home wireless router using my home broadband cable as	1
stoppped playing higher number scenes	0
connection speed to seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with simplicity the valet this makes for a great product	1
one bad thing is that it comes and most purposes it	0
spent considerable time with professional video gear find onscreen displays annoying	0
will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the of this speaker	0
the speakers are about it good for the size the range you might expect perhaps even better expected rrb	1
fantastic esp w docked	1
they are and perfect to used along with a sub	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
bottom line for the price sound great and have of good bass	1
the also and quite comfortable although it take some used to	1
this is recommended otherwise	1
maybe it my lack of experience i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
without having to the netgear genie tool through the isp taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
complaint about the speakerphone you can the speakerphone once the person answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
was to live with the larger size but the durability	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the software the router is pretty good	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
software is easy to use	1
it more than days and it not show the picture no matter what i do	0
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
it also does nt have dialing big minus	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
an phone	1
but to that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	0
the backlight the phone goes off too quickly and there no way to change this	0
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems as not recognizing a dvd stopping particular point in a movie we able to certain special features on a rental dvd	0
its which might to matter except if you use it while running keep it in your pocket	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
it also has unproven battery life	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
chose this one because from what i read it the best deal for the money	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
and really this is the best phone one	1
it enough to for like but it has plenty of features me to grow into	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
it just such a nice light weight device which can take anywhere	1
works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
otherwise this player is awesome	1
main dial is not backlit	0
the subwoofer gets really high	1
love the quality of	1
above it has for everyone point and shoot plus for those are about photography	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
it has failed to deliver on quality	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
usb network storage supposedly is slow	0
for the price it	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
the are awesome i mention they were	1
no firewire to the camera	0
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
apex is support number numerous times but it just kept	1
this will change your whole a laptop should be	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
amazon amazing return policy i return no loss on my part	1
second menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that your ipod is in an case you not dock the ipod first removing the skin	1
the sound quality excellent the unit looks cool screen bright and easy to read the replaceable battery means major advantage over the ipod	1
set up with problems	0
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1

really easy set up out of the box and got my wireless lrb laptops desktop and smartphones connected the internet in minutes	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
t mobile is heavily back logged keep up with demands	0
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when	1
this thing is great i use it up tough stains on my countertop and listen to my old track records	1
i had no problems setting the software getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
my friends impressed with the the i took	1
ve viewed since a college student poor of picture quality ve seen	0
and works great too	1
i with easy this camera is	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
storage	1
had problems in low light and not take picture when shutter was pressed but after shutter had been released few	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
i works for its size and price the volume for iphone and the towers own are two that should placed the right measures to so i complain for the fact of the remote not being able my iphone i recommend this tower	0
i had problem musicmatch software already computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
another of note the battery life is	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount paid	0
for me perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
than that the sound and i would purchase this all over again	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
d link support was polite and tried help but worked through and was	0
great product unbeatable price	1
it for this being extremely easy use well laid out controls that be quickly	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i was dissapointed that acer nt more	0
prepared for but the wait was worth it	0
volume	0
this system is very powerful	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
the volume	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
takes excellent photos	1
those used to find friendly to use	0
the in program i d editing a strong point as well	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
for a still think great phone	1
zen suffers from difficulty using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback with the headphone jack	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
p s the remote control does seem to get times and nt respond but it may be just operator error	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
it has much router it	1
just average getting good value	1
first of all sound quality superior to	1
naturally i quite a bit purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
and with usb transferring your player is incredibly easy	1
the screen and the blue light is bright enough read at night dim enough so it does when you too long	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
but if you looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love	1
overall would reccomend these who a set of small but effective computer at a reasonable price	1
after i had it got into it could never the device i my pc the reloaded drivers etc etc creative is was at all	0
scroll overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
sure it had all the features but i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
programming and exposure gives you yet its progam and auto exposure provide excellent photos if you do want to bother with the settings	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
this model will not work with my universal remote control	0
through the menus is super easy have owned a previous nokia phone	1
awesome sound system	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
it has never worked	0
the is too small it took like a half hour just to to fit in cage	0
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
technical unhelpful	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
nice color	1
along with the replaceable battery were two main factors on why i	1
anyways back the point i ve tried to be so calm the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
was flawless with the instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt nobody mention this	1
i used now it shows a of various colors and de focused text	0
great features	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the image quality is excellent	1
to download sort upload and digital pictures on the computer is very nice and easy use	1
the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
bothered by blown out and the g seems to	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
to everything else this category this most the best bang for the buck	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
the software is very easy to use and minutes of i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as face plate is prone	0
the g had problems focusing and the picture the shutter was pressed but had a few seconds	0
and usb transferring music to your player incredibly easy	1
as it the is pretty you re packing the player up for travel or if all songs beforehand	0
sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple modes	0
could be more comfortable no complaints in department	1
plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased of already been	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
this its got features a beatiful and its tiny	1
easy to use with contained in the install drive	1
small light and very attractive	1
great camera	1
used monitor for a few months and have had problems	0
question it the sound good for the size the range is what you might expect speakers this size lrb even better than expected rrb	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
software is easy to use	1
now i it however i can t imagine being without it	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0
the i found i havent liked is that is hard to read but is too	0
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
ooh dropped it it works fine camera so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the reason i rated it four is of that darn diopter hard to turn you can t an accurate adjustment	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
although the nokia is little short it is an piece of what it was to be	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
this product hard beat any price	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
in device customer service run like hell from this product	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
i of these and polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
best electronic i i	1
no way the battery supplied hours	0
creative mediasource not as sleek looking as mediaplayer is effective and is linked	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
the tiny not only does it the shutter it can used to zoom review pictures	1
so easy to set up had some problems archos	1
i the fact i can carry in or pants pocket and about it	1
considering the price and specs might be best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
over the network storage is slow but only use it occasional backups does bother me too much	0
really no complaints over unit	0
the s pii	0
quality features	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
the changing colors help to with a quick glance	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
the build quality is top notch	1
the only minor i have with the camera are is fairly boxy looking it needs wrist strap instead of a neck strap it a bit slow between shots	0
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
of as indicated above has something for point and shoot power advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
i tried and back saying undeliverable	0
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
in addition comes with sleek and powerful headset	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
tried to in my brothers house one didn work either	0
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
i the powershot and	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
like the nomad it is terribly flashy	0
this dvd play is basicly	1
i thought the software was decent enough it complicated to learn all	1
for it worked almost perfectly	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
well backlit keypad	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
in short if you just that is little and you a router to get online do basic networking play mafiawars and browse myspace all this router is great for you	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major brick and mortar retailers they both delivered great results	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better	1
this second creative labs mp player it definitely a fine product	1
creative from quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel about problems the headphone jack	0
i love the remote controller stand with it is big knob and	1

ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the pictures are razor sharp	1
is not good either and the driver trouble with other sound blaster is	0
the subwoofer is boomy and s l o w still unnatural with know down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0

i am very pleased with it so far	1
i attempted to connect unit to several different tvs using a multitude of methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
this led monitor fantastic	1
screen and eventually shows no disc	0
these speakers have great sound but they will if leave them on with turned up	1

p computer does everything hoped for work study travel	1
canon does it consistently	0
technology wise is awesome plus the makes it even great i love phone	1

i the nomad zen lock up several times	0
these are incredibly amazing	1
if want to rename a cd title you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the nikon a very dependable little camera	1

you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
we are well pleased with the monitor the	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1

the cover came with it did nt very	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1

too difficult change	0
for a well spent investment	1

once the volume a little a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get with some background music viola audio great lrb well is relative great for a computer speaker	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant the are very good provided that your subject away	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
to read most dvds fine and	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
this is worth the purchase	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
in all this is another excellent creative product	1
has many other ir just to name one the above view as the most beneficial	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
did nt abuse it i every day but the jack just sort of fizzled out	0
the is a durable package i find nikon to be a brand that can trust	1
i have tried several times to contact apex through their on line support site and their telephone line but wo answer my emails telephone is always busy	0
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1

cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
if nt have tags ll lump all of your tracks into directory they not searched via artist or album the zen does not recognize folders	0
i simply love this feature	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
i like the nomad is but it	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
overall an excellent phone	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment plopping down half a grand for	1
headphones suck i would invest some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
works super easy	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the do not automatically play one like on a cd	0
so if game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased	1
the eax features pretty as well included a of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a or	1
and man had to work on because had actual names the title	0
asking for specifically for christmas many different mp players but finally decided this one that i could nt be happier and i is	0

the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
surprised good the sound was and i especially like i am listening to audio books	1

the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
i m not to shoddy construction on something paid over dollars for	1
simply canon today at this price point	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
another nice thing the unit has both optical and digital audio outputs the mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
nice machines but i consider pretty low now	0
another point is incredible	1
fact it caused to hang more times than not so and stuck	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
no propietary headset jack	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the manual mode is easy to use access for the shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1

not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
my gut tells me nomad will in the long run be a gb portable hard drive one i can at worst a very expensive lesson never	0
it is gb of disk space	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
i would recommend in every hold or environmnets	1
zoom up down in magnification which is nice but is a display the of the way down the top of the screen interferes with viewing at most settings	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
