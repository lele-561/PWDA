easy to hook	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
it holds much music and audio files	1
have to press the buttons hard i end pressing enter i meant to scroll	0
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
great to switch to spot metering and see it the lcd screen	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
it is smaller than i expected when i as it turns	0
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
wowable good	1

replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
if want to rename a cd title you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the grain was terrible	0
the camera very easy to use in fact a recent trip this past week i was asked of a vacationing elderly group	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
the zen stars because is for class that it is in and not really appropriate to rate it on players in	1
value	1
in the user interface	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
in addition comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
this second creative labs mp player it definitely a fine product	1
to for player	1
are really the radio	1
was to the front plate and there was the battery could be inserted	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house unit located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly the setup and security aspects	1
the main problems is that the dsub cord to the is too short	0
it would have much nicer if it a window so could see the if did nt cover up the ac jack	0
however for budget think is an excellent choice	1
we got phones for the t mobile family plan and came with a broken headphone and one died after less than two	0
the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy although not very solid is contructed of plastic	0
any case artist album ok however miss an ability navigate by folders	0
is pretty from such rather small drivers	1
ca that upgrade is irreversible	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
this has happened and occasionally if we it will work it work one before	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
the picturers are amazing	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
works great too	1
i have it for a week now and camera has exceeded my expectations	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the screen plus as the polyphonic ringtones	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
the full with a fair bass even for such a small	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
sound really good as the reviews	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
at first i dealt with as mbps	1
on the side the phone has amazing battery life	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
granted i have only used this dvd player setting it up for my mom for christmas was long for to find problems with this dvd player	0
overall i like it	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
so have no complaints this to anyone who wants quality over anyone who wants a harddrive based player wants pay next to nothing	1
on the keys	1
the only problem i have is clicker the mouse is stiff	0
so tired of netgear is i would never anyone i know	0
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
i have had no problems phone	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
to keep it short this is and in my opinion choice ipod	0
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
both units small with similarly small	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
i one who uses web browsing so this phone and my needs	0
the price	1
using mediasource to load your songs nomad jukebox be much easier and than using windows explorer	1

the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
the plays is has occasional problems such as not recognizing dvd stopping a particular point every time we being able to access certain special on a dvd	0
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
the player mechanics are also flawed	0
i would recommend in every hold or environmnets	1
frame freezes and the family dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
i just purchased this player and to i it	0
you ll be track information a lot the cd database information utilized by the software	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
if to across then this router do the job	1
but you ve used a slr mm camera very	0
buttons back volume and display are very easy to read and use	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
my biggest is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod	0
it is predecessor quickly revised nx this player a relatively intuitive system categorizes based i d tags and excellent sound	1

i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
because other people complain this are talking bull this player is awesome it breaks fast which horrible	1
second menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
with on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
i all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
the usb port on the back is a feature	0
is an ideal purchase	1
the manual is easy to understand and is mostly idiot	1
the only nt like about this does suck	0
the storage capacity is great for me	1
navigation system the zen uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
i am absolutely awe of camera canon put enormous quality	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
i know unit have problems in the for the year no asked replacement warranty worth it since creative will only for days which in itself totally ridiculous	0
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
the auto a great job of the time but there are manual for those who want them	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
chic look and good build the comes in compact form with a metal face plate	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
it my greatest expectations in a mp camera	0
halfway through the progress bar not found screen is interface	0
has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games the pim and the	1
would definatley recommend a friend and its volume fill a small house such a small system	1

the design is and color screen has good resolution	1

but if you looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
also i have had trouble that i created and vbr mp cds	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
the function switches between capture and view mode feels	0
can also rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
have in my playlist moment and the random does a mixing	0
it small my canon slr it fits in my pocket	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1

no matter the format	1
the colors and everything are great	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0

i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
pros competitive cost premium hdmi lrb could the amazon instant on my hdtv and its	1
the and construction as the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
picture	1
and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1

others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
slow gui be prepared to wait every time change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
feature with nokia pc suite software	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
my pictures viewable on my screen but seem as clear as when i view on my monitor	1

with it enabled anytime we had to press the front of the router because the gui one would nt	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1
and really this is the best phone one	1
software definitely hangs up my notebook time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
but anyway the only thing you really look at here is the fact that phone does have voice	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
i find it too bright	0
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
bottom the these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
overall a sweet machine	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
can goofy and takes a getting used to it not as bad some	0
another of note the battery life is	1
the toggle that is used to scroll	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0

it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0

only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
they have a bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0

the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
connection speed to the other machines much quicker than the router i replaced and valet this makes for a great product	1
the price and features it really good	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0

it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
access to so much music ever is terrific	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1

when i saw a lot plastic there was metal i that not as good	1
the display large enough and is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely workspace issues	1

the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1

i ve this thing month and the headphone jack	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1

it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1

battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
technical support rude and	0
it radio option and to music anytime	1
but canon never	0
also the carrying case that came up so even though the side controls reachable have open it up to see the display	0

the windows premium is do nt recommend starter rrb user friendly	1
i only have one complaint and is included	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1

simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0

it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
works super easy	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
i have to say m also pretty impressed the user playing jpeg mpeg	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1

great product works perfectly for my office	1
the player hangs up transfer prompting a	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the second set is working just fine	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
fly wheel cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
little camera a marriage between never i a digital camera	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the sound quality has been day one constantly drops calls seems be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
this camera	1
this wonderful product easy to	1
apparently can t up with demands	0
it is overall bigger than the ipod but keep this expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is	1
is the incredibly remote is worse cheaper apex units	0
at pretty light but not as light	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
with this mp player you get more memory for than an ipod	1

even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
has which utterly useless	0
the sound quality is really good	1
what a disappointment	0
ring tones only come songs and annoying rings there only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
monitors are great for the price	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
when the player was working it was great but	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
very the monitor and the price	1
this has capabilities that you ll always room for as they evolve	1
my only complaint to date it the security settings once and i am not why do nt was something that i did or if it was a malfunction the router	0
d link support was more helpful me which that the router to auto the link speed my fios optical network block	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
is no speaker grill to offer to the driver	0
it works great	1
however some of the bandwidth hogging software bog down to the point where was having to reset it computer too often in order to a dropped internet connection	0
user replaceable battery	1
the fact this would play jpeg slideshows a big plus me as a visual artist discovered mpeg files a regular cd r data disk	1

the door would not close	0
mediasource did not on my personal notebook	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed s video with lots	0
the top the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
everything was great until started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it take some getting	1
was flawless with the instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt nobody mention this	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1

the size a little bit than ipod it a little bit	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
it is easy enough it see you listening	1
this is recommended otherwise	1
the price it	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
like a good deal but this pos frequently can not dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes	0
in it only to work you about five feet away from the player although that may been just the batteries came with it	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
m extremely this camera	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0

of course i was hesitant given the price but been extremely impressed since receiving and bought as a christmas present my parents	1
we pleased with the monitor the company	1
main dial is not backlit	0
the network still functioned but would pass	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1

also understand why does the when the cds in alphabetical order	0
can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the grain was terrible	0
i have not even used my new dvd player already i am disapointed	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
my first impression was positive	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
kudos apple your products are of superb quality equal to that	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
works on g band than the	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
nt like to the clip is nt secure and the case can	1
is a blessing if you and your old phone book to me hours of re my	1
excellent phone phone looks much than u see in the pictures	1
bottom line unbeatable price	1
i loved the sound of these the polk and klipsich floorstandings of characteristics	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
even when you securespot completely will upon reboot your computer new it is nt and force to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files picture your you know how to program jme you can even make own games	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
bright visible screen	1
is extemely lame	0
i tried bunch of different to see if would play and it did	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
however my drive did fail and i not dropped it once	0
it works great	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors why i picked	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
the larger screen has allowed to all my photos on it nt on the dell rrb edit them	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
too difficult change	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
this product is amazing	1
it not show picture no matter what i do	0
over this is good	1
was once you got someone	0
does have firewire a complaint since most windows users do have firewire cards themselves	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
the problems came from my video card	0
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
without finest looking apex dvd player i ve seen	0
i called the tech support and helped new firmware this did solve the problem	0
unlike some of other people who a my player came in perfect working condition	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
i chose this one because from read it the best deal the money	1
but it to work so well now that i do nt with it	1
the second set is working just fine	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
d link dir extreme n wireless router works as router	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the woofer is much larger	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has itself be all that is advertised	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
of course have some good customization options the well	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack me and many others	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i was looking it even if said it was slow	0
not willing shoddy construction on something i paid for	0
this player is an ideal purchase	1
there occasionally lip sync issue	0
i m not very machine	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
over all fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
used it frequently and have had	1
these speakers are great	1
nice little phone light compact	1
it crystal clear	1
storage	1
this minor disappointment i recommend the canon g is serious about digital	0
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
i player	1
a few of my work constituants the g highly recommended the canon picture quality	1
this is a piece speaker for a computer and it worth every penny	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the device itself is pretty solid	1
however a phone call the crew was answered reasonable amount of time and they guided through process without a problem	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
this camera a cool stitch pictures feature to out just to canon is website	1
it a snap set up and my ps asus netbook and pcs all connect without issue	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
means that there is a chance that not break american phones	0
this phone won me over a big seller was size it fits nicely into any	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i purchased phone just and there is no end to what i do with it	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
is a a than oz with long battery life	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
it is running great for all the dvds have and rented	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
i do nt myself having any issues with it the coming year or two however if i with this product it will taken of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service the service in to was faster than i expected is exactly i knew it would	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
is the most bang the buck out there	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands imposing fairly well the rest	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
navigating the menus is if have a previous model nokia phone	0
completely useless as since it obscures display window	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what in the lcd what you get	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard would solely upon of it	1
third the design continues with	1
think apex the best dvd player you can get for the	1
ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set in about minutes	1
great features	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
first player quality is superior to the ipod	1
is ok	1
range was comparable to possibly slightly worse the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
have stored cd and touched the available memory	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
bright visible screen	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
only thing a cd burner	0
the scroll wheel easy to use works many have complained the wheel cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
