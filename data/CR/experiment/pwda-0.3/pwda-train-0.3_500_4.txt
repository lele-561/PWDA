not as sleek looking although a as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked good creative mediasource to cddb service	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
pictures transfer to pc from the camera using the transfer cable	0
transfering is easy makes pretty everythig the software easy	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
i find your support rude and unhelpful	0
reviews for sound quality are generally very positive	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
it but it does does nt smell like burning not plastic when even you open the drive	1
