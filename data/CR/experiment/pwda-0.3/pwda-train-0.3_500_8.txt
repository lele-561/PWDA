the e mail address i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
the auto mode works great for medical photographs and the manual mode is great for point and shoot	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
should as expected from creative labs had the nomad to nt push on to the limit but audio aspects this player time are satisfactory have i be really	1
not a bad deal to pay bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1

it is small light and nice looking and is decent as well	1
unit cameras worked great  for weeks then video output failed	0
what really made this project work for me was the software	1
on you with you can different variations pretty good with different presets can is your sound eax which get modify with it	1
very compact and portable just this model as described with great sound quality	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably  the best ive ever seen out there	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
i was pleasantly surprised that i was able to do so	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around you can always take the camera with take many pictures of them	1
at carry around the end  of the day what i wanted was a     large capacity my favourite music from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easil player which  allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of  price capacity  and features easily meets those criteria	1
one of the biggest advantages the device has is the fact that the user can recharge the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
i have my back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney dvd movies	0
is thing missing from creative only a cd burner	0
best tech support support i have ever experienced	1
easy to use beginners for will love is but has features that to photographers it more serious it is an excellent camera so grow into	1
so much this little camera has created a marriage fall in love with someone between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
leaving on crystal playback	1
it may has never worked	0
u the phone looks much the pictures see what excellent phone than in better	1
i wo with nt into the picture quality here as the online sites go the details the features reviews in pleased i but depth am very their this flexibility the speed into the great the automation and the functional conveniences go camera offers	1
to resistant scratches solid better heat dissipation	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is this probably the best best portable dvd player out there	1
pros so off i went to buy a new one and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
i am sure this is product quality customer service that i would never be able to give to anyone i know	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i can recommend it to anyone anytime	1
the remote is here a little hard to understand	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard dial tone on the phone	0
i like the picture bright colors and very light weight i think it worked like a charm	1
anyways back to the point i ve managed to be so calm over the past month of dealing with them and their terrible service and attitude	0
player is not plug and play need to install first and transfer files and i had to patient as i winxp detecting the and dragging and dropping the music files it	0
this article is an ideal purchase	1
other tagging problems that arise from the nomad is operating in isolation	0
i am using it as a left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker system	1
the front cover front cover can pop off easily but be loose but i always be a little loosebut i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day the front cover ive never been loose buti always be can pop off easily but be loose but i always be a little loosebut i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day the front cover ive never been loose buti always be ive always had mi i always be a little loose but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first da have mine in the case so i did nt be loose but i always be a little loosebut i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day the front cover ive never been loose buti always be ive always had min   notice after first day	0
the plan is okayed	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player if you are looking for dollar is probably this the best out there	1
as not also the sound level as high is i would have expected	0
the setup process the nomad is infuriating the interface with the player is sub par	0
without played without a power outlet i would say love on stage are have the same sound quality these speakers and as the jbl truly portable lrb can be a doubt i that that feature rrb	1
approximately to seconds come online i nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad you nailed times one hour lrb that as it gets goes for hours without rebooting	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be works and how fast it run pleasantly surprised by how well this baby it works and how fast it run how fast runs	1
again nt buy would because of the customer service	0
option to use also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
i did nt sounds any the side speakers like from wierd get i did with my old front speakers	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1

my thing favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
it is slightly more expensive than the original and packed with even more features	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
now original even worse than the replacement was one which was the working fine	1
yield the who of someone hands does nt on in will good results it idiot program auto mode	1

awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
excellent the phone the phone looks much better if u look at the than what u a lot see in the pictures	1
feelings mixed bag i guess but is right the price was right	1
the unit replacement had among too the little switch working properly the bottom a problem nt on making was impossible to select it city forecasts in my area	0
only i con can think of is no camera	0
this growth and you ll be able to adapt to be prepared has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new ll technologies as they the ability to be ready evolve	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with developed and you will be happy also this phone which app you will enjoy	1
in addition my experience it h it away only seems to work if you y re doesn t work if you are standing in front of the player and walking away only seems to workif you y re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came wit about five feet to that it h it away only seems to work if you y re doesn t workif you are standing in front of the player and walking away only seem to workif it hs away only works if you are abou away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
