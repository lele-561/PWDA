the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1

organization is based this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with id information	0
the price performance looked just	0
with this company	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1

someone who does nt it will yield good results idiot program auto mode	1

i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
while the the keyboard connector	0
the system was near stable and the code was at best	1

the software for raw images not present you with a raw image but the image after has processed by all the image affecting settings in camera	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also as a radio which a nice feature when you	1
what is in functionality in quality as is prone to popping off	0
the process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
the screen is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
is the most bang the buck out there	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0

this thing is trash	0
my dwl ap does not work a repeater for di s and is no firmware update to support this product	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0

stays charged a time takes more than or hours at most fully recharge the included ac adapter	1
at the least a more protective case would be nice	0
this has to find out more log on to canon is website	0
i would have rated it five stars the poor manual	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
storage	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
the function lever one which switches between capture and view mode	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
this by far in price and i have ever used	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the more i work the more i	1
the speaker phone is very i use it in the car even	0
the speakers and outs exceedingly well	1
also has unproven battery life	0
t is does not along several long stretches on that same route	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
i purchased nomad zen gb and is fantastic	1

are viewable on my screen not as clear when view them on my monitor	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0

in comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
it run should be given lots of room air circulation	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not	0
i sent my back wo nt play certain and	0

this router is awesom but it will only support you can get than to have a open nat type the are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced were very nice and thre to working but to no avail if you just have computer a laptop and fine and secure this well the money	1

a little weighty but otherwise fine	0

for the price it	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
access to so much music ever is terrific	1

with it anytime we made changes router had to manually press the turn on radio button on of because the gui would nt work	0
internet functions of phone wap gprs only work t mobile is services because they have menu options that would you to configure the phone to used	0

this item was the most inexpensive monitor time made	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
this slim design out	1
these speakers	1
the sound from cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally	0
price along with the replaceable battery were on why i picked the nomad	1
frame freezes and the family dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
worked very light weight	1
key instead	0
they claim respond a hour period yet	1
d say this is a router for the money	0
living in a small apartment the e s and e s beautiful but a for what i needed	1

they have a whole bunch of devices that have same name	0
they look fantastic	1
i use a home theater system it is amazing how it sounds is	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1

i who uses web browsing so this phone met and	0

bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
i the way it displayed information way you in zoom mode	0
apparently t mobile is logged can t up with demands	0
the problem that it reboots times an hour not more frequently	0
feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
the toggle button that is and does not work	0
this really is a great little phone its got features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and	1
keypad but the on off key is small and difficult to press	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
so far have not had any problems with dvds being able to play	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
the dvd player fine	1
was wonderful about picking it the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
lastly that speakers were over priced for what i got lrb there is some inherent in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
it has very good range much better the linksys router replaced	1
i still think it is the digital camera available under	1
the scroll bar is a bit a pain	0
player not plug and play need install nomad explorer first and to transfer files and i had to be i was used winxp detecting the player dragging and dropping the music files into it	0

fm receiver it has none	0
it is crystal clear	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
one beef is the scroll nt as well as d like	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
delivery was prompt	1
another nice thing the unit has both optical and digital audio outputs the mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
the colors and everything are great	1
the other controls very easy to use	1
mixed i guess but the price	0
it is than the and packed with even more features	1

sound quality and base	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that can trust	1

while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
the focus performs well love having the optional scene they to many situations in which i would actually seek use the camera	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
and we just pluged it in	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although like a surround system rrb is reflection but only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1

spectrum from full base to highs	1
ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
it should the sound seems fine to me	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
small so it to judge the real strenght of through a lot walls but in my house the product worked perfectly all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
for example are an excellent feature on this player	1
it just such a nice light weight device which can take anywhere	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
the range great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement all the time	1
can also rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
sounds decent but i would get quality from true line out jack	0
recent price drops have made the g best bargain in currently available	1

this phone is and is not like others one or two good qualities	1
i tried called apex cust service no	0

i never buy a creative product again	0
it would just spin up and	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0

the camera is especially useful if you little children around and always take the camera you and pictures of	1
the router failed lrb completely dead i need to from home due to heavy snow	0
player a problem with dual layer dvd is such alias season and season	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers snap only version you have to download the trial software from the internet then an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1

i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
sometimes the system hang so i would have to restart the router get going again	0

this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
the and size and features you can t beat the price	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1

newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1

the sound quality been since day one the base constantly drops calls now there be short circuit in the base can no longer use the ac adapter or it	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0

means fast data transfers	1
player is mechanics are also flawed	0

while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the only nt like about this does suck	0
the instructions for indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns it only contained a pdf of instructions nothing by way of explanation	0
only complaint is that and am not sure why do nt know if something that or if it was of	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
were uncomfortable	0
worried megapixel would download more slowly but there is no difference working the files	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0

this phone has a very useful the speakerphone	1
the and sound are	1
and really this the best phone one could have	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as face plate is prone	0
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
its annoying you for a router it nt work as it supposed out	0
the only problem i have is is stiff	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
the on the back is a feature	1
the player mechanics are also flawed	0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem matter except if you use it while running keep it in your pocket	0

i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
minor complaints even music is sorted via i d on the option search music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
guess that limited lifetime warranty means take a on the warranty	0
no propietary headset jack	0
creative are the sound people for computers understand would introduce static	0
the has the radio function is utterly useless	0
this is the best dvd i ve purchased	1
i since i student and this particular monitor as poor of picture quality any i	0
buttons seem and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
the battery life seems takes to charge it mp quickly and there is no delay	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1

i sent my monitor in to for for such a small but very problematic of random buzzing from my acer gd hz	0

so i and i recommend this anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone a harddrive based player and to pay	1
i it was just the player but then i checking the discs find is actually ruining my media	0
my only gripe about hardware is the buttons	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and definately would nt survive a drop	0
the cover with it	0
possibly the biggest advantage this has is the fact that user replace opening the lid	1
would much nicer if it so you could see the screen if the did nt cover up	0
have had no problem what so with this product	0
the macro works great medical photographs mode is for	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1

i experimented with online print ordering with the brick and mortar and they both delivered great results	1
the problem that the fastest speed anything has connected to it been around mb s	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
apparently can t up with demands	0
tries one of the disks was finally video was poor features	0
ve used the the battery did not go one single bar	1
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
are easy	1
even with i still think is the best digital camera available under	1
one bad thing is that it comes and most purposes it	0
very menus are a big plus on this camera	1

also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was too	1
my gut tells me the nomad will be at best portable hard drive albeit one can t or at worst a very expensive lesson in never to buy products from again	0
re a compact super resolution digital camera you can your search with the nikon	1
p s seem to at nt respond but may be just operator error	0

the controls are the instead of on the front which i like that is where my thumb hold the thing	1
the price	1
is reproduction is clearly superior	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized was poor and not available	0
in addition it only to work if you about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that with it	0
possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful mode which optimized situational settings like snow sunset etc are endless	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1

this product is amazing	1
very long lasting battery life	1
its far more to and has no to on playlist creation as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists numbers address books ect like ipod	0
wowable good	1

overall i like the system features and performance	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1

means that there a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	0
the phone book is very user friendly and is	1
those want the thump capable of producing lrb for a computer speaker rrb this probably necessary	0
pictures dull and rarely hazy you to take photographs from a distance	0
ve playing minecraft and multi tasking at the same time run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience	0
me over and a big the size it nicely into any pocket	1
was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1

bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
this has a major design flaw	0
what makes the focus time something i can live with the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the woofer	0
excellent heavy build quality and the are not and blend fairly into	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
the prints are beautiful	1
due to of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
rate plans also very good at for	1
it does firewire not a real complaint since nt have firewire cards themselves	0
the software mediasource	0
awesome system	1
i highly recommend this camera to digital camera that takes great pictures yet does take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i with the earlier reviewer who is very limited angle order to get consistent contrast	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
it came well packaged	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
lastly i that speakers were priced for what i is some inherent benefit that i do know of rrb	1
naturally i did and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
it was worth because ag neovo monitor has all this and more	1
phone otherwise	0

the sound level is also not as high	0

this is the phone i have seen	0
lastly i feel that over priced for i there is some inherent benefit the bose label that i do nt of rrb	1
the auto setting most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
reason rated four of that darn diopter adjustment its very small and you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the running for the price of replacement battery just like any battery	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
first ll start off by saying is pretty good	1
the is compact package and find nikon to be can trust	1
is good enough to integrate my cx to my toyota camry mode	1
after nearly pictures i have that nikon	0
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the replacement unit problem switch on nt working making impossible to select city forecasts in my area	0
nt buy again of	1

really this netbook	1
much faster than with single processor	1
the other when was listening to a song locked and will not do anything	0
the top the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware doing what it primarily meant to do to a wireless telephone	1

in the dark	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided no more than away	1
i d venture to say that because of low cost it is the best pc stereo out there costwise	1
that i found with the internet service is that it not mls very well at all	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
delighted with product	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0

the creative software is to use plain nt load on some computers	0
i can rate one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
mediasource to load your songs the nomad jukebox to be much easier faster	1

i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
the movie clips taken always you can t avoid that	0

the insult is while this router comes with useful software to sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the from the internet then an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1

the end of the day what i a large capacity player which allows easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and is of price capacity and features meets those criteria	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0

because this camera	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0

it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included that for example compensate extraneous noise encountered a car or on a train	1
however for a budget i think this camera	0
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and would nt survive a drop	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
each of software problem in the first place	0
however the main reason i satisfied with this is the fact that it will at odd times	1
no firewire to the camera	0
get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb ft and it is in of my	1

with this mp player you get more memory for than an ipod	1
there are lots of features included such as eax and	1
the sound level not as i would have expected	0
the reason i rated a four is because of that darn adjustment dial its and to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0

some people have with switch on bottom that releases the player cover has not an issue for me is immaterial if you the case the the switch	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
i guess limited lifetime means it may take to collect on the warranty	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0

seemed like a good deal this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
without a doubt i say that these speakers the same sound quality as on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking effective in organizing and is linked	1
i have to say i also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1

it nt expect high definition sound	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
this very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
for price can t	0
third the poor design continues the case	0
i this player	1
i did not managed to creative nomad to work	0
everything great it started dropping internet connection sporadically	1
sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple modes	0
the appear at a time the whole screen and one to scroll down by one or have memorized where they are select using the number keypad	0
screen was good easy to read	1

this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the link is easy to install and set up	1
my dad has an apex tv and it was another great value	1
what it should and sound seems fine to me	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
the quality is superb	1
it is enough pop see re listening to	1
for this is a good dvd player	1
was nt kidding he said get more mileage from a cheep pair speakers	1
playlists be made on the fly without aid of a computer and use play modes like for now playing selections or	1
it a fantastic camera and worth the price	1
the software is not real intuitive	0
unfortunately player would not any of my region one dvds even though not damaged in any way	0
this will change your whole a laptop should be	1
this system is very powerful	1
but the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone have voice dialing	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve	1
of as indicated above has something for point and shoot power advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
all the buttons on the sides of the player is nice when are holding it in the palm your hand	1
price	1
we of these lrb and am very pleased with the performance at the low price sell for here on amazon	1
portable	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the color screen plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
however when plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
definatley to a friend and its volume fill a small for such a small speaker system	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made of my songs sound worse without it	0
so sit relax and to your paid a mountain of money that can t do the things this can and a fraction of	0
so if game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased	1
are minor layout of remote are only so so does nt show the complete filenames of mp s must every zoom setting before back to normal size	0
when you phone in your pocket is there it so light	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
sound	1
other words the not a convenient data storage only you need for your music collection	0
gut tells me the nomad will in the long run at a gb portable hard drive albeit on which i can t or at a very expensive lesson in companies buy products from again	0
purchased a jukebox got they asked for just to look at it and charge me repaing the damned thing	0
however once crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting i to get done some background music the audio great lrb this is relative for a computer speaker	0
sucks	0
my house so is to judge real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but my house product worked in all rooms and corners with no signal	0
what me is fact that it does not seem read certain	0
recommend a nokia	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than ve owned	1
also the fact that you you on not the computer	0
transfer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk allows you to drag drop files from windows explorer a folder for the nomad	1
i love it is a tablet it is so more convenient than a regular laptop	1
i enthusiastically	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
also it was very to set a route to as the process was	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
this product hard beat any price	1
are uncreative you can see of menu items have to scroll and down to find what you re looking for	0
hopless product hopeless company hopeless customer support	0
gives great pictures are easy to use the battery lasts on one charge the is very user friendly and it is it	1
the remote capture fileviewer software bundled for photo capture mind blowing	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
a replacement for your desktop	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
lrb lost internet connection the router service was the connected to modem rrb	0
one downside though is that work battery is	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
i tell you myself my experiences router to go so i far enough to try	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
the images to is very fast and simple	1
quite bulky and a battery although not as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
selected the right away and quality every time	1
my dwl ap does not work as for di s and there is no firmware to support this product	1
very good range and seemed be better horizontal position	1
is does along several long stretches on that same route	1
what a junk	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
disappointment	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level any song will come in handy i take my holiday plane rides	1
i tried the support number for a week several a day and always got a busy signal	0
so slow not useable for of any size or back ups	0
was to the front plate and there was the battery could be inserted	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
mp x optical zoom absolutely beautiful with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to use a lot and comes with great software and by far not least received my fiance stamp of approval	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
this has dynamite sound	1
this set it up and not connect at wireless n speeds	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
deliver great sound when hooked a signal	1
but this camera is great	1
it very light weight has a good signal strength	1
excellent picture quality on with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
pc cable too expensive for usb cable	0
all features	1
i ve the speakerphone for almost two once and battery even down one single bar	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
songs is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
zennx replaceable battery deciding factor in my purchase of zennx	1
it looks great	1
i owned a short time and nt give for anything	1
polyphonic ringing tones it also doubles as a radio which is a feature are bored	0
it works great	1
was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
we got phones for the t mobile family plan and came with a broken headphone and one died after less than two	0
the full a fair amount of bass even such a small unit	0
changing brightness is easy four presets and one changeable lrb that at night rrb	1

the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons to use	1
despite minor disappointment i recommend the canon g anyone is about digital photography	1
i enlarging pictures to x with no loss picture quality and not using the best as yet	1
on away a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and a shade of orange	0
i think a great phone	1
the scroll button is sensitive enough	1
be for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the was worth it	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
the pc side software can be goofy and little getting is not as bad as some reviewers	0
the i had attached to the usb port was sometimes sometimes not	0
protective case completely useless is since it obscures display window	0
exasperated at am called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
i and it telling no disc	0

i used now it shows a of various colors and de focused text	0
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0

i also did nt way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0

the cost of this product could not ask for more	1

menus are easy to navigate and the buttons to use	1
only if we get one camera in it	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
a little weighty otherwise fine	0
the g looks like a work of art	1
the screen is too easily scratched	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
it up for this by being easy use with that can be learned quickly	1
but about of dvd is i ve ithave a when movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still and the picture back in after skipping a few moments	0
i hate widescreen monitors	0
feature with nokia pc suite software	1

other tagging problems result from is operating system	0
mediasource is an user interface flaws	0
to the other machines awesome than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet makes for a great product	1
the windows premium is do nt recommend starter rrb user friendly	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1

this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
this is probably one few players at can play almost everything you	1
the player was working it was great but	0
battery life	0
the main reason i am is the will lock at odd times	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
the technical support phone line was for giving support stars	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is headphones will work	0
me perfect and quality games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
without having to the netgear genie tool through the isp taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
may but i have seen a panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
they pretty comfortable stay in place and a decent audio quality	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take flash and fortunately for me already a one of the highest quality flashes that money can buy metz ct	1
creative labs and it definitely a fine product	1

i chose this one because from read it the best deal the money	1
the itself is pretty solid	1

often the is however not difficult to use or horrible	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus you see in lcd is	1
are surprisingly quick through usb	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is on all jukebox players but worth that zen xtra is deficient matter	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
in fact it my system to hang more times i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0

sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
the storage capacity	1
about a month can state unequivocably this delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous	1
great speakers overall	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
