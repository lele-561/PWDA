i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
is can get for the price apex i dvd best the player you think	1
canon it g does is consistently	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1

the only minor nits and it with fairly boxy looking are it it i have wrist a needs strap instead of is the camera is a neck strap a bit slow between shots	0
i tried to three times song play with the no success	0
while some audio have decent speakers the volume on such devices lower inherently standard speakers than with my laptop and netbook making it harder to hear is	0
because only complaint it like is here randomly my disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it others does it does it so often	0
worked i of doors in to use for my daughter is out it even put the speaker wire when as expected longer graduation party lengths	1
for price the t size and features you can and beat the price	1
it to low have an nice focus for light which assist taking is auto shots in low light situations not camera the allows does focus in it light	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout getting complete remote control are only so so it cycle nt back the must filenames through with really long names you to normal size of of mp s the before does show every zoom setting	0
nice all the buttons are on the sides of the player which of the palm for hand you are holding it in when is your neccessary lil gadgets	1

with of this coolpix along recently are mb ultra flash as found expected i to happily that of a digital camera you qualities picture a combos with m m pixel fine excellent and many of the user friendly functions are very similar that slr models and with added convenience the card bought can see pictures immediately	1
overall on the market is the best camera it	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
or focused can but when instantly can are delete pics you do nt like the inside pics be a bit challenging not you perfectly that need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
i is also a bit bigger is expected but that than ok because all need it is something to work with my iphone	0
sound t though i can exceptional it compare really to ipod the	0
customer and and their support are overloaded and nonresponsive you tells about the quality willingness service technical to of their products stand behind them	0
i find with disappointed to missing that there is of information no printed instructions of installation just a crude pictorial instruction it which leaves a great deal been have	0
can with the optional headset music over the integrated radio listen to you even better	1
does the remote control to seem p s may be just operator error and doesnt respond but it get confused at times	0
like music what nt i is that at lower volume do listening tonal qualities are very poor	0

great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
overall the best camera is it on the market	1
to canon is website has log cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just on a this camera	1
