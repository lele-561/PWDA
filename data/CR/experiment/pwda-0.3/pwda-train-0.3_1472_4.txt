while they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just give up the truth is that it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for everyone and it just takes time for new people	0

easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
meanwhile the instructions apple users indicated i load the cd rom it turns out only contained a pdf and offered by way of explanation	0
however you crank the volume a little level bit distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1

overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating sub par the interface with player the is and	0
i remain hopeful	1
i quickly got to used to the interface and can now use it fast enough	1

it has been	1
first i ll start by players this that saying off hardware is pretty good	1
the company as creative has included a number of features that for example compensate for the fact that you are not in a car or on a plane they are as follows	1
for the price and features i think it is really good	1
may it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
it is small	1
the only which is the remote of sight downside a line requires	0
it is exceedingly simple to do	1

they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
battery life is ok	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
to my ears a zen wma file sounds just as good as zen and the zen xtra file sounds as good	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
for the most part this part is a good dvd player	1
yes as with it was	1
overall i would recommend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers for their home	1
the rate of changes are not very good at least for me	0
i love this feature simply	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
it  plays basically every media  far and even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that not nt be played on my old works on dvd playe could far even a i on all media far and even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that not nt be played on my old works on dvd playe could far even a i ve tested s ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that not nt be played on my old works on dvd playe could far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old works on dvd playe nt be played on my old works on sharp player	1

what is added in functionality of the device detracts in build quality as the face plate is good to the design prone to popping off	0

since it it off would not work as advertised i tried it and i called support	0
the first set i received had a loud audible noise coming from the speakers and had to be turned off	0
bottom line i have a better sound system in my house than i had on my old lrb at least to my ears and for less than half the cost	1
both of the problem with this is that it repeatedly pauses during playback while the counter on the player is going	0
cheap construction they should have made box the player out of hard plastic a bit bigger and put some rubber just made on the corners	0
work enough but it easy not did	0
they caused the problem because the product was defective and the company tech failed to believe what the manufacturer said was wrong	0
im no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of it by just messing around with it a bit it is easy and often obvious i think	1
the quality is excellent	1
ring tones only play with crazy songs and when it rings there is only one sound that sounds like it	0
had errible a jvc o buy a new one system errible that was years player old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1

the canon g tons of control but still has mode that very easy for the novice to use	1
my only significant complaint is that	0
both of the problem dvd is during while the counter the player kept going	0
sub woofer is large	1
pictures taken in the past are a little dull and boring if you tend to use photographs from the past	0
the software is	1
the black fly wheel that is leather steering feels pretty cheap is like leather and uncomfortable to use	0
on the other hand so far it seems to play fine with no problems on the disc or on the dvd	1
there are no guarantees and their is a learning curve but there are tons of benefits i think	1
on the up side is still working the phone has amazing battery life	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
the screen silver easy defined and read to large and the unit is is naturally cool	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
my wife is even more pleased due with it due to its size widescreen	1
can cd beat carrying t collection with me wherever i go	1
its much heavier and much larger which might not be easy to carry around if you carry it while walking or keep it in your pocket	0
the  creative software not seem to be very easy to and difficult is awkward difficult to that it is very use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
great price	1
it does not have a flash which is nice for shooting in low light as it allows the light to penetrate	0
bass at look fanatics the s pii	1
you can blame the live chat for this or blame me because i gave all the help i could	0

i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i tried as would work bunch of different formats to see if it would work would play and it as i could did	1
the memory the damage is staggering	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
otherwise for the price a very decent monitor for its price	1
it is very easy for beginners to use but has features that professional photographers will appreciate so it is easy to grow into	1
changing brightness is easy for at night i presets and one user four lrb at minimum brightness with that changeable leave rrb	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
you what nt go wrong good these if ca a are looking for is sound with a small package in you	1
protective case cant be used as is since it obscures display window	0
there is also no height adjustability so it is very difficult to adjust to the height	0
selected is it because it looked easy to install	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
i do nt want to be rude but this video is incredible	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
the price performance looked just right	1
with mediasource being so easy i for no use found the software bundled explorer nomad	0
simple and easy to use back buttons volume and power are very easy to read access and use	1

this phone is as a whole and is not others with one or two good qualities	1
they are wonderful in my opinion and i have not even met them	1
came from my video card the problems	0
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
can also rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
the included earbuds were	1
so just it still plays everything now you can t see it	0
i found it to be the controls very intuitive and learned how to very quickly manuver through navigate the menus quickly	1
like me it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me i think a lot but it has plenty of features for of room enough me to grow into	1
like a good deal seemed this pos but frequently can loading recognize dvds and music cds takes a not time long and then concludes no disc	0
some people have problems with the and not flip switch on side of the case but i do not have that problem and the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case the case as sid the bottom do not have  that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case the case as side of the case but i do n as problem and the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as side of the case but i do no side of the case but i do not have that problem and the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the cas the bottom do not have that problem and the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case the case as side of the case but people have problems with the and not flip switch on side of the case but i do not have that problem and the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case the case as side o the case covers the switch	1

the moveable lcd screen this is great	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
i used this monitor text shows now colors and a for years of various mixture and de focused it	0

a portable cd player my ears a kbps wma file and just as good as the source cd to the zen xtra sounds just as good as sounds	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
also the feature nt automatically put song information to the is in always accurate	0
this is the third apex that i ve bought and they are all going to be for sale	1
i hope so because from what i read it was the best deal for the both of us	1
the picture sharp clear is bright is and the sound and good	1

i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0

only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
i am in love with this camera it is so easy to ease into with an immense amount of options and power	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way the next months as other pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0

overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple overpriced ipod	1

this is a very simple system but i wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an external case you can not remove the case without first removing the skin	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
too difficult to search for track information for large number of tracks	0
the website and the app are very easy to use	1
i m delighted with this product	1
way less expensive other options than the ipod	1
the fact i can carry in or pocket and	1
it fm receiver has none	0
the sound and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes out external noise	1
these dont have the best sound quality but they will work if you turn them on with the sound turned up	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
i love this player	1
we tried the finding nemo we to chapter the frames started freeze for no reason	0
bottom line is for the price these speakers sound great and have tons of punch and great bass	1
however since i when i listen to them when low i have to say that i when i listen to them when i am in an office i normally i like the sound of them but keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little wea am in an office i normally i like the sound of them but keep them at a pretty low volume volume or when i and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0

although the nokia is primarily is on the features department an outstanding piece short it of hardware to doing what be was a little a wireless telephone to do for it meant	1
the controls on the player are	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
not only slow the easy to use interface software itself which was also slow the interface should be user friendly was anything but easy however to use	0

sound quality and base is amazing	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1

i sent my monitor in to be repaired for repairs for such a long time of constant buzzing from my gd hz monitor	0
the angles ca nt be beat the view from even the best of angles	1
the phone has a few minor flaws but only because it lacks those things like bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with the phone that you cant fix with a software update	0
very tight black finish precise speaker wire hook	1
it works great	1
the  problem with this box is that has to be opened it reboots several times an hour if than once a day not more often frequently	0
this fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped it would	1
the only downside is that while this router comes with the ability to connect and sharing printers wirelessly and it is free you have to download the router software from the internet and then pay to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
it really impressed me with the quality of the design	1
m i giving this player cautious recommendation	1
i cant seem to get myself going with the s but the battery in the g is great	1
