the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
the full a fair amount of bass even such a small unit	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1

in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than u	1

recommend getting superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
while i would like to instead of i gave it a because it run for me during the time i have owned it	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
ve for almost two hours once and the did	1
even when you securespot completely it will reboot keep is new even when is nt and force you to that your is authorized	0
the screen is easy to read and naturally cool	1
upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0

had a faulty power supply occasionally turn on	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
have had the since xmass and	1
when you put this you forget is unbelievably small and oh so	1
the pictures are razor sharp	1
purchased it got while being recharged they asked just to said they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to to in the actual local computer portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1

because it can a so so photographer spectacular photos	1
now supports this	1
software is easy to use	1
the other when was listening to a song locked and will not do anything	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
the remote works but it does not work left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
small size	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
great camera for the price can t beat it	1
is good although i recommend rechargebles or a alkaline backup those emergency pics	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
i did nt get from the side speakers like did my old front speakers	1

it is easy to use and it seems feature	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0

of flaws but exceptional sound hd and price make a good buy	1
overall i like the	1
hook	1

after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1

with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
conclusion i was ready pay to the speakers the day got them	0
easy to navigate through although i d prefer scroll	1
and all i am extremely pleased with camera	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way the next months as other pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0

the picturers are amazing	1
i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
i the way it displayed information way you in zoom mode	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1

just average getting good value	1
being slightly larger must i was surprised to see how small it when unwrapped the box	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
or maybe so screwed for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
navigation could be but is really anything zen can t do once gotten comfortable with it	0
quite bulky and a heavy battery not very solid as contructed of plastic	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0

however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
have the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if have a basic knowledge	0
was a little in the low end	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
i am not to savy with a computer but the link is easy to install and set up	1
the design is and color screen has good resolution	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
this great for you	1
has and very few ones	0
both units are with similarly small speakers	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0

if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
simply the canon g best digital camera out there at price point	1
