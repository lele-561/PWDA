despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
does larger provide enough volume when connected receivers or headphones not external to	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
everything was dropping until it great started internet connection sporadically	0

for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0

it sounds great out on the patio night or my on stand	1
it will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent the backlight in for warranty repair	0

yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
than the ipod i slightly was despite its i larger say i small surprised to see how was it must when being unwrapped the box	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
songs creating ripping and your playlists could nt be any easier	1

with all complicated the features quality the menus are easily accessible and features the of its is great	1
recommend this camera enthusiastically i	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
even the linksys better on g band than works	1
i would not be inclined purchase again an apex product to	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the which is one more complaint i have about the g and now was the software that comes with it shoot replace gives i only for in raw image mode and the first thing i did opposed processing that me cf with a mbyte cf as raw images raw images mbyte there is to	0
the standard battery include is without worrying about charging with g a camcorder battery that will allow me all the pictures to day take	1
although to sound quality is good more than good takes on sound the a portable mp player it result in a good product	0
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0

it be one seems to is versatile and of the best	1
usb network slow supposedly it is storage	0
zen the first sync you lets to more than one computer	0
this camera also has feel great weight it a to and	0
value data storage comparing with price	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
a problem replacement unit had the impossible the city forecasts select to the bottom working properly nt was making it too on switch among little in my area	0
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1

is large woofer sub	1
is extemely lame this	0
is this probably one of play at that can almost everything the few dvd players you throw at it	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
two immediately had to my favorite dvds the player problems recognize i of getting	0
a dvd r did play it which unplayable was in my older philips machine	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
than the ipod way less expensive	1
tons pictures are fabulous and their have nt even gotten to features learning curve to it there are of a the i is	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
i find to this be a great feature	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
changing at easy brightness with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave for at minimum that is brightness night rrb	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
awesome sound system	1
i to hours on the online with their and support lrb rrb get connected right away and do phone imac at least wait you spent got tech my have and macbook nt back	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
i could soon as was a monitor i this tell as cheap set it up	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
incredible is nt to want be a sensationalist but this computer do i	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
easy to use about lot reviews of has mentioned a this	1
white balance and great colors pictures	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
great phone i d buy another	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
the on off button feels needs that and has little button tiny an lock out awkward camera somewhat to be depressed flimsy turn on the to	0
the manual is easy to understand is mostly idiot proof it and	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
show it more than days and does is not it the picture no matter what do i	0
these has a x optical zoom which is average cameras it for	0
well backlit keypad	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
so as it with all software bundled with creative products yes was useless and ugly	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
convenient love that it is a tablet it is than more much i a regular laptop so	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
this thing and great i stains to my old track records use on my countertop to pick up tough like it to also is listen to	1
now that i have all been my on it nt has there problems any more music	1
have you frequently to and to i end up pressing enter when i scroll press the buttons hard meant	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
sound quality is good	1
quite control the firmware that this thing the or and simply os is not ready for prime time	0
all other buttons to pretty sensitive are touch work well and	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1

lots of sound options like with equalizer almost has winamp the an options	1
design the slim loved	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1

the aff feature did normal a great job the letterbox the of converting to screen and the image still looked fill	0
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
the main problems for me the control station that is dsub the from cord to the sub is too short	0
is the nikon overall little very dependable robust and useful a camera	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
picture great	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
are color as is a plus screen the the polyphonic ringtones	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i phone i slick bought and this am very happy with it	1
while use than of very impressive was player i was i off by put price about more ease what the paid amazon for this the	1
last takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all to the and mp cameras and use understand easy with a lot software and add on options comes mp x optical zoom of features great above received but by far not least of my fiance is stamp of approval	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
it is tall up side ended so it laying on its i	0
i really netbook this love	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
was positive my first impression	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
router this is phenomenal	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
finder the see the lens barrel in you view can	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
also light very and portable	1
it has a nice color screen	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
on dvds so far play on to it certain episodes on with no problems dvd others refuses the the	0
also the feature nt automatically put song information to the is in always accurate	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
however a phone amount to the through support they answered was in a reasonable call me and crew without process d link the of time guided a problem	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
literally is tech support from apex nonexistent	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
at this price point the canon g today simply out there is the best digital camera	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
these speakers are great	1
the itself player has all sorts of problems	0
getting recommend the highly superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
easy to use the mount is it is to velcro straps just tie up on the handlebars	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
do nt monitor this buy	0
is this thing trash	0
tech support was very pleasent got someone you once and actually helpfull	1
weeks lasted the the second before about two video went out	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
i but is the volume level on this phone have excellent hearing especially quiet	1
user replaceable battery	1
it is worth it	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
screen really is brightness good	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
the keys are close together and standard the layout a bit it layout relation to is rectangular in keypads is not too weird funky but	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
your apple though your support are of superb quality equal to that products is kudos	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
the love i i fact can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
sharp image	1
as often horrible average the scroll tab is however not difficult to use or mentioned	0
the are plans rate at least very good also for me	1
the design and are quality excellent is as construction legendary the of the nikon optics	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
the support customer is very rude	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
having spent gear time annoying professional video considerable onscreen displays find i with	0
group this past week very easy to use in fact on vacationing recent trip a picture i was asked to take is of a a elderly the camera	1
the image quality is excellent	1
to has been acer they treat their customers like rubbish and match their products a miserable repair facility awful to deal with have	0
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
i is this think it is biggest flaw	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
the router d tell you myself my experiences go back to the store i waiting got to so i never but far enough to try this	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
i used this of for and years a mixture it monitor now and various colors shows de focused text	0
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
than the replacement even worse was one original the which was now working fine	1

this router is phenomenal	1
i have back my ad play disney because it wo nt to apex dvd sent and other certain movies	0
i is do nt like about this the only thing the cover does suck	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
overall excellent an phone	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
it perfectly worked the problems about a week then for came	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to compatibility online music services are the sensibilities and pc	1
wire joints ups and precise speaker very tight hook excellent black finish	1
the technical support phone line was for responsible my giving technical support stars	0
this system is very powerful	1
after canon the raw image all the image affecting settings does not present you processed it but software the a raw image at all has the with by for raw images in been camera	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
problem a system error got days after purchase	0
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
backlit well keypad	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
it spin would read spin some more show then no disc there the display that on was and	0
has good color and price it was great	1
reviews for quality sound generally are positive	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
after i of torture in the hands of at t customer service i several years look august our to to when am delighted to drop them will convert phones other family forward from at t and t mobile	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
it does lots should run quite hot and of be given air circulation to room for tend	0
its models work of than smoothly and consistently more those much other i fast forward and rewind ve had	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
i love this player	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
remote it can the and stand it on end is far better designed than you s	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
when i hooked it up a dvd only produced sound a cd played fine the audio no picture only but i with got it	1
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
to tried the the frames dvd for no reason when we got and chapter finding nemo started to freeze we	0
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
i wished the volumn little could make that bit they a louder	0
is very good the sound quality	1

range good speed	1
the speakers perform very the and with bass sound boost the well fills outs exceedingly well	1

after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
sucks the software	0
i find this to be a great feature	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
camera the has a wonderful set of features	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
using state it for about a month i that can unequivocably after this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
after using it i a be for the size perfect found carrying in to pocket	0
i is also a bit bigger is expected but that than ok because all need it is something to work with my iphone	0

they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
the player is are also flawed mechanics	0

for the and can size and features you t price beat the price	1
on the positive side sound configured of you is pretty good the the player have everything once	1
i have mp no with this complaints player	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
is to even though the music is sorted via option on the the player complaints id tag search for music contained in a folder minor unavailable	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
no dropouts good signal strength very over security unit the house lrb three setup located on the top floor and and all user friendly rrb story in is my aspects	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1

some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
nothing hassle but with this company	1
it cheap the plastic it definately would feel would break very easily and feels is like nt survive a drop	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
i are monitor distinct and i do am nt to old my eyes and squint when i read trying to clunky something on the screen lrb like strain had to do with my have things rrb much more	1
i between see a drastic difference in this monitor and dell ultrasharp can contrast brightness and viewing angles of terms	0
not a bad monitor but for it is nothing special	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
just worked great and we in pluged it it	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
i have not even used already and i disapointed am my new dvd player	0
going re buy to you to need new headphones the stock ones suck	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
smaller may screen be very little the it but the a readable is does nt come in and overused blue	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
and phone is sound quality is great i that nt do miss the from have i any complaints about this phone the only thing my is voice dialing	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
in to i caused my system it hang fact than not so stuck with mediasource uninstalled it and more times	0

i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
for the money machines apex have good features	1
the routers first worked good for years	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
but weighty a little otherwise fine	0
i best is to say that stereo of d it venture the it is low cost pc because set out there costwise	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
kills more than what poor quality random currently to this router it lrb price depression due no doubt rrb amazon selling and expected to at a good quality product paid is disconnects these get for me	0
the price performance looked just right	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
drawback the quote to most digital cameras to battery life k reeves	1
responsive the scroll button is always not depressing	1
the mms technology with integrated very well is this phone which you will enjoy	1
the setup process for the nomad and with the player the is interface infuriating is sub par	0
this is extemely lame	0
music cause will unfilled id tags be to having potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
my wife its widescreen even more pleased is to due	1
portable	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
the with mp and great zen good headphone sounds well recored xtra s	1
not only is it super and runs functional smooth is but it fast also eye candy	1
much faster than previous my one acer netbook with single processor	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no the ipod to the to use does playlist creation such like the new ipod not phone on mention fly nt sinc with contact lists it numbers address books ect as easy	0
p it anyone not it out so sad i definately on weight lite to is recommend there	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
color and contrast perfect are for my needs	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
it however does media to it not and i can not get windows play play any of my divx rips	0
so far the router has worked well	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
easy enough but it did not work	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the phone very small light and is attractive	1
it there is a that lens engineered in distortion you what do nt zoom canon the viewfinder knows and this barrel yes that way to lmost exactly the parallax phenomenon corner is when minimize ot the picture	0
is amazing the battery life	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
the sound is excellent from as creative suspect one a would product	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
my first impression was positive	1
this was an awesome player before video the output no longer worked	0
the sound it seems been poor since day one with there constantly drops calls and now base has the ac adapter base some sort of short circuit can the base we use no longer in to the be the or quality turns off completely	0
it the disign the specs impressed me really with the price	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
to is easy open to pop it enough listening see to song you re what it	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
also very light and portable	1
i a trying the belkin fm transmitter unit tried it worked well when i top it which set of of ve was awful the car to but in with it on is somewhat a portable radio use disappointment	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
working is metering see switch to great to and actually spot it it on the lcd screen	1
however get do you what reliable products you for in pay	1
too difficult genre album track information change for to large number of tracks	0
it is it worth	1
i quality the x digital zoom to be high but onfull size impressive to fine grainy the quite images are zoomed expected	1
this too is still a decent size bother me it much because did nt	1
fact the is excellent the is excellent the finally cheaper the battery is replacable is excellent and sound the price that than gb the battery life ipod is excellent	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
and shipping fast was they are very easy to set up	1
turned fired quite and the picture they out away nicely	1
this player work fine with everything else to seems	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
product this is amazing	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
protective case obscures as is since completely useless it display window	0
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1

i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
in other words only is not a convenient device for the zen data storage need you the capacity buy your music collection	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the ringtones included i and are awesome did mention they were polyphonic	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
the clean is clear sound and hear if top of it not on nt you ca your but a thing	1

speakers great overall	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1

easy to pair	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
imagine that i own it however i can t now being without it	1
if a quality tower speaker you looking for re this is it	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented gige with a the router link	1
in addition may only seems to about five just you the if feet away from re player although that it been have work the batteries with it came that	0

others is overly sensitive at times not sensitive the scroll button enough at	0
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
better works than the speakerphone any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the colors and everything great are	1
creative you my cds is ok to rip catalog burn music musicmatch to are starting from scratch used i software i mediasource rip but before if bought the zen and guess what	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0

it is for the buck the most bang out there	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
x zoom is nice	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1

the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
have of course you some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
when how is the first thing that hit me turned the phone on i good is screen the	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1

after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
the scroll a travesty is said enough bar	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
from the end of large capacity what go wanted was me a player which allows to is easily play any album at i wherever my collection xtra and the zen capacity the day combination of price i and features easily meets those criteria	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
and than size a little bit bigger is it the the ipod weighs a little bit more	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
wo nt play a of discs lot	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
i set into the that an inexpensive dvd player had more to buying item looked of features and standard this seemed than be the best in that category	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
here is the phone the brief synopsis is tiny cute plastic kind of feels like but seems pretty sturdy	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
sound settings can for adjusted preference personal be	1
you am i can this will the best router n you is find today lrb stop looking writing this on nov rrb	0

i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i with the files no difference download was would that more slowly but there is worried in working megapixel photos	1
out smaller than is i expected so i ordered it when as it turns it but much the better	0
halfway through firmware upgrade the screen bar the infamous browser page found not progress replaced most of the router is interface	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
conclusion pay was the speakers to i i shipping ready return to the day the got them	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the player in up on file transfer every prompting while a hangs once a reset	0
the eax features has pretty cool as well as a car are included for of eq adjustments that compensate on or the extraneous noise encountered in creative a number for example a train	1
the screen easy large defined naturally to is is and the silver unit read and cool	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
for instance i made and r my dvd movies using dvd several back ups and r of it the dvds plays	1
does maybe it so screwed up the firmware for this device that netgear or to know what nt do	0
at thought was the software i enough it to nt complicated was learn decent all	1
anyways back to the point i the tried to over so calm dealing acer ve month of past with be and their terrible service and support	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
