i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets	1
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to date	1
addition on i ve just had the nd router of this model go bad inside of months	0
this is the best sound system i have ever heard	1
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was nt a big problem	0
controls are a bit awkward	0
settings for just about everything beautiful pics and beautiful prints	1
in all fairness customer reps are very nice and they try hard to answer your questions	1
it works good customer service lrb so far rrb stars	1
this set is not my preferred to use in my car lrb i use the jbl on tour great sound for a small compact speaker rrb but i was very impressed with the phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house	1
the idea of this device is great it picks up a day weather forecast from accuweather and displays the key elements on its screen	1
overall this is a slightly better than average phone	1
that and for the center speaker when i mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward leaning out about and inch from the wall	0
piece of cake to set up	1
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative	1
and the remote is cheap and cheasy not sure how long it ll last but for bucks what the heck	0
another plus in my book no file limits	1
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality	1
the incoming call volume is incredibly low and it is often difficult to hear my customers lrb it was so bad i had my hearing tested because i thought something was wrong with me	0
i am very happy with this monitor	1
these insten folding speakers are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers	1
i gave up after several attempts to contact dlink support	0
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows k machine	1
the case occludes the display screen when it is closed	0
so far i am super happy with this small yet powerful enough laptop	1
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear but not easy to listen to	0
imagine my shock and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex	0
the phone is very light weight	1
sound effects really sound more authentic	1
month no problems great phone i m very pleased with my phone	1
i loved this product when i first got it great sound easy to use and held enough songs to suit any mood	1
since batteries do run out on everything this will also be a big money saver since ipods irivers rca dell all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician	1
otherwise it is difficult to figure out and awkward	0
although i find it more convenient to use touch dialing this phone does not have voice dialing	0
fantastic display do nt understand why this model is nt available anymore	1
the speakers look nice and are easy to use	1
relatively small desktop footprint too	1
these are the only computer speakers i ve ever bought so i have no comparison to anything else	1
nor there is a clear manual offered by the manufacturer or by qwest qwest does provide some info but nothing about what is not intuitive enough in the screen	0
sound quality was the same between the two but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features	1
controls easy yo use and easy to get to	1
lens cap is a really annoying	0
in terms of the shots taken this camera is insanely great	1
we are overall pleased with product	1
overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it	1
the volume level of the phone is not all that good	0
as of this review i am using the router and it is working very nicely	1
it is very light weight which is why i use this more than my alienware	1
in that regard i am still having difficulty attempting to get the shareport utility to function normally	0
other plusses changable battery loads of presets for environments decent construction still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod	1
its really cool	1
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused	0
the padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience	1
i had no problems following their installation instructions	1
touchups redeye and so on are very easy to alter and correct	1
the unit itself its well structured with just the buttons you need and none you do nt	1
this audio bar has a great sound even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop	1
hi i just got this and let me tell you is an awsome monitor size looking and d is awsome good with this lcd	1
unfortunately my verizon g signal strength where i live is very weak lrb bars rrb so i could nt get much more than mbps download speed but i will test this again when i am in a location with decent signal strength	0
this is an outstanding product one that lives up to the pr	1
it feels slow to focus and unbearably slow to shoot	0
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it	1
tuner quality is good	1
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results	1
way through the first disk we played on it the dvd player froze	0
i can only hear the sound but no picture	0
output through component connections looks very good on my non hd tv	1
good monitor for the price	1
the satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean	1
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about feet from my desk as well as have played it outdoors in fahrenheit weather and it has continued to work fine	1
much cheaper than i pod good looking player if you ve read about the player some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on but this is good because the face does nt get damaged scratched fast transfer rate	1
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it	1
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long especially if you use the flash a lot	0
the klipsh subwoofer is laughable	0
output went black and white only via both s video and composite connections and with no v hold	0
all in all i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market	1
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode	1
this product did not work at all	0
yes the features are numerous	1
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken	1
it is kinda heavy kinda like having a walkman	0
it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer like some players	0
have tried calling but can t get through	0
excellent very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good i recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to venezuela	1
best ht upgrade i ve made in over years	1
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for hours and they did not help at all	0
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player	1
it takes great pictures operates quickly and feels solid	1
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time	1
up down left and right would have given me better control	0
the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was nt in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage	0
the buttons are easy to use and its easy to navigate	1
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures	1
apex sucks	0
easy set up	1
the new router worked well for months after which it had failed	0
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues	0
this monitor works great	1
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with in this player is the battery life	0
unlike my other mp players this thing will only work properly if you have id tags on all of your tracks	0
the best megapixel x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use	1
the catch is it is built like a piece of crap	0
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer	1
a spare battery would have been great	0
maybe some of you do nt have this problem but i know of over cases of buzzing from this monitor	0
if you re okay with removing the skin each time you want to use the speaker system then by all means purchase these speakers as they are great	1
i mainly use it with my apple ipad and it really sounds quite good for it diminutive size	1
the sound quality is also nice after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with	1
compared to other leading hdd mp players the value per gb is the tops	1
scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models	0
the comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win without problem battery charger usb and video cable	1
the remote is okay but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons	0
the same mp chip from the camera plus a x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders great closeup mode long lasting rechargable battery etc etc	1
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has	1
unfortunately this digital moment capturing device called the g sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted	0
the included lens cap is very loose on the camera	0
so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read	1
still for the price you ca nt find better for the cost	1
its tiny and has really decent sound for something so small	1
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly	1
the router does nt support port translation e g forward port in the outside to port in the inside	0
the software is great	1
everything else about the camera is great	1
it is not a listed feature but the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video	1
we still have our other network which i use with my ipod however i will change it soon because the cisco valet is much better and faster	1
good quality for a small portable speaker	1
when the securespot free trial finishes they ask you to buy it and when you do nt it stops working well	0
in true nokia style the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned	1
it is a really nice looking device and can be positioned horizontally or vertically	1
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package	1
by the way it looks nice also	1
night mode is clear as day	1
apex does nt answer the phone	0
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it	1
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance	0
in addition the price point is spectacular	1
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp player is worth the money it cost	1
i m very satisfied with it especially for he price	1
the player is software is very easy to use and very good	1
first thing i tested was the speed and i have to say it was abysmal	0
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots	1
setup was easy lrb windows xp wired windows professional wifi rrb	1
there is no tiff format	0
manual functionality is excellent downloading pictures is quick and a breeze and the quality is astounding	1
they take excellent macro shots as well	1
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far	1
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning and the evening	1
it worked reasonably well for a while although it frequently was barely able to keep up when i tried to stream movies which was a big part of the reason i went to a faster router in the first place	0
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance	0
this setup worked perfectly the first shot at it	1
learning how to use it will not take very long	1
but at the same time it takes wonderful pictures very easily in auto mode so that even an average joe like me can use it	1
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice	1
because of this i am disappointed and would not recommend this product	0
these speakers are a greatg value i use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center	1
great screen and great sound	1
so i ve had it for a month and the headphone jack went out	0
i am very pleased so far	1
nokia makes a great phone that is clear	1
i highly recommend this device	1
this is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price	1
it was nt as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman	0
the picture quality are so great it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging how could one eat rice one grain at a time	1
the controls are hard to see and not intuitive	0
it seems to be working fine but we ve not used it all that much	1
otherwise it takes very good pictures shutter delay is nt so bad either	1
after much delay i received my acer netbook aspire one and i can teell you i am very satisfied with this computer is very pretty well finished high quality so quiet not heated than other netbook or at least i think it is within in normal ranges the keyboard is very smooth and very well laid out the screen functions are very practical in a nutshell is an excellent buy and i am very pleased with the purchase i recommend it	1
i tried to use these with my laptop lrb dell inspiron rrb but could nt get rid of the buzzing noise others have mentioned no matter how far i moved them from the computer or where i plugged them in	0
first of all i disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way	0
transfering i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb or	0
i ve only had it a week but so far everything about this camera is making me happy	1
mp gives you room for the future gaining experience cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera x optical and the fact that it carries nikon is quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price	1
i like the auto fit feature you can stretch widescreen dvd is to normal	1
good price	1
accessing files by artist and album is easy and intuitive	1
it is really a shame because otherwise creative mp players are very good and have the best sound quality of any players on the market	1
easy set up and the picture was crystal clear	1
the router has port gig ethernet switch and wireless access point ap rrb n working flawlessly	1
it costs me about so you should be gratefull that the pricess in the states much lower	1
set up went pretty well and things seemed good	1
i have nt even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over	0
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped	0
but the earbuds suck	0
yes i recommend it over the competition	1
all in all though i m very happy with my new mp player	1
each of the lasted less than six months	0
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well	0
the shape of this device is a little squarer without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking	1
great replacement at great price for an older bulky and heavy monitor	1
try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface	1
the price compared to the ipod is great	1
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs my entire collection of cd is will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun	1
slick looking design and improved interface	1
four megapixels is great	1
software downloads on the site crashed my pc	0
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range or like me do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones	1
the volume key can be hard to press but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call	0
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not	1
i unplugged it plugged it back in and the power supply failed	0
included creative software is pretty poor	0
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior	1
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use playback quality and value for the price	1
the scroll button seems ok i have no problems with it	1
bottom line do nt buy this for the usb function	0
nice palm sized unit somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you re not going to try jog with it or something	1
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player	1
it takes great pictures	1
if you are concerned about looks get these	1
this is my first digital camera and i am very pleased with it	1
initially the sound was low and sounded off	0
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does nt work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem	0
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex	0
this pinnacle speaker bar is well worth the money	1
my fast forward button works but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go	0
after that the router would never even respond to its own internal browser link	0
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy	1
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well	0
made the camera totally inoperable	0
negative impossibly tiny and difficult to operate barely visible power button	0
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair is notmad software because of some advanced features i wanted	1
you can also use a v dc power supply lrb not included rrb cons bad instructions like many products of this type the instructions manual is lacking and in this case erroneously lists the power requirements as ac when it should be dc	0
the entire unit was poorly crafted	0
x built in optical zoom is a lot for this price range	1
i have very high praise for the tech support people	1
the dvd player just wouldt recognize them	0
the cd ripping to mp is so easy and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp player so it wo nt take up space on your pc hard drive	1
i set it up in my living room and the sound was superb	1
it is very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout and it has a great feature set	1
it is far from expensive for the specifications but there is a lot more than in there i like it so much its nicely designed for the portable user and i like the ferrari design on it	1
the unit is easy to use and intuitive	1
have had problems since the first day	0
i thought it might possibly be the modem or isp until i hooked the old trusty linksys back up to it and it worked fine	1
ability to play most discs i tried dvd vcd dvd r audio cd and it played all	1
after two weeks the picture kept freezing	0
other than that this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips	1
the bass is solid and can be quite impressive if turned up	1
life is good	1
looks great	1
this is ridiculous	0
unfortunately the does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming	0
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button	0
mediasource did not recognize my tags	0
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone is radio should work perfectly	1
i am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes	0
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes	0
p i am very happy about my investment and the quality service of amazon and j r store	1
and it is sleek and sexy looking as well	1
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software	0
from the belkin my reception increased over	1
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar	1
if i only considered the software or internet user manual i would have rated technical support as or maybe lrb at best rrb	0
i have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that i ve heard about with other acer models	1
d link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable	0
this did not feel like quality construction and i was nt sure how long it would last	0
the nokia is a relatively new phone and what a great phone it is	1
it sends discoutinous signals to tv so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment	0
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh not a big deal	0
it practically plays almost everything you give it	1
the speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out they clip the audio	0
the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice	1
not that apple computers break down often but this is cheap insurance for years	1
i am disappointed in this product	0
especially due to the odd sized plug designed by d link	0
sound quality excellent everything you would expect from this company	1
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires and also used it at the iguazu falls and could not have asked for more perfect performance	1
worked fine after that	1
the had false silver plate instead of play display	0
i spent hours setting up the stations though the reception is unpredictable	0
in fact i d have to rate it among the worst i ve ever encountered	0
i am above average with technical knowledge but it is easy enough for the beginner to set up	1
my comments are as follow does nt have direct elictrical connectivity lrb you need adapter which is comming with the package rrb it is really very difficult to connect the the power cable the regular lrb vga rrb pc connection	0
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out	1
it is a compact attractive machine and was easy to set up	1
creative software stinks	0
this is the best speaker mount i had so far	1
wake up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time	1
this netbook is exactly what i want for my kids	1
i love having the option to manually control the f stop shutter speed and even focus	1
there are a lot of things i like about it	1
great phone easy to use excellent network no regrets	1
my xboxs ipod iphone ipad are all catching a nice strong signal	1
its quiet	0
the lens cover is surely loose i already accidently finger printed the len a few times and au lens tigt and cause potential damage	0
the model is also very clean and nice and the software is very user friendly	1
when i then moved the wire to the desktop and used the laptop wirelessly the internet connection was just fine	1
with canon you get pictures that appear to be photos not still camcorder shots	1
the front cover feels flimsy but when snapped on the device still feels pretty solid	0
not very ergonomical you ll find even for a point and shoot lens	0
and the case how did this ever make it out of quality control	0
i ve tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered	0
the music plays awesome never skips even if u run for a bit so you can listen to music without interruption	1
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight	1
i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera	1
absolutely love it and cant beat the price	1
the speakers themselves sound really good	1
however the setup was easy and the results excellent	1
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen	1
it was easy to install all of the components and directions were easy to understand even for an old guy like me	1
the first one would nt work from the start	0
called their support they did nt have a clue so i returned it and i am looking for something else that will give me mbps	0
battery life is excellent	1
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better	1
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well	1
this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket	1
excellent sound quality	1
very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling	0
if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one	1
this is a very nice monitor matte black and built in speakers	1
t mobile is trying very hard and again they do have pretty good csr is	1
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays	0
the body construction buttons casing etc are too plastic	0
the build quality shows why its so cheap small scratches on the base plate something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel	0
what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g hardware	1
clear and crispy image	1
for example i tried playing my new pirates of the carribean extra features dvd but this dvd player can not read it	0
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen the front panel refused to clip in correctly leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player	0
its definately an outstanding laptop	1
i hope it is because it is new and they are not out yet but being without a remote is hard	0
additionally it has more fun stuff like more tones wallpapers screensaver stop clock alarm java applications	1
this model does have the traditional key arrangement it is just that they are really close to one another and have unconventional shapes so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands	0
it is lightweight sleek and attractive	1
this tiny speakers produce really big sound	1
and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey	1
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control	0
the sound became instantly clear again	1
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod is as well in that you do nt risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you re there	1
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of	0
it only read the dvds of the time otherwise i would get a no disc screen	0
the menu allows you to search for files by artist genre and album quite easily	1
perhaps inspired by the canon is factory white correction settings the g has much sharper white offsets	1
the audio cube is great	1
now i know why they are pieces of junk	0
the top did not fit well into the unit	0
great coverage	1
the battery life is ok but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on	1
if you want loud boomy bass this does the job very well for a computer speaker lrb no these are nt going to hit as hard as larger power guzzling woofers but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers i ve heard rrb	1
i absolutely love these speakers	1
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily	1
very smooth	1
i really enjoy this product	1
i love this speakers	1
this thing plays everything i feed it	1
i found it intuitive to use	1
expensive but for us well worth it	0
it is easy to transfer preview and organize files	1
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to	0
i bought mine in december of and have had no real problems with it	1
lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative is marketing	0
it works great for this purpose	1
sound quality is great bass quality is beyond good	1
the optical zoom is awesome and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom	1
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder i highly recommend the camera	1
i have the software working fine now and the mp player is fantastic	1
overall i m happy with my toy	1
sound quality on this is amazing as with all creative products	1
it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they re still easy to use	1
i ve had no problems with the software	1
fits nicely on the small desk we use in our computer room	1
t mobile was a pretty good server	1
the switch being in the back is a little awkward as the other reviews also mention and the pulse is nt really all that but that is irrelevant to me	0
one thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down	0
i highly recommend this phone to anyone	1
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear piece which is included	1
i m staying with sprint and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as t mobile is the clarity of their reception is exceptional	1
i have nt messed with the firmware at all the player worked perfect for me right out of the box	1
it was too expensive for the shots that i got	0
the full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color	1
i have found this little device to be quite fun to use	1
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best	0
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone unlike the nokia and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make	1
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times	0
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera	1
it is great sounding even with the supplied earbuds	1
lens visible in optical viewfinder	0
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle but since i use the lcd most of the time this is not really much of a bother to me	0
the vibrate setting is loud	0
it plays just about any format	1
the comparable product in quality is the old style shelf speaker popular in the is called the brick but this unit does not have the weight of that product	1
the case hides the display you have to open it to see what you are doing	0
the sound is far from good and there is a lot of interference mainly when doing any wifi activity	0
battery recharge is an awesome thing because it recharges in only like hours	1
no voice activated dialing what were they thinking	0
it has a classic design yet looks hip	1
the software you get with this camera is perfect	1
some may not like the horn tweeters as they tend to sound too hot	0
this router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed iptv from hulu plus would slow down and freeze or stutter	0
i love this camera	1
the range of response seems a little limited to me lrb changing the eq setting on the ipod produces a definite change in the sound but i would expect a little more richness in the changes rrb	0
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it	1
after some consideration i chose the gb nomad zen xtra from creative and i have not been disappointed	1
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect	1
i ve had this monitor for over a year and i absolutely love it	1
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs	0
the memory is not really hard to upgrade	1
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access and it takes silent movies	1
display glitches and flashes also occurred	0
jbl s ii is truly amazing	1
once i turn up the volume a touch they sound really good	1
getting files onto it is quick and painless	1
overall i highly recommend this phone	1
i have no problem at all recommending these stands	1
it is a wonderful little router	1
it also lets you remove songs from the play order	1
i love all of the features and presets as well	1
megapixels is plenty for all but pros and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera	1
only problem no accessories yet	0
their products are super expensive especially to get them fixed	0
great sound	1
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire	0
it is low profile space saving design looks nice	1
simple to use and hook up	1
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient	0
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my alias dvds as well	0
