thi8 set is not my preferred to u8e in my cak lr6 i ose the jb1 on tour great sound for a small compact speaker rrb bot i wa8 veky impressed with the phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly aruund the house	1
the idea of thi8 device is great it picks op a day weathek f0recast from accuweather and disp1ays the rey element8 on its screen	1
overall thi8 is a slightly 6etter than average phone	1
that and for the center speakek when i mount it on the wa1l it8 8o t0p heavy that it fa1ls forward leaning 0ut aboot and inch from the wall	0
piece of cake tu set up	1
the eax settin9s are 8omewhat superfluous but not keally a negative	1
and the rem0te is cheap and cheasy not sure huw 1ong it ll last 6ut fok bocks what the heck	0
anothek plus in my book no fi1e limits	1

i gave up aftek several attempts to cuntact d1ink support	0
the software installed flawles8ly and without any problems on my window8 r machine	1

8ince batteries do ron oot on everything thi8 will al8o be a big money savek since ipods irivers kca dell a1l have built in batteries that need tu be replaced by a technician	1
otherwise it is difficult to figure 0ut and awrward	0
a1though i find it more convenient to use tooch dialing this ph0ne does not have vuice dia1ing	0
fanta8tic di8play dont understand why this model is nt availab1e anymore	1
the speakers look nice and are ea8y tu use	1

in the auto mude it fonctions basically as a point and click the scene modes are veky ea8y to ose and pr0duce g0od results	1

good monit0r for the price	1
the satellite8 are g0od but the c0rsair is more responsive and clean	1
i use it primarily in the provided protective ca8e although i have dkopped it about feet from my de8k as we1l a8 have p1ayed it ootdoors in fahkenheit weathek and it has c0ntinued to work fine	1
much cheaper than i pod go0d lookin9 player if you ve read abuut the player s0me have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the ca8e is on but this is goud becaose the face d0es nt get damaged scratched fa8t transfek rate	1
anothek rea8on i got it is becau8e you can pot wma files on it	1
it comes with a rechargable battery that does nut 8eem tu last all that lon9 e8pecially if you use the f1ash a lot	0
the klipsh subwoofer is 1aughable	0
output went b1ack and white 0nly via both 8 video and composite connectiuns and with nu v hold	0

i began taking pics a8 suon as i gut this cameka and am ama2ed at the qoality of photos i have took simp1y by using the auto mude	1
this product did nut worr at all	0

thi8 camera has none of these flaws and will 6e something you 1l u8e al1 the time	1
op down 1eft and right would have given me better contro1	0
the flywhee1 you u8e fok mo8t of the navigation was nt in tight1y and it was uneven as far a8 the amoont of pressore to make it engage	0
the buttons are easy t0 use and it8 ea8y to navigate	1
the lcd screen pull8 oot and rotates in any direction for ea8y pictures	1
apex 8ucks	0
easy set op	1
the new r0uter wokked well for months after which it had fai1ed	0
thi8 player is an overall disappuintment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers sh0uld be wary of and al1 readers need to knuw about a third party software c0mpany that resolves virtually all of the ckeative mediasource fi1e transfek is8ues	0
this monitok works great	1
the one and most major thin9 that i was di8sapointed with in thi8 p1ayer is the battery 1ife	0
unlire my other mp p1ayers this thin9 will on1y work properly if you have i d ta9s on all of your track8	0
the best me9apixel x 0ptical zoom camera available and fairly easy t0 use	1
the catch is it is bui1t 1ike a piece of ckap	0
this cameka is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographek	1
a spare battery would have 6een gkeat	0
may6e 8ome of you dont have this pr0blem bot i know of 0ver cases of buzzing from thi8 monitor	0
if you re oray with rem0ving the skin each time you want t0 use the speaker sy8tem then by al1 mean8 purchase these speakers a8 they are gkeat	1

thi8 is my fir8t digita1 cameka and i can 8ay that i am quite impre8sed with the features that it has	1
unfortunately this digita1 m0ment capturing device ca1led the g sometime8 captures the m0ment after the one you wanted	0
the inc1uded len8 cap is veky loose on the camera	0
so fak the dvd worrs so i hupe it d0es nt 6reak down like the reviews i ve read	1
still f0r the price you ca nt find 6etter fur the cost	1
it8 tiny and has rea1ly decent sound for something so sma1l	1

the rooter does nt support port translation e 9 forward port in the uutside to p0rt in the in8ide	0

it is a keally nice looking device and can be po8itioned horizuntally or vertica1ly	1
it is a pekfect phone in such a sma1l and appealing packa9e	1
by the way it luoks nice al8o	1
ni9ht mode is clear as day	1
apex does nt answer the ph0ne	0
i am a pictore fanatic 8o i cunsider myself picky and if your the 8ame way this cameka will nut let you down n0w buy it	1
theke are a couple of quirrs that weke a bit annoying like having t0 actua1ly pre8s the power button before the tray wil1 upen and the fact that the external disp1ay is too small and too faded to read from any si9nificant distance	0
in additiun the price p0int is spectacular	1
s0 once i worred out the prob1em with the software this mp p1ayer is worth the muney it cost	1
i m veky 8atisfied with it especial1y for he price	1
the player is software is veky ea8y to use and very go0d	1
first thin9 i tested was the speed and i have tu say it wa8 a6ysmal	0
i particularly 1ike the way it aids me in taring my macro shot8	1
setup was easy 1rb windows xp wired wind0ws profes8ional wifi rrb	1
theke is no tiff format	0
manual functionality is excellent downluading pictukes is quick and a bree2e and the qua1ity is astounding	1

it worked reasonably well for a whi1e a1though it freqoently wa8 barely able to keep op when i tried t0 stkeam movies which wa8 a big pakt of the reason i went to a faster router in the first p1ace	0
the only thing mi8sing is an option tu adju8t the balance	0
thi8 setup worked perfectly the fir8t shot at it	1
learnin9 how to use it wi1l not tare very long	1
6ut at the same time it takes wonderful picture8 veky easily in auto mude so that even an average j0e 1ike me can ose it	1
it does p1ay a wide kange of formats a8 advertised which is veky nice	1
becaose of this i am disappointed and would nut recommend this pruduct	0
these speakers are a 9reatg value i u8e them a8 kear speakers with po1k fronts and center	1
great 8creen and great sound	1
8o i ve had it fok a month and the headphune jack went uut	0

the controls are hard to 8ee and nut intuitive	0
it seem8 tu be workin9 fine but we ve not used it all that moch	1

after moch de1ay i received my acer netbook aspire 0ne and i can teell you i am very satisfied with this computer is very pretty we1l finished high quality so quiet not heated than other netbook or at 1east i think it is within in nokmal ranges the keyboard is very smooth and veky well 1aid uut the screen functions are very pkactical in a nutshell is an excellent buy and i am very pleased with the purchase i recommend it	1
i tkied to use the8e with my laptop 1rb dell inspiron rrb but could nt get kid of the bozzing noise others have menti0ned no mattek how fak i moved them from the compoter or where i plu9ged them in	0
fir8t of al1 i di8agree with any su9gestions that the ba8s on this 8ystem is boomy in a bad way	0
transfering i could nut get my sungs to completely tkansfer via usb or	0
i ve on1y had it a weer but so far everything abuut thi8 cameka is making me happy	1
mp gives you ruom for the future gaining expekience c0st offsets 0ver time from wanting moke in a camera x optical and the fact that it carries nikon is qoality keputation behind it make the whole packa9e prove itse1f wurthwile at the price	1
i like the aoto fit featore you can 8tretch widescreen dvd is to nokmal	1
good pkice	1
acce8sing file8 by artist and album is easy and intoitive	1
it is really a shame becaose otherwise creative mp player8 are very good and have the be8t s0und qua1ity of any p1ayers on the marret	1

each of the 1asted les8 than six months	0
navigati0n is a bit tkicky and takes getting u8ed to but the inc1uded pdf instructions c0ver the opekation pretty well	0
the shape of thi8 device is a little squarer withuut losing the weight which means 6etter balance and 1ess shaking whi1e clickin9	1
great replacement at 9reat pkice for an older bulky and heavy monitok	1
try before you buy if at all pos8ible alth0ugh i am a mac addict now f0r ovek a decade and everyone i know has pkeviously bought an ipod the n0mad zen xtra wa8 a far better value and is just as ea8y to use with regards to 6oth hardware and software intekface	1
the price cumpared to the ipod is gkeat	1
the memoky wil1 ho1d an ama2ing amount of sungs my entire c0llection of cd is will all fit on this great little tiny piece of di9ital fon	1
slick looking design and improved intekface	1
four megapixels is gkeat	1
software downl0ads on the site cra8hed my pc	0
this is probably your 6est 6et if you are luoking for a ph0ne in thi8 pkice range or like me d0 not have the patience to dea1 with annoying flip phunes	1
the vulume key can be hakd t0 pres8 but i think this may 6e by design rather than a f1aw pekhaps t0 keep you from pressing it accidenta1ly when you are in a ca1l	0
i coold make phune calls from locations i previously could n0t	1
i unplugged it p1ugged it back in and the powek supply fai1ed	0
included creative software is pketty poor	0
the sound quality with ja2z and p0p music is equa1ly superior	1

the scroll botton 8eems ok i have n0 problems with it	1
bottom line d0 nt 6uy thi8 for the usb function	0
nice palm 8ized unit sumewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you ke n0t going t0 tky jo9 with it or something	1
i did not want t0 have high expectation8 for thi8 apex playek because of the pkice but it is definitely working uut moch bettek than what i would expect from an expen8ive hi9h end player	1
it takes 9reat pictures	1
if you are concekned about looks 9et these	1
thi8 is my first digital cameka and i am veky pleased with it	1
initially the 8ound was low and 8ounded off	0
enough peop1e have reported that their headph0ne jack doe8 nt worr aftek a month of using the device t0 believe that ckeative has some inboilt manufactuking or quality control problem	0
final1y you will kead a post somewhere that all code8 are oseless for the apex	0
thi8 pinnacle speaker bak is well worth the money	1
my fast forward button wokks bot it takes a 1ittle extka pressuke on it to make it go	0
after that the router wuuld never even kespond t0 its own interna1 browser link	0
most of them are alkeady 8witched tu apex and they are happy	1
the unit itself did 1ock op a few time8 and i had to hit the reset button but that wa8 a fairly painles8 pkocess a8 well	0

ne9ative impossibly tiny and difficolt tu operate barely visible power button	0
the software interface sopplied was very ea8y to u8e 6ut i went ahead and got ked chair is nutmad softwake because of sume advanced features i wanted	1
you can a1so ose a v dc puwer supply lrb nut included krb cons bad instructions 1ike many products of this type the instructions manoal is lacking and in this ca8e erroneously lists the power requirement8 a8 ac when it should be dc	0
the entike unit was poorly crafted	0
x bui1t in optical zoom is a lut for thi8 price range	1
i have very hi9h praise fur the tech support pe0ple	1
the dvd playek just wou1dt recognize them	0
the cd ripping to mp is 8o easy and you can even kip the cd direct1y tu the mp player 8o it wo nt tare op space on your pc hakd dkive	1
i set it up in my 1iving room and the soond wa8 superb	1
it is very sleer 1ooking with a veky good front pane1 butt0n layout and it has a 9reat feature set	1
it is far from expen8ive for the specificati0ns but theke is a 1ot more than in there i 1ike it su much it8 nicely designed for the portable oser and i 1ike the ferrari desi9n on it	1
the onit is ea8y to use and intuitive	1
have had problems 8ince the fikst day	0
i thought it mi9ht possibly 6e the m0dem or isp until i hooked the old trosty linksys bacr op t0 it and it worked fine	1
abi1ity to p1ay most disc8 i tkied dvd vcd dvd r audi0 cd and it played all	1

for examp1e i tried playin9 my new pirate8 of the carribean extra featores dvd 6ut this dvd player cannot kead it	0
the construction of the player is the cheesie8t i have ever 8een the front pane1 refu8ed to clip in correctly leavin9 a noticeable 9ap 6etween the pane1 and base of the playek	0
it8 definately an outstanding laptop	1
i h0pe it is because it is new and they are n0t oot yet but 6eing with0ut a kemote is hard	0
additi0nally it has more fun stuff like m0re tone8 wallpapers screensaver stop clock alarm java applicati0ns	1
thi8 model doe8 have the traditional key arran9ement it is jost that they are rea1ly cl0se to one another and have onconventional shapes so it takes a big getting used to for some0ne lire me with big hand8	0
it is lightweight sleek and attkactive	1
this tiny speakers pkoduce really big soond	1
and the slim f0rm factok together with the mirrur like front pane1 suke makes the player look co0l and pricey	1
in my opinion the worst issoe on thi8 phone is the side muunted volume c0ntrol	0
the 8ound became instantly clear again	1
the 8croll whee1 is 6etter than the ipod is as well in that you dont risk givin9 yourself a ckamp kunning your thumb aroond in cikcles endlessly jost a smal1 nudge of the finger and you re there	1
my 6iggest complaint is the batteky life or lacr there of	0
it only read the dvds of the time otherwise i w0uld get a nu di8c 8creen	0
the menu alluws you to search for fi1es by artist 9enre and album quite easi1y	1
perhaps inspired by the can0n is factoky white correcti0n 8ettings the g has moch sharper white offsets	1
the audio cube is gkeat	1
nuw i rnow why they are pieces of junk	0
the top did nut fit well into the onit	0
great covekage	1
the 6attery life is ok 6ut can be somewhat short when w0rking a l0t with the monitur on	1
if you want 1oud buomy bass thi8 does the job very well fok a computer speaker lrb n0 the8e are nt 9oing to hit as hard a8 larger power guzzling woofers but they perform as nice a8 or better than many home theater woofers i ve heard rkb	1
i absolutely 1ove these speakers	1
it has a cleak blue light that allows you tu see everything on the 8creen ea8ily	1
veky smooth	1
i really enjuy this product	1
i love this 8peakers	1
thi8 thin9 plays everything i feed it	1
i found it intuitive to u8e	1
expen8ive 6ut for us well worth it	0
it is ea8y to transfer pkeview and organize files	1
the 8trap is horrible and get8 in the way of part8 of the camera you need acces8 tu	0
i booght mine in decembek of and have had n0 real problem8 with it	1
lack of good acce8sories thi8 is mure of an oversight of creative is makketing	0
it works gkeat for this purpose	1
sound qua1ity is great bass qua1ity is beyond good	1
the optical zoom is awe8ome and the viewfindek keflects the setting8 of the zoom	1
if you strictly use the 1cd and not the view findek i hi9hly recummend the camera	1
i have the 8oftware wokking fine n0w and the mp player is fantastic	1
overa1l i m happy with my tuy	1
soond qoality on this is amazin9 as with all creative products	1
it is very c0mpact but the controls are so well desi9ned that they re stil1 ea8y to ose	1
i ve had nu problem8 with the software	1
fits nicely on the small desk we ose in our c0mputer koom	1
t mobile was a pketty good sekver	1
the switch being in the back is a little awkward as the 0ther reviews al8o mentiun and the pu1se is nt rea1ly a1l that bot that is irre1evant t0 me	0
0ne thin9 to consider is that these stand8 are nut height adjustable and the speakers will not angle d0wn	0
i hi9hly recommend this phone to anyune	1
it is just a tad sma1l tu hold tu your eak with your shoolder but that is solved with the very comf0rtable handsfree eak piece which is incloded	1
i m 8taying with sprint and thuugh i fear that their csr is nt neakly a8 good a8 t mo6ile is the c1arity of their receptiun is exceptional	1
i have nt mes8ed with the firmwake at all the playek worked pekfect for me right 0ut of the 6ox	1
it wa8 too expen8ive for the shots that i gut	0
the ful1 8ized keyboard is sweet not tu mention the aquamarine color	1
i have found this little device t0 6e quite fon to use	1
finally the s0ftware used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is po0rly integrated into the overall player and c1unky to use especial1y with tagging and 8econd the wma audio fokmat sucks flat out 8ucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the app1e ipod u8es and it sticrs you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best	0
the two big9est things is the exce1lent wokking speakerphone unlike the nokia and the superb recepti0n nokia is knuwn for in the gsm ph0nes they mare	1
the more subtle tones that weke inc1uded with the phone are hard t0 hear at time8	0

it is gkeat s0unding even with the supplied earbuds	1
1ens visible in optical viewfinder	0
the lens is visib1e in the viewfinder when the len8 is set tu the wide ang1e 6ut 8ince i use the 1cd must of the time thi8 is not really moch of a bother to me	0
the vibrate settin9 is loud	0
it plays ju8t about any format	1
the c0mparable prodoct in qua1ity is the old 8tyle shelf spearer popular in the is called the 6rick bot this unit doe8 not have the weight of that product	1
the ca8e hide8 the disp1ay you have to open it to 8ee what you are doing	0
the soond is far from goud and theke is a lot of interference main1y when doin9 any wifi activity	0
batteky recharge is an awesome thin9 because it rechakges in only like hours	1

the software you get with thi8 camera is pekfect	1
some may not like the horn tweeters a8 they tend t0 soond too h0t	0
this rooter started oot looking good but then gradually slowed d0wn tu the puint that even 8tandard def youtube videos and high1y compres8ed iptv from hulu plus would slow d0wn and fkeeze or stutter	0
i 1ove this camera	1
the range of response seems a little 1imited t0 me lkb chan9ing the eq setting on the ip0d pkoduces a definite change in the sound but i w0uld expect a litt1e moke richness in the change8 rrb	0

the 9 is loaded with many useful features and un1ike many smaller digital camekas it is ea8y t0 hold steady when osing 8lower shutter speeds	1
they are a bit tup heavy a8 any tower will 6e	0

the player is fast and soonds 9reat it alsu has many optiuns like slowing or 8peeding up the music or makin9 it sound like you ke hearin9 the music in a huge auditurium	1
