the player feels very delicate as if i m holding an actual hard drive	0
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla	1
i thot my original monitor had a good image but the s hl has a much brighter display	1
can t say whether i rec d an updated model but it will not read dvd rw is or vcd is for me	0
it plays everything even vcd is	1
audio on video also lacking	0
the satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones	1
with the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch	1
but overall this is a good camera with a really good picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability	1
will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles	0
then i would say that this lcd monitor have many feature in one piece	1
ca nt beat it for the price	1
first and foremost it will take better pic is than most film camera is	1
this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier	1
the player user interface is intuitive to use and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection	1
noiseless lightweight and oh yeah	1
shareport is not compatible with mac os	0
the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the mm wide angle wc e the optical viewfinder is partially obscured	0
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product	1
very comfortable camera easy to use and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price	1
if you want background music better than your tv sound for movies speakers around the house for parties outside get togethers this is about as good as you can expect for the price	1
the catch is that while it plays movies just fine it has refused to read second discs with the movie extras on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that	0
the powershot g is a great camera	1
do nt buy this player	0
only one disk played through to completion successfully	0
this really is a laptop in a small form	1
first the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds	0
service is great as far as i can tell features work like a charm ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t mobile and aim is great	1
it is very simple to import via iphoto and then move them to photoshop	1
retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display	1
one of the dvd is i received as a christmas present kept freezing	0
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good but my feeling at this time is two thumbs up	1
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on off button	0
amazing speed and easy to set up	1
this netbook is closer to the notebook powers but still very cheap	1
the vibration is not top	0
and also it is priced very affordably	1
one still works fine the other quit after one day	0
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr the internal flash on the g produces harsh flat images with ugly hot spots	0
will never purchase apex again	0
i assumed they had exceptional service but their reception in my area is horrendous	0
mb for a camera like this is a joke	0
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close a very annoying thing after ahwile	0
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that months ago is no longer working	0
also the instruction manual is very bad	0
downloads are a snap and quick	1
the only negative thing about this was the instructions for adjusting the display were not very clear and it took a little time to figure out how to do it	0
the setup and transfer process was cake for me	1
i am in the business and have seen many lcd monitors that sell for much much more and aside from monitors with a higher resolution lrb ie x rrb there is no noticable difference at all	1
my case doesnt close maybe mine was just faulty but the case isnt that great	0
this speaker mount is suitable for small speaker	1
the nikon coolpix line is a well established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model	1
both are absolutely great items	1
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping	1
purchased this item because of reviews and price	1
all in all trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift	0
no other color phone has the combination of features that the offers	1
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews yes the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder	0
dialogue is very noticeably clearer	1
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap replace them	0
well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it it will be a breeze	0
build quality is great	1
affordable price reliable item and excellent customer service	1
compared to the dell monitor this replaced it is far brighter and weighs much less	1
not playing some dvds and then finally after less than days it just would not recognize anything i pop in it	0
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could nt be easier to use	1
there is a clock and date which can get helpful	1
they said the product was defective and said they would send a new one	0
there are a few things that i do nt like about the design	0
i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow car boat and wind	1
even the battery life is great it advertises hours it is actually a little less but still good	1
if you want good sound stay away	0
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved	1
third gripe these monitors can suffer from the lcd equivalent of screen burn image persistence if you like	0
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse	1
this router works fine and i am able to stream video in all rooms of the house at the same time	1
someday your going to need support and acer is technical support department is the next to worthless	0
my linksys froze for minutes or longer when applying changes	0
it plays alternate video formats very well	1
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective	0
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use if you read the manual	1
this is a preference but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels i d be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less redolent of a teenager is car system	1
big storage my entire cd collection in one small device	1
the cons are nt really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it is based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did nt have any that might be the same as another	0
the software is somewhat nice to look at using it is not the easiest	0
the set up was pretty simple basically a matter of hooking everything up and rebooting your system at which time you re taken to the d link website to finalize how your setup will be	1
i know the saying is you get what you pay for but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this there is no excuse	0
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy day warranty ended	0
sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great	1
many people have written about the software being its one downfall personally i have nt had a single problem with the software i m running windows me	1
this is quite simply the best you can ask for	1
phone lying by your pillowside	1
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software	1
it is loud and the quality is good	1
the center channel is jbl s center ii this unit is very powerful and produces crystal clear dialogues and it is a way speaker system	1
i m not a person well read in technology but this is just an absolutely wonderful computer	1
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority aperture priority or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality	1
i still have over gb left and already have over cd is on it	1
the voice quality is very good and it gets great reception	1
uploading music is quick and easy	1
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter	0
ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up	0
i like the speakphone function a lot	1
who knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out but it probably will	0
as an engineer i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale	0
sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse but its really good	1
i m convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed and will not hold up to normal use	0
short warranty occasional freeze up somewhat flimsy navigation wheel	0
pros great sound sleek cool look compact comes with rca adapter speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted cons mainly for pc only lrb but works fairly well with tv is rrb wattage is nt all that high no immediate line in lrb so you ca nt hook your mp player up and get srs right out of the box rrb i ve heard a bunch of people say that the cord is for the rear speakers are nt long enough	1
the software runs smooth it is nice to look at it is very organized easy to follow and makes things very simple	1
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture zoom etc	1
for those of you looking for excellent sound reproduction expecially during a raging decepticon battle look no further	1
works great	1
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon and is better than anything else i ve seen	1
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger now blue backlit screen which is infinitely better	1
the images are vivid and crisp the text and fonts are very clear	1
i really liked the size so i researched what to buy and this was it	1
overall it is an impressive display	1
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly	1
extremely convenient	1
i have nt really need any since the display have proven to be very intelligent when resizing different screen res is and i can use the ati drivers to adjust things like color temp and gamma	1
besides the one problem this machine is amazing	1
the auto mode is good enough for most shots but the also boasts versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have nt played with it too much on manual	1
do not buy this product	0
this monitor is much much better but still not great	1
in a word awesome is how i would describe this camera	1
mine was weeks old and i chucked it in the trash where it belongs	0
the camera is a work of art science that is understood	1
i have not been disappointed with my purchase	1
this device solves the problem nicely	1
this is a good product	1
my favorite features although there are many are the speaker phone the radio and the infrared	1
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop	0
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources you can t do this on the ipod	1
however the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega static to the point where i d have to dial numbers times to get a clear line	0
i would not recommend this or any acer product to anyone except perhaps my ex	0
though it does nt have quite the screen real estate it is an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of x	1
it is a very intuitive program	1
the free carrying case is really protective and to me its the only accessory you need	1
sharp crisp images	1
the signal to noise ratio is nice and high at decibles and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods	1
i highly recomend theese speakers	1
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it is class	1
i conclude that the ethernet transceiver d link uses is not as good as that of other brands	0
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo nt stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it	0
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i m not too keen on www ipodsdirtysecret com	1
remote buttons are small and closely spaced especially with the menu buttons	0
with nikon although picture qualities are as good as any other mp cameras i ve had the following headaches	1
this is a plus with this netbook the increased size of inches means better and clear view of webpages and woks made in office	1
so far the software for the pc works easily	1
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch	1
i compared this to a lot of other cameras believe me it is value for money	1
this camera is ideal for people who want more power but do nt want to spend s dollars on a camera	1
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said	0
and finally in early june this router stopped broadcasting an internet signal	0
the sound is great not as good as my each klipsch r s but come on for the size and price you will not beat these units	1
nothing has broken on it and it plays all the dvds i have	1
this x monitor fits my space very well	1
the nomad is not ugly it is not that big it comfortably fits in my pocket or heavy and the controls are not hard to get used to	1
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by rd party programs like notmad	1
the mobile text messaging chat picture sharing etc other nicities that you would enjoy	1
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy	0
however the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality	0
the music is easy to get to and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen	1
the zen does nt support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders documents and programs can t be launched from the zen so it is not a hard disk it is a storage device at best	0
the cool thing about the ad it plays alot of different file like mp wma cds jpeg and kodak picture cds dvd is dvd r is	1
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas	0
it works well enough for me to be satisfied with it and it is possible that i m missing something	1
solid high quality construction	1
the nomad explorer works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player	1
just point and shoot and the photos were great	1
set up was smooth and both wired and wireless devices worked very well on it	1
the only reason i did nt give it stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak but that is really to be expected is nt it	0
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face that sometimes comes off a bit easily but besides that it is perfect	0
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right	1
the player works well with my sony srs a powered speakers	1
sure this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod	1
definetely a great camera	1
i forgot the case does nt fit	0
the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features	1
crappy headphones	0
the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it	1
also their t zones although cheap never works	0
i guess i do nt have to mention that i do not recommend this product that i most likely will return it and keep my fingers off cisco linksys stuff in future	0
with the automatic settings i really have nt taken a bad picture yet	1
and so far i ve been very pleased	1
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do nt figure out a way to break it	0
basic usage is easy but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used	1
after less than hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment for myself and for my parents for whom it was a gift	0
i verified the signal strengths with a laptop and there was no problem there	1
obviously one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage	1
i would have liked to have given it stars docking that star only for the size	0
the software could nt be better and the mp player works like a dream i could nt give this anything but a i wish there was a	1
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens	0
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working	0
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned	1
power volume and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy	1
great camera i have been using this for several months and got excellent results simple friendly usage in many scenes indoor outdoor snow close up macro etc	1
really happy with this little camera	1
the dir was so easy to setup it was almost too easy	1
we count on good products at a good price	1
apple is wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini	1
assembly of the stands is very straightforward and well detailed in the instructions	1
so far we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine	1
the colors and viewing angle are about average but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor	1
overall they are great stands and look good	1
this means that the vga connection will not work with my computers	0
purchased the ad about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it	0
i love the continuous shot mode which allows you to take up to pix in rapid succession great for action shots	1
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on	0
just a little overview powershot g is the flagship of canon is powershot series and its an slr like camera its megapixel and full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance	1
it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow	0
i love the eos based controls and easy menus	1
it could be a little bit bigger but it is easy to get used to	0
the size is small	1
i do here a constant high pitched distorted sound not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough	0
it is flimsy plastic and the monitor bounces around while you type	0
there were a few attractive features such as the small size and the layout of the remote	1
they sound wonderful the only issue is where to put them when i move around	1
i m very happy with this router and would recommend it	1
the only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side but still is very good and you can set your equalizer to make up for it	0
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful	1
it has all the features an amatuer photo enthusiast would want	1
the set up for this product was a breeze	1
only issue is with updating firmware	0
update january th the second one crapped out only after a week dont buy this product	0
so much packed in a small case and very affordable	1
the colors are bright beautiful and clear	1
at double speed it still plays mp s with sound they are pitch corrected and smooth but twice as fast	1
still at least from my perspective a great camera for the money and i m a happy camper	1
the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility	1
weeks later the monitor start having other issues only half screen turns on or it become a full green screen and doesnt change you need to turn it off and on again until it works	0
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep	1
usb very fast	1
very fast delivery	1
the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player	1
the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic but usb recharging would be a convenient choice	0
i liked this one enough to buy another	1
battery life is about of that advertised no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players occasional software lockups replacement battery is expensive	0
if you use software correctly put in all the id tags you will get an awesome database collection from which you can easily access your songs	1
it does not distort video and pictures look great	1
although i was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look but it really works	0
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation a slightly audible click if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do nt even notice the click	1
good quality video	1
i felt the system was slow so i purchased a gb ram from crucell and replaced the standard gb that came with the system	0
the radio feature has superb sound quality	1
if you bring up an album but absolutely hate some of the tracks the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order	1
all reviews i ve seen seem to indicate that the creative mp jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these nd generation jukeboxed	1
also the nomad is hours of battery life versus is handy	1
one bad thing though i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably die before the player does	0
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with canned air	0
i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players	0
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking by artist song title genre etc	1
when we tried to hook up the first one it was broken the motor would not eject discs or close the door	0
great sound and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers	1
file transfers are fast nearly a song per second via usb	1
i took them to a different room and tested them with my mp player where they worked fine and sounded pretty good	1
although canon is batteries are proprietary they last a really long time recharge fairly quickly in the camera plus if you want more power you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon	1
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away	0
love this speaker	1
the songs do nt play one after another like on a cd	0
you guys need to hire new repair technicians because the ones that are in the repair center obviously have no idea what they are doing	0
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk	0
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway	0
i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down	1
the display is awesome you can see everything you want and read it clearly	1
the scroll button is nt the best as it sometimes can be hard to select	0
thats pretty much it the speakers rock the control station and remote are nifty and the sub is powerful	1
input and headphone on right jack is super handy	1
m u files are used by most mp players like musicmatch and winamp but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists it does nt care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray	1
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable	1
and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world	1
i m glad i went with it it actually exceeds my viewsonic for color brightness and pixel quality	1
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc	0
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line	0
scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling	0
i seem to be getting to hours on the battery which is sufficient for my needs	1
however the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off	1
these were only my first week impressions but until now i strongly recommend this product and i m very satisfied with it	1
i am very happy with the acer inch flat screen monitor which i received for christmas	1
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all	1
when i bought the third one i thought i can give d link one more try but now i regret my decision	0
we like acer products and this one does nt disappoint	1
the battery is replaceable and there is a leather case	1
the remote control and reciever not so good	0
i send my camera to nikon for servicing took them a whole weeks to diagnose the problem	0
the highs and lows sound great and personally i think the bass is at a perfect level lrb at rrb definitely not boomy	1
the battery lasts very long when playing music but writing files to the player drains the battery fast so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files	1
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake	1
the ihome however has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level	1
this is a superb system and highly recommended	1
very sleek stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has	1
whether you are a novice or an expert its ease of use and functionality goes together	1
battery life is good for a phone of this size	1
these are good looking durable speaker stands	1
you can fill a small room with sound pretty good but do nt think it rivals a home theater system	1
the range seems quite good even through walls	1
the screen is a very pleasing matte and the colors are great	1
i must have differing preferences than others here as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony is that i thought sounded good on other players	1
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player	1
however because this dock plays about any mp player and is of good quality and low price it should sell very well	1
playlists can be generated on the fly or by using the software and there are a bevy of eq options	1
excellent monitor	1
installation was easy as advertised	1
this thing seriously is a good player though	1
logitech is n speaker lapdesk wins in the area of comfort	1
the included memory card is too small	0
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera	1
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great	1
the included leather pouch is a big plus it actually protects the unit well something a lot of carrying cases fail to do with other audio devices	1
third creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer	1
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over of all photos taken by a beginner	1
however i now have it running nicely and it produces a nice picture	1
far surpasses anything i ve heard to date for their superior sound	1
yes the buttons are a bit small and close but they are functional	1
fits perfectly in the corner of my small desk	1
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player but not the folder name	0
from the speakerphone that can be used up to feet away with clarity to the downloadable poly graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone	1
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical	0
some dvd is i rented would not play	0
the battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good lrb not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer rrb	1
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks	0
the colors are clear also	1
the small size is perfect for my little hands but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person	1
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are nt as easy as the ipod is or as sexy looking	0
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp player	1
the clarity and contrast are exactly what i was looking for in a monitor and spec for spec it is a bargain compared to other brands	1
interface practically seamless	1
the speaker bar response was spot on	1
construction all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last	0
for the price the sound is great and their portability lrb pack down to a large egg shape rrb is quite good	1
i do nt think the external switch is much of a feature because in the end you have to learn how to identify ip addresses switch the router from from a dynamic to static ip address and assign a static ip address that is compatible with your router or modem	0
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception	1
the dynamic playlists feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate	0
i hesitated for so long because of the price	0
i ve had it for a week now do nt regret the purchase one bit and i never leave home without it	1
on several different occasions it has displayed no disc with a disc inside	0
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones	1
i exchanged this from an lg that i bought for nearly twice as much and the colors on the lg were not at all as nice as this	1
the rechargeable battery is a great feature	1
i am very pleased with the apex ad it plays just about anything you put in the drawer	1
an excellent product with excellent and typically superb logitech production values	1
the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations	0
feels solid in hand	1
reliable highly available and ease of administration and forget about me lrb do nt bother anymore rrb equipment	1
this router works very well right out of the box	1
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy	1
i especially like the more commonly used buttons such as play pause and stop to be larger and conveniently placed	0
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot	0
in my opinion it is the best camera for the money if you re looking for something that is easy to use small good for travel and provides excellent sharp images	1
it is size also makes it ideal for travel	1
well i can not complain about the volume bass or mounting abilities of the system	1
only used for month before it is down	0
the zen does not have a stop button	0
the phone also sports an image gallery a calendar organizer alarm clock with snooze fm radio games java applications and gprs high speed internet connection	1
no problems with any of those connections	1
my only grips are the incompatibility with xp and the usb hub in the display	0
the buttons are confusing and super small	0
these a great speakers full of sound	1
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust	0
i deducted a star because when i put my ipod and ipad on full volume the speaker is bass began to completely ruin the sound	0
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories as always	1
the face plate which pops out for the battery pops open by itself every minutes or so	0
i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like	1
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder but does not detract from the image at all	0
it hasnt gone below the second notch so the battery life seems fine	1
it has several play options one of the best is an option to shuffle based on all or a certain playlist	1
since i received the phone i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t zones would work in hours	0
the network was down the internet connection was gone and the router was completely unresponsive	0
it is some protection for the unit but for useability forget it	0
the phones are awesome	1
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player	1
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable	1
while light it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets	0
have nt setup any advanced features but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what i had with old router	1
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash	0
i love this little speaker	1
it is light weight enough to take with you everywhere but powerful enough to get outstanding pix	1
tiny	1
i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more	1
battery life is over hours compared to about hours for the g or the hours for most nikons	1
one neat thing i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms no problem for the camera rooms looked like they had ample lighting	1
there is one very annoying problem with this model though the keyboard is sticky meaning despite this tablet is brand new and just arrived when i press and release a key on the keyboard it acts as if i kept it pressed continuing to type the same character again and again	0
