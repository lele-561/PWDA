a lot nt play wo of discs	0
update the finish is more mirror like gold than silver and i like it	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
on average indoor shots with flash a are not quite as good as mm	0
to my a kbps wma file sounds just as good and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player one of is probably the best out there	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
m i delighted with this product	1
the second set is working just fine	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
i highly highly recommend it	1
the screen when i plugged it into my mac mini however looked wonderful	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the grain was terrible	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
no propietary headset headphone jackno jack	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
about it i ve timely responses emailed creative tech support but and gotten already they will fix it for me if necessary	1
i love that it is a tablet it is much so more convenient than a regular laptop	1
it has never worked	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
this is an excellent player especially for ipod price are features that with comparable to and even excel the the	1
i am so happy with the camera	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
i love the quality	1
get it it is woth a penny	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to people know that if your ipod is in an case can not the ipod without first	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that very important the sound quality is better than the ipod the battery is replacable is excellent and nano finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my busy thank you giving technical support stars	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
their tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to i customer service dept	0
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
but well within days the video output quit working	0
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
not only is more affordable but for windows which is what i have	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
i ve tried playing all of had the pleasure of these discs and they all play great	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the air	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid controls can	1
the apex has been a steady performer for a turning point me	1
also the feature to automatically update the lyrics in the song information is nt always accurate	0
but with a higher price comes lower quality	0
get it it is woth one else every penny	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
very good range and seemed be to better in the horizontal position	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
i love the storage in this thing	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
in all i say this a decent for the money	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually no disc	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the pictures are razor sharp and beautiful even in macro	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to watch a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the dvd player to do it is job	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box tech service the failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
i think the real reason that made the changes that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing also are algorithms better	1
ear canal the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it out to be	0
the service from the supplier was discontinued	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
mediasource did not install on machine my personal notebook	0
the memory is staggering	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
other then piece of kit that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
fm receiver it none	0
setup is and it worked right out of the box	1
the battery better alot is than most of the phones out there	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would try again have to restart the router then get going again	0
without having to go would be far better through the isp and taking all the extra steps through the netgear genie tool	0
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
it is the best camera on the market	1
however i never my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
sound in class best	1
billy joel was nt when kidding he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
small would definatley recommend to a friend and i would its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
it was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1

it sure is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
sharp image	1
the price very good is	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
the eax sound enhancement feature do nt did enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1

it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1

i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
anyway this player is a great deal and really i love it	1
awesome sound system	1
the controls are on the buttons the side instead of on the front the top which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
no propietary headset	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very in order viewing angle limited vertical to get consistent contrast	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone it is a bit heavy but out there	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
storage capacity	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the switch negotiated the speed was set to just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
i just got my new phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
another nice both in that the unit has thing optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned is the literature i d scanned before buying	1

i love the quality of the pictures	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
at an incredible price	1
when i finally made it home i discovered that the menu options for sending a message via either text or email simply were nt there	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline battery for those emergency pics you have to have	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it nicely without falling out	1
player this apex dvd well turned out great	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is the one megapixel	1
i called apex is support number and tried to hang up but it just kept ringing	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
it also has a great feel and weight to it	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
it worked great and we just love it pluged it in	1
i am happy over gigs of music stored on this baby well a gigs of media files in the data folder	1
t is which does not work at all on several long stretches on that same route	1
the pictures are absolutely the camera captures the minutest of	1
the battery life is very good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless to mbps down	0
i m extremely glad i bought it	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
my wife is even more than me pleased due to its widescreen	1
last night i turn off needed to reset the router	0
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
this is a list of people who is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i a returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
so the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code buggy was in alpha stage at best	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs to only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you will configure the phone to network used on a different be	0
is cool fm radio the	1
than less minimal pause between songs that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
also your visitors a nice guest feature so has can connect separate of your primary link	1
difficult i navigation wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
it has a beautiful design customizable of features very easy to use very configurable and lots and the battery duration is amazing	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with this netbook is single processor	1
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
nice and compact	1
the screen complaint one is too easily scratched	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
at would very least a sturdier more protective carrying case the be nice	0
with tried to play the song three times i no success	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies and i put them on dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
works super easy	1
treat the battery well has lasted	1
item do nt buy this monitor	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
but a little weighty otherwise fine	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
the color screen is as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
for the money apex machines have lost	1
for a while even i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates great price	1
great color display and picture sharp just the right size for my desk	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1

this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
key instead	0
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no rrb down or tilt feature up	0
they will not respond to my emails answer the phone and the phone line is constantly busy	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
i m not very happy about it	0
since it would not i called support	0
i spent a lot of time on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
dead no pixels on mine	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd version	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred become frustrated quite quickly will you	0
my only complaint is that the cord is too short	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
i just had to suck it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
i agree with the earlier agree reviewer angle and you need to adjust the brightness who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
reason i rated it a four is because that diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the menu options appear one at whole taking in the menu the a time screen and one has to scroll down one by one using have memorized where they are up order to select them by or the number keypad	0
these speakers are great	1
i expected the x zoom digital to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
the game program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just a few times	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or a in basement four bars all the time	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you look at the picture but the lens knows this and makes it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t be done with some of your real dvds	0
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens and cap the lens itself	0
instead	0
other things that i miss are a headphone jack and a standard mm headset jack	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the hands free powerful is quite speakerphone	1
to the simple ipod ones are much inferior the controls	0
i m it would and can be useful in a different setting where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
not play relies on i d no fm or recording	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
it was already there and we just plugged it in	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily the type of person met and surpassed my needs	1
just the right size and great color display sharp picture for my desk	1
they sound nt in my opinion and i have wonderful even touched any equalizers	1
easy to hook up	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of course	1
i just got my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
any protection is no speaker grill to offer there to the driver	0
there are so many functions in a lot of this little yet powerful camera	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
after years with that carrier expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled software explorer nomad	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
this player is going to work fine with everything else	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
hours battery life excellent beats ipod is	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
they fired away and it all turned out quite nicely	1
uploading server from my the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
made really what this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
much faster than single processor with my previous acer one netbook	1
the scroll bar a bit is of a pain	0
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once there online the router is login at is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
to is closest this camera perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
im sorry one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
the ability to connect a usb thumb drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1

huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much but it is a lot and i have gb out of the provided to you	1
the zen stores to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk nor does it allow documents to be read or opened programs to ru data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow all of its data files on a single disk the zen store documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
with gb of storage i have about gb of space on the player with room for about more	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0

the replacement unit had a problem i bought too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts change the weather forecast i have found this problem in my area	0

ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
it did also not seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
overall the g point of view as well as a sharpness contrast white balance color balance and color response point o delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
also the player sometimes freezes in the middle of the game but can also be annoying	0
i was looking forward to it if all the other already said it was slow	0
a great system at an incredible price	1

otherwise a car very decent monitor for its price	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0

while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is one of the best brands in cellphones	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and equalizers have nt even touched any i	1
the midrange is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt find it connect to the internet	0
well it had good power but no precision at i thought all	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does to seem not read certain dvds	0
i try the player using navigating is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
that keeps me only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and the mbyte cf with a mbyt that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who is looking for a portable mp player over a cd player also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and is willing to pay next to nothing	1
typically problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
but this camera is better great	1
it was worth the wait because this is standout monitor has all this and more	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in the next few months it will cost me about half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1

this camera also has a great weight and feel to it	1
when i first turned turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1

great camera great investment	1
it has a usb port you so can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1

the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and trying to find a way suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
to use	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
this is insanely fast	1

this site has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb and nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is because these are computer speakers	0

the sound quality is very exceptable	1
i have excellent hearing but the speaker the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
i have nt had time to really push this player the to limit expected from creative labs audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be but	1

very use to simple	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
only thing missing creativity from creative is a cd burner	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
the software has never been a hassle for me at all	1

featured image	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once talked to you actually got someone	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
i think the real reason makes more sense to use that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of halfway router is interface	0
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
this is the first time my router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
i have had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly than consistently and those of other models i ve had	1
i m not the type of person who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
only get one camera in it we could if	0
the quick is nt any good becuase it either needs to configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
very happy with the the price and monitor	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially in the market at the the sound quality low price these sell for here on amazon	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
like other reviewers said it was hell	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
oops easy back to go online and adjust it there	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and use it to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping files into it	0
i have over songs in my playlist at the moment and the mix of genres does a nice job mixing it up	1
also can display is hinged and it the be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
it seems that with every firmware router the release gets better better	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over has none of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphon but as i it get a lot of positive reviews and it has none of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc overhas none of those problems people havent had problems with the player for a whil ve only had the but as i m only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problem player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me a lot of positive reviews and it has none of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i m only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if th too	1
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
the speakers have a bass but there is very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
exceptable is very the sound quality	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
very tight joints excellent black finish fit and and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
the can mediasource software not work on my pc	0
finally and can be complicated because the tracks are by individually making playlists from the computer are organized listed cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also a harddrive wants who anyone based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
for of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
volume level is is ok volume ok	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick not sure review	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
i was looking for portability and and good battery life this product delivers both	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at to recharge the included ac adapter	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is great of just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a no printed instructions deal with it information missing	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a card mb compactflash pitiful and for most purposes it is not enough	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the price is excellent the battery life is excellentthe fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellen the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellen the best ipod i have ever used thesound is excellen excellent	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of the building	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am bored	0
its a bit bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
it is more than days and it does not the picture no what do	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of my computer but was awful trying to use it on my phone which is somewhat of a problem	0

main dial is not available	0
its focusing system is also the system very flexible	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
main dial is not backlit	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is ruining my media	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
bookmarks for example are available on this page an excellent feature but not on this player	0
a great product unbeatable price	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
has a type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
quite simply the firmware frankly i think and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
when it works different its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
the quality of the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
mediasource is an application with serious problems user interface flaws	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced and expensive	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
the works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the g has a different type of charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without having to worry about running down the battery	1
in addition it can be controlled with a remote control	1
a great camera is this for you	1
the sound quality of these are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
this phone is good with a huge screen and a lot of features built into it	1
bass fanatics look will be at the s pii	1
i immediately had problems getting the player have been playing this game and to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
the person on the other end of call the can hear you perfectly	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
by setting the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent quality photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
guys these speakers are great	1
this model router has now failed me the in twice short span of time mentioned	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
a lot of reviews to use easy has mentioned about this	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
the looking apex dvd player i ve seen	1
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
the customer support is very rude	0
tech support from apex is literally free	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my	1
but for do i what use it is perfect	1
is absolutely terrible software	0
as a matter of fact the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
however i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
lcd screen was very large and readable	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
yes the picture quality and features which are other camera too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
within a year there are dial with my menu problems knob	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal went out	0
the person too on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact a picture on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the set up it is fool proof and offers a superior resul is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
the is not good either and the driver trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally light	1
it did also seem to have a strong smell electronics new for some time	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
this phone is	1
the light auto correction system	1
but the sound quality is very good is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
with mediasource being so easy no use found i for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
loading cds ipod but i think it would have been with the was somewhat time consuming as well	0
the phone is compact small light and very attractive	1
the food is very good	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run that i can t use at worst a very expensive one on which i can s create folders or at worst an expensive lesson i be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from worst again	0
video output stopped workin	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
am i enjoying my phone a lot	1
having usb makes a better life for very fast transfers	1
item the out quickly was in benefits came with easy to use we on her laptop disk set have nt had to re set shipped router no longer so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection up added security good condition neighbors at all hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
volume level is	1
one complaint the surface screen is too easily scratched	0
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
this phone a has very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
features speakerphone the radio all the work perfectly	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same name but they all have a different name	0
and of all my calls were loud first clear unlike with sprint	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i have been using this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
this machine is replacement your desktop	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
contrary to what ive with the g does sync at of a second read elsewhere third party flashes just as it does dedicated the with flashes from canon	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i love it	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
there is no speaker grill to offer provide any protection to the driver	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the internet functions of the phone wap used gprs will only work through t mobile is services because to network deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone they be and on a different have	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i have to say i am even more pleased with it	1
i nt had time to push this player the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory should be expected from creative labs	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was spent a few hundred dollars on very unimpressed	0
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
however my hard drive did fail and hard i have not dropped it once	0
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
i highly recommend it	1
i m giving you a cautious recommendation	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
even setting the volume to max and leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
i could tell this was a cheap phone as soon as i set it up	0
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
well at all it had good power but no precision at all	1
no one rrb power adapter a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is sells	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
i was a little disappointed in low end	0
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
capacity storage	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel hard to beat the ipod	1
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value of on a variety for the money different sites	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
without having to go through the netgear to get the tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i do nt think really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that with the iphone bad	1

i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
the second is working just fine set	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and class that i have ever used	1
also the lens cap is design is flawed	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling it just the guest network things stopped working	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows nothing	0

the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a room with four bars all the time	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0

finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or set up in the first place or just is nd very usefu just is nt very useful	0

it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for	1
the typically problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its light and feel so comfy with it	1

it is crystal clear	1
this usb transfer is insanely fast	1

the world is small	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
gives canon g the tons of control for photo buffs but still has the auto mode that makes it very easy for an novice to use	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
for a small portable unit this allows one place you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
for a specific location i still dont know	1
i ve months now this for had and i am pleased with my decision	1
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1

i ve now for a week had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
ve i used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1

battery life the drawback this is to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
i am so in love with the silver look	0

the software you great as long as was have an adminstrative user account	1

one last note i this monitor with a higher than you can get in the states	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0

as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts myself as and both were bad	0
this is a great portable speaker system but to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing skin	1

i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
the phone is sound quality great do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
the speakerphone works better i any speakerphone than ve ever had	1
after using it for about a month i is the best i have ever used and can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
with great bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
however a phone call to the customer service crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
the problems came later	0
this product does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1

compared to everything else in this the this is most definately category best bang for the buck	1
great minds picture	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
avoid this model like the plague	0

it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1

there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure disk is a file system that store them in nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0

overall it is the best camera on the market	1

i tried to play the song three times with no success	0

my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
it is has a good signal strength weight and very light	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
you can of your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type manage display either list or tabbed	1
the grain was terrible	0
the damage is staggering	1
the aff feature did a great job of allowing the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen than the nx is green backlight did	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
the bass is a tad boomy and s a l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
for instance i made several back ups of my movies dvd using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1

i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
then easy the files is sorting as pie	1
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
the size is small	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
this is the third apex product i ve to and they continue bought impress for the price	1
