focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
it is a great camera for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to take a beginner into	1
that addition it only seems to about five feet if you re work away from the player although that may have been just the batteries in came with it	0
i the songs and add them found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
this is a great camera for you	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1

price gb of storage	1

i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the bass and treble levels perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1

i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
uploading the images to pc windows based my is very fast and simple	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0

the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
very convenient to bar scroll in menu etc	1
get it if you can afford it is woth every penny	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1

awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
awesome sound system	1

exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
this router is the best i have used to date	1
remote you can stand it on end and it get from amazon is far better designed than the s	1
the d works dir extreme n wireless router link fine as a n wireless router	1
other than that this thing great is	1
they are not wowable good	0
good news the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
features speakerphone the radio all the work perfectly	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge it of a computer	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little scared of technology and you just want a router to get you up and running so you can do basic networking and not have to play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this	1
their machines but i consider nice quality pretty low now	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that be able to read almost you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
in all for the money d say this is a decent router i	1
a hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
storage supposedly it is slow	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
not plug play relies on i d no fm or or turn recording	0
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
d link support was polite tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
back exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
playlists can be created made on a variety of different the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because technology is used in the zx than ipod more expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is involved with ipod than z different less expensive z but keep in mind that this is because technology is used in the zx than ipod more expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is involved with ipod than z different less expensive than the ipo but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
i wake up and everything freezes	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
slow gui be prepared you wait approximately seconds every time to change one items the sub menu of and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
the g looks like a work of art	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
great colors pictures and balance white	1
this player everything else seems to work fine with everything else	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to at my vista pc reboot least twice not fun	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
connection to the device is so easy easy	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
at the very least a sturdier and more durable carrying case would be nice	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the out of poor manual	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
the player has its minor o my li the player ha glitches like for example when i turn it on percent wont turn on at all and keeps shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my li of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is own quirks and glitches like for example when i turn it on it wont turn on at all and keeps shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my likingsthe playe not to my likings	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
convenience because it works through the internet the usb port	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
for a price that is still less than the lowest level ipod was able to get this gb monster the best part is it works as great as it advertised then some	1
for the price it costs is a well spent investment	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads	1
the monitors they were both good	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
is hard to beat at any price	1
tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a portable hard drive albeit one on which can create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i have nt had satisfactory to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the creative are time as should be expected from nomad labs	1
both the black black speakers and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
zoom goes up and down but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the scroll is a bit of a pain	0
granted i have only used this dvd player for my mom about this dvd player setting it up for for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with hours	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
to be a great buy find the apex ad i	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
the cover that came with the book with it did nt fit very well	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
all i can say is that this is devise	1
lasts a long time i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
all in all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
the also player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i m extremely happy that i bought this camera	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
normal size are minor the feel and layout only the remote control to of so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back are weaknesses	0
this unit was working fine for the then month and a half and st the color signal disappeared	0
i not m very happy with this machine or acer	0
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
course was hesitant the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it a second as a christmas present for my parents	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your products support is equal to that	1
the phone is dead small light and very attractive	1
had it a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
is sound quality my only significant complaint	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
but this one is great	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and be using it often	1
battery life is very good i use it day and i have to it every or days or so	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
the sound quality is really good	1
i can do this very easily to two different android phones	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking the bass to spend on computer speakers	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
its focusing system is very flexible	1
the setup process for the nomad with the player infuriating and the interface is is sub par	0
changing brightness easy with four presets one user changeable lrb i that at minimum brightness for at night	1
easy to use contained in the install drive	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
buy a high quality scan player for a relatively low price	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i would recommend	1
many of these movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
these speakers are	1
so far the router has worked well	1
is phenomenal	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software not is awesome	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
after nearly pictures to say i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
to only complaint i have is it when you push in the scroll wheel the select you have to push straight in or that sticks	0
setup from being fully in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
headphones suck i would invest in a new pair some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
well it had good power but no power at all	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
the woofer is much larger	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
silverish the color really adds a special touch	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the other key features afp relaxnew the sensibilities	1
premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be compromised	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around app in this device	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1

the sound quality very good is very good	1
the storage capacity is great	1
has unproven battery life also it	0
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
nomad with the the main problem jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the router recognized easily and further setup was a breeze	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i have owned this camera for a nt time and would short give it up for anything	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times for the fact that it gets when there are quieter talkers on the other end for the fact that it is a little too quiet at times for the amount of talk that it gets when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the lin of the line	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
seems like a good	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
however when went blank i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
easy hook to up	1

this product is hard to beat at any price	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the touch screen is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0

last night i needed to reset the router	0
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
the quality of the lcd screen is great	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
seems like a good product	1
see the detail in the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the for money apex machines have good features	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as to	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can keep up with demands t	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1

i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and eax the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0

it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
easy to hook up	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0

i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
they claim to respond in a without period yet it is been weeks hour a reply	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the root cause of the problem which was that the d link driver failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
this was very prompt standard shipping	1
