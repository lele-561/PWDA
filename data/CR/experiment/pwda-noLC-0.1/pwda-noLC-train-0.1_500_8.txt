the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1

the also player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
after multilple tries one of the disks finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a and always got a busy signal	0

music organization is id based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
a little more complicated navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen the hang of it and are comfortable xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
had a jvc system that was years old and thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks over screen is cool and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage bright the ipod	1
i ve now for a week had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
when the player said it was great but	0

by is this far the nicest one in so many ways	1
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
what is missing from creative is a cd burner	0

the eax features are pretty as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0

however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the rest of the process so i dont think it was a problem	1
my gut tells me the nomad worst in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at will a companies expensive lesson in very never to buy products from again	0
the zen stores be files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened data programs to or launched from its disk	0

it is very solidly built and has a nice and sturdy dense feel to it	1
the eax mode that keeps in handy the volume laptop on long at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1

the sound this slim design makes	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the wobble picture and sound is top notch	1
i love that it is a touch screen and it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1

i m sure it certain level would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional mode enabled instaled otherwise other the extra memory option netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1

it has a touchscreen and is loaded with features	1
the speakers are nice no question about that the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the pictures show how are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly noticeable difference but there is no difference in working with the files	1

first my impression was positive	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get think this is the best dvd player you can get for the pric for the price	1

i have done this many times and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1

the router recognized my other wifi router very easily and further setup was a breeze	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
however once you crank the volume a little i a level a bit too distracting for the work to like to get done with some background music viola the relative is great lrb well this is audio great for a computer speaker rrb	1
minor complaints though even the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the player ratings are also flawed	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1

it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed we up well on this baby	1
headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
yes effect there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it what you see in the pictur that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly avoid ot the picture	0
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
now that i own it however i stop thinking about it can t imagine being without it	1
works the sound is very good and but well on my portable speakers	1

quite simply the firmware frankly i think and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
as it stands now the usb port is pretty useless unless you re packing the whole thing up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
this router is awesom but it will contaced support support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i only they were very nice secure tried to to get it no right but thre best working avail bottom line if you is well worth the money have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very and this router just	1

second the menu system and controls and third are poorly designed	0
which did nt want one in lrb i would have to put in rrb myself i that is a pain batteries i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1

can it because help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for technology and deserves a lot of credit doing what it was designed primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
but if you re looking for the opinion of my apex dvd player i love it	1
this camera also has great a feel and weight to it	1

second gripe in the or so months since we have been using these monitors is that our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of noting album shuffle etc is standard on it is worth all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1

one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to and fro	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it does not have a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
also the case carrying doesnt open case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0

i started downloading and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake or if you stop for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling bit misleading to put out fires	0
