great colors pictures and white pages	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have used with or much more compact and the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the only minor nits i have camera are it is fairly boxy looking it a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0

the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
and is not reliable the connection constantly dropped	0
was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to set the router at so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the about her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1

contrary to what ive read party elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third i read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from cano party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the battery is nice	1
for instance i several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and and it plays the dvds	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it was able to play dvd and had a full fill of files	1

i have than had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone not any i ve used before	1
i am not to sure if this will work with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1

while i had the phone the earpiece features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and positive	1
multiple play modes tracks order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1

it is for the buck the most bang out there	1
the ipod nano is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1

because it you to can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i do of always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing nt i d tags	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
the larger lens of the g gives better gets quality in low light and the times optical zooms picture you just that much closer	1
however speed reliability power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
additional features	1
so if be re game for a little fiddling you may you very pleased with this day forecaster	1

just received this camera two weeks ago and already love the features it has	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when to going the menu	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you to match the sound you are listening to which can be a big hassle	1

playlists can be made on the fly without the aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing playlist you can also create your own playlists or playlists	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1

the light auto correction is awesome	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd ipod nano	0
i wake up and everything freezes	0
i am able to keep it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
this phone has many other features ir just to view as the most beneficial one the features above i name	1

i no had have problem what so ever with this product	1
i did nt get any wierd other speakers but i did get some from the sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
there is also no height adjustability so it will always be very low to the desk	0
the function lever the one which between capture and view mode switches feels fragile	0
the software and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about to any one of my cds	1
again the sounds the and projected from where they should were spot on front of the tv	1
because the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1

the canon computer software used to download and upload and manage your digital pictures on the internet is very nice and very easy to use	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is to be expected because all i really want is something to work with my iphone	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players play that can at almost everything you throw at it	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is with it the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
now there one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the creative labs xtra has all the features the i game has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player the creative labs ixtra	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive and a portable music player	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good to on a portable mp player sound result in a good product	0
does gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but the nt wash my car	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
the colors everything are great	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0

no games it has a cool screen use it why not use it	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big at a level of decibels of much of a difference at a level of decibels of a certain level a disturbance	1
if have netbook expectations will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
i have been using used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
setup software for my application i found the software setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
when i turned the phone on this phone the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
is this an excellent value	1
i just it up manually is very easy	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the build quality is top notch	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you nt hear a thing	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1

simply this product was created and was left behind	0

mediasource machine did not install on my personal notebook	0
the canon software for raw images does not present you does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image settings in the camera the default setting for the canon camera does not show you araw image the canon softwar with a the default setting for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image settings in the camer raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek is as windows mediaplayer looking effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
the second set is working just fine	1
i have yet to try using all adjustments shutter priority aperature priority light metering of the adjustment options etc but all controls are and and well thought out the manual is relatively clear	1
well backlit keypad	1
i a lot use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
the speakerphone works better i any speakerphone than ve ever had	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
it is a little cumbersome you scroll through so many levels to get to the selection to want	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
speakerphone	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a just lot of noise	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with the results	1
coming from the speakers had a loud audible tone the first set i received and had to be returned	0

instead are average so just use your regular pair the headphone earbuds	1
like it is predecessor relatively intuitive quickly revised nx this player that a decent size and weight a the navigational system boasts categorizes based on i d tags and excellent sound	1
fired away they and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
i use this amazing and it is with a home theater system how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
i read i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
this find i to be a great feature	1
my biggest problem ipod with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
your m sure and would it can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need i volume to be at a whisper	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone tiny cute feels kind plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
this camera is closest being a megapixel camera to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
is it running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and i would would nt give it up for anything	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is it incredibly easy	1
you have to nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
i should ve all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
every time i tried to connect the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again again and again thanks	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
what a disappointment	0
on my portable speakers the sound is very good and works well but	1
the standard battery the g with include is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
price wise zens are unbeatable i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and naturally	1
the sound this slim design makes	1
i less than a month it until it broke but loved is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
my only significant complaint is the key sound quality	0
great value great investment	1
nice machines but i consider quality pretty low now	0
the sound that like this came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
this phone is a winner	1
i to be very find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
first of all my calls were answered unlike with sprint	1
i am quite happy with it	1
i took me tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
irreversible ca nt that upgrade is you	0
i have nt had time to really push it to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are a bit of a mess as should be expected from creative labs	1

after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the size is a little bit bigger a little than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
i recommend a nokia highly	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you overilluminated get main subjects with depth being lost	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as been working well	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a quality camera that takes great pictures yet would be easy to use and does nt take weeks to figure out how to operat good digital camera that takes great pictures yet would highly does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1

feedback on creative is product support and this is not limited to the zen it can be extended to all the company is products	0
tech was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i ve had it feels like it this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
range of functions as above has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for are serious about	1
this phone is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to get rid of your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds i did my old front speakers	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and	1
this player seems to is going work fine with everything else	1
because is this camera beautiful	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the excels as a cell phone phone is as good thank god	1
however i do not like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
living in a small college apartment the but s and e s were beautiful e a bit overkill for what i needed	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we go back and had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the turn it on we had to use router because the gui one would nt work	0
so still it now plays everything you just can t see it	0
camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
great colors pictures and more white balance	1
i was willing go to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on how to install it on my computer downloads for apple computers	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i is player either not connected or busy	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits in your hand and can fit into any pocket without falling out	1
i find it the other apps i use pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the format matter no	1
it worked never has	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
great value gb ipod for the pricegreat value great gb i	1
the setup recognized my other wifi devices easily and further router was a breeze	1
recommend i would strongly recommend this product	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get the best viewing angles and consistent contrast	0
it was a snap to set up and my ps ps ps netbook eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
speakerphone speakerphone	1
rude and unhelpful support technical	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when can instantly delete pics you do nt like that not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
changing brightness easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
was very easy setup	1
the set up is goof easy to use proof and offers a superior result	1
x this is nice	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
ordered this computer she is a teacher so she a small computer would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a user to modify the data structure nor does it allow files to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really to rate it based on players in a different class	1
it is slightly lighter than h and comes the g and packed with even more features	1
i love my shirt or pants pocket fact i can carry it in the and forget about it	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
quite simply the firmware frankly i think and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i have would liked	0
very compact and portable just as described with great build quality	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files fact that there is an stored on cd rs dvds	1
i am using in my office and they	1
good speed range	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
other than that this thing is great	1
best since i ve bought electronic i was born	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fell out	0
as it stands now is case the pretty useless songs you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your unless beforehand	0

the controls the in harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten price to them and even at are beginning did not think would justify the huge difference somewhat use	0
will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
does what it should and does it well which seems fine to me	1
last night i turn off needed to reset the router	0
with gb of storage have i about songs on the player with room for about more	1
having spent considerable time with find the professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
used the interface could be better designed	0
the ihome is stereo reproduction audible is clearly superior	1

this other things where we dont know what the we keep trying to figure it out and we think that maybe just maybe if we kept trying something it will work when it did not wor has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
oops online to go easy and adjust it there	1
are not wowable good they	0
however when plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
but this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
great quality picture and sound features	1
door the story broke after a month	0
the quality is excellent	1
anyway is a great deal i really love it	1
i think this is is biggest flaw it	0
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i use it so it does nt bother me too much	0
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
way less expensive the than ipod	1
replaceable user battery	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up	1
size extremely small easy to carry and and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
gps the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend one now	1
seriously i it	1
quality quality quality	0

other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb a surround system rrb not anything the screen although there is reflection but i only really notice it you the display is off in which case you see when own reflection on like	1
great price	1
this is the best phone i have seen	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough workspace issues you ll forget entirely about that	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all worked to work apex dvd players and none claiming	0
its ability to serve as a sort of back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
the reason i rated it a four is of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to reeves k quote	1
the battery life is amazing	1
they will not respond my emails the phone line is constantly busy	0
now that i have it however i can t imagine being without it	1
great quality picture and features	1
it is small	1
however it has the potential to deliver on quality	0
the poor design continues with the case	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the with the windows open time	1
overall i lufton like the unit	1
what convinced me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd and that i would get my fill of files	1
i called the tech support and called they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
very bad news	0
best camera ever use it for from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and have to charge it every or so	1
the function lever the one which between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
some features in the user interface	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
without a i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
just an average user getting in this product good value	1
sooooo much it holds and music and audio files	1
i m still very sound with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i switch to open up my sound card every control panel is time i have between music and videos or games the frustrated is much more acceptable	0
product like a good seems	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
connection was in good no came with easy to use set up disk condition have added had to re we the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet item shipped out quickly on her laptop nt security benefits neighbors set longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
i highly highly recommend it	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
is very good	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
loved the design	1
the auto focus is a bit of a pain but i love having the optional scene modes they have they are very useful and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
over for the price this is a good deal unit	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip it is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the so are laid out normal keys there is no guessing	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
quite bulky and uses although not very solid heavy battery a as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the speakers and perform very well with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and and easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters to improve image qualit powerful features to include flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters to improve image qualit well made and and easy to take and and quick to usevery flexible and powerful feature the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
thought the software was decent enough it was nt to learn at	1
very convenient to scroll in menu bar etc	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
the pictures razor are sharp even in macro	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful too small but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
was great the theory well but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows camera to focus in low light	0
is excellent quality picture	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here i think is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
i will never use all the whistles and bells machine this is capable of	1
this phone built good with a huge array of features is into it	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and er s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it volume you is all right because these are computer speakers	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g use very comfortable and friendly to use	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item as it saves me from lugging all my stuff from the gym to work to the gym in the car etc	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily recommend it to anyone who is fed put up with the amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily recommend it to anyone who is willing to put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limit cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
i cant wait till i got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
be black it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
usb network storage it is slow	0
the standard battery with is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only the shutter it trigger does it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1

the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
same story as last time when trying to get service from apex court	0
i would like give it stars instead of i gave a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
my experience with this monitor was very poor	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0

it will only move to side lrb down or tilt feature	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures very impressed i took	1
for the first few weeks was everything i expected it to be an affordable format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete list of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to the main menu	0
at ounces it is a little bit light but not as light as the ipod	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was a bug in the firmware or if it is a fault of the router	0
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0

the scroll wheel is a bit of a pain	0

having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0

for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
wish the web on it is nice as well i just surfing there were more wap pages available	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of methods and can get a video signal from the machine	0
they claim respond in a hour period yet it been weeks without a reply	0
i have been using it for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1

i paired can do this very easily to two different android phones	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll purchasing consider one more of these super displays	1
they should have made the player out of hard plastic put some rubber on the corners	0
perhaps the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by simply opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the best in class sound	1

it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different technology is used in the zx than ipod more expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is involved in the zx	1

creative mediasource software is from scratch ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i was using used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of get to menu items all the way down to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0

anyway this player is a great deal really i and love it	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking on the left side of the screen the right side takes up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select the up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0

avoid this one like the plague	0
i am very happy with it so far	1
battery life is very good i i it every day and use have to charge it every or days or so	1
yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
if you a cd title to rename want that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
overall i like	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with the old one	0
after about an hour it starts skipping like it is are doing	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
money very good value for the money	1
i getting am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never very impressed seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
the build quality feels solid it playing nt shake or whine while does discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
is fine the dvd player	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates and we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1

that i it however i can t imagine being without it	1
i love the quality	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
no propietary headset jack	0
and it has sooooo much music and audio files	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small speakers	1
kind of bulky the wheel is but i can deal with that	0
the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton different equilizer type deals on here	1
as a matter of fact the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
colour excellent range of metering options as well	1
when i moving outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt took the photos were awesome	1
as a portable battery pack player it should feel a bit more durable	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
the menus the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from choose from instead you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
well it had good speed and accuracy but no precision at all	1
it looks great and is loaded with has a touchscreen features	1
well within days video output quit working	0
the midrange is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
i m delighted product this with	1
setup was easy	1
the fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load all of my music onto this unit	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
the build quality is excellent	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup those emergency pics you have to have	1
this product is hard to beat	1
the sound quality exceptable very is	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound cd played but with a dvd i got the audio no picture	0
i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
i found it very useful for transferring large files from one computer files to another computer	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features and currency converter like a stopwatch	1
the hands is quite powerful speakerphone free	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port is great a little while ago it really and the picture was awesome	1
i have had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
this is the best dvd ever seen player i ve purchased	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to mb s has been around it even when in the same room	0
creative zen feedback suffers from problems quality poor jack support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about construction with the headphone product	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
it is more than days matter what i do it will always be in the picture no matter whati d and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
the quality is excellent	1

my wife is even more than me pleased due to its widescreen	1
software is easy use	1
i for about purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
from t mobile is very good too	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
i just had to suck it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
the player plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not a dvd stopping a particular point a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
the final insult is that while this router download with useful software an pay sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to comes the trial software from the internet then make to additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use with a good range of features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i had i the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works from doing what it was supposed to do it works better than my own laptop so i will change t better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of standard the quality that you would from a is true line out jack	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb is very easy to set up as it is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i do nt know what other people are saying not working but the software is awesome	1
all in all this is a very has option for anyone who good a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
other than that this thing than that is great	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
however if speed reliability and power job for you to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
with the lack of a knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much easier to use so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
i do nt know what other people are saying is the software but awesome	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player probably the best out there	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
the reception and sound quality of the speakers quality are top notch	1
i love the bass this thing has and i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is good	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
in addition it only you that work if seems re about five feet away from the player although to may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
still i looks willing to overlook those things as this unit was sleek and has a myriad of features	1
just average user getting good value in this product	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because following reasons great of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and texting options great battery life and access to my corporate email	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
and it works great too	1
another at a more technical point of note the battery life is incredible	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
does what it should and the sound seems is just fine to me	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs more than acceptable	1
its easy to go online and check itll	1
i the storage in this thing	1
but after days the sound worked but the video did not	0
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
great to use for all the features	1

but itself which should be user friendly was anything the interface software easy to use	0

the prints are beautiful	1
those who are used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
it is extremely light and easy to carry in your pocket	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0

the zen stores data files but does not store them in a folder structure nor does it have a file system that allows documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
not a good idea as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if gear in the case you load up all your songs beforehand	0
but the sound good very is and works well on my portable speakers	1
color the screen is good	1
p it would not recommend is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard deficient all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not on in this matter	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are sounds a bit unnatural even with the sound turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speaker computer speakers	0
the labeling of the product itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
sub woofer large is	1
from indoors picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
while my laptop and netbook have built in speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
this model router has now failed me in the short span of time mentioned	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice with but is always a display of the zoom size that one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen about interferes there viewing at most settings	0

the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the shot when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
i m quite happy with choice of my new speaker bar	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
mediasource is an application user interface serious with flaws	0
user features in the some interface	0
this has happened with several things in the past and i dont know what it different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it work again and again did not work one time before	0
this was very prompt standard shipping and handling	1
what is wrong with this thing	0
these have speakers great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel construction of the s	0
i just set it up manually which very is easy	1
i am so happy with the camera	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1

setup was very easy	1
the its x optical setting is acceptable for of however shots that i take	1
it is a type of plastic	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can get a lot of sound and not get much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro not actually on the bike straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
and i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds unfortunately now the player can t play everything	0
a lot i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of	1

with gb of storage i have about about on the player with room for songs more	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put about half of the dvds i put in i in it	0
at the very least a the very least sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway traffic	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
they are not the same	0
then sorting the files is rest of the data easy as pie	1
difficult navigation i wo nt but say difficult necessarily i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
if you have netbook expectations will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1

the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
the only thing i do nt like about this cover the is does suck	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking needs instead of a neck strap it is a bit slow between shots	0
while i like the performance of not hesitate to buy the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon fact that i am confident of the the apparent indestructibility of it	1
in the hands of it nt someone who does will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
it is easy to use and is it seems feature complete	1

both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
usb for fast data transfers	1
this has growth and you ll be able to adapt so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
the world volume	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1

its far more difficult to select and has easy to use on the fly creation as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc contact lists numbers address like the ipod	0

hate apex but love amazon and i	0
the hell is wrong with this thing	0
it does have wo but it a lense cap nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
also it was only with a small amount of money and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of course	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for money	1
even better you do nt have to batteries about constantly replacing worry	1
the zen stores its disk files but be not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to does launched from data	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for based class that it is in and it is not to appropriate really rate it the on players in a different class	1

sub is smallsub is large	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included cable	0

one bad thing is that it comes with it and for most purposes a pitiful mb compactflash card is not enough	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions worth it sin asked replacement warranty will in the long run but the price will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days the most part no questions asked replacement warranty will in the long run but the price will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou be worth it sinc which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
what is missing from creative is a cd burner	0
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on quality dvds	0
very lasting long battery life	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the right side of the screen the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0

it stock tracking has a also app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0

although the nokia hardware a little to on the features department it is an outstanding piece of is for doing what it primarily was meant short do to be a wireless telephone	1
this color screen makes the free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
looks fantastic too esp w iphone docked	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
the top that the battery poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0

the cover that came with the book did nt fit very well	0
the results are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having the bones dropped just for this router i was very unimpressed	0

months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
i think the real reason makes more sense to use that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1

and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1

this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
mid range isnt the best weve heard but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0

it is made of plastic	0
upon opening these i found them to be very well made small but having a solid feel to them	1
cheap construction they should have made the on it player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the sound is excellent the sound quality is excellent the battery life is good the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod nano	1

i think the real reason made the changes that it now uses gpu hardware	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software quality easy to use wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
i ever got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1

now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged and works the next day	0
normal size are minor the feel and layout only the remote control to of so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back are weaknesses	0
the quality of communication setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you left the room	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera is a nice touch i ve seen	1

the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1

things are much more distinct and i do nt have trying strain my brain to not strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
however you do it you get what you pay for in reliable products	1
the hair is so soft you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
for most part the the money apex machines have good features	1

although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good user experience	0
when you put this phone in your so you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh pocket light	1
made really what this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
first the cons a tad does not the most asthetic looking player and bulky nt support a folder stucture	0

i get to chapter it and everything freezes	0
what i do nt like is music listening tonal qualities at lower volume that are very poor	0

i in love with this camera it ease of use with an immense amount of options power	1
are the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
mp is about right for the target size of this camera	1
the life battery drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded the mp files in to organize your songs	0
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through many levels to get to the selection you want	0
the top off covered the battery kept poping that without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
fm receiver it none	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0

i apex called is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
i love like this player	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re a new one looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
so all software as with yes bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
second gripe in the or so months returned to the manufacturer returned to us since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0

the screen is large and bright	1
this i love honestly player	1
is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy to you tend if take photographs from a distance	0
this is a and piece speaker system for a computer great it is worth every penny	1
ripping the songs even with is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
longer battery life greater accessibility social media and music services and pc compatibility are the main goals to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you a lot of control over your photos excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings yet yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide a lot more control overyour photos excellen latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide a lot of control over your photos excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
all the buttons and all the neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
best camera ever from the image quality color i can say almost everything	1
the pc sync feature superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
contrary to a ive g elsewhere the read does sync at of what second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
this is better than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the data when i need it rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
picture quality from indoors in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs ring annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular and	0
should is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you the screen be able to swap it out	0
amazon was very nice about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
for hours working with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i fully expect it to go bad in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
i started files and transfering accessing to find it to be extremely slow	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to be able to answer their emails and telephone number is listed as the one lonely customer service number i think the rep is probably extremely overworked	0
key instead	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in of your arguments to be the least	1
mp is about right this camera the target market of for	1
changes but canon never fails to amaze	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
the sound quality is really good	1
the buttons on the thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the only thing	0

software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing the performance is nt the greatest the search funtion is nn fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut https www google com store apps details id https a it with the hotkey shortcut	0
this is a very light phone a little less than with long battery life	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i dont like is the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at i depth can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of things you can do with it that i have nt even gotten to	1
does what sound should and the it seems fine to me	1
having access to so much music where go is terrific	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does is a nice touch but not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
i thought software the was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card again every time i want to switch between the two the quality of the sound is much	0
update the finish is more mirror like i wanted and i like it	1
the controls are somewhat more difficult to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would be able to use them due to the huge difference in price	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
works out great	1
best in class performance	1
is a good dvd player this for the most part	1

i have also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
i m still very frustrated with some the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i open up my sound card is control panel every time i between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0

we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0

i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i has and you get if from amazon your going to pay for this great player	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
size bigger than the ipod	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i where because that is like my thumb is the i hold when thing	1
the company offers a range of metering options as well	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and use it to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping files into it	0
i wish there my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
speed usb means fast data transfers	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
it is and light extremely dissapears in your pocket	1
the image quality excellent is	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
it has and is much faster very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1

and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
its fast forward and rewind work i than those of other models much more smoothly and consistently ve had	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only turn on the speakers and use the microphone and the speakerboom feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is on	0
billy joel was nt kidding when said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
very bad quality	0
might the price and specs this considering be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
had a jvc system that was years and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound amazing	1
made the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
i only have one complaint and that is that	0
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply occasionally caused to which not turn on	0
this of was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i guess that limited time on the warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranties	0
route to also it was very easy to other wamp servers thanks to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1

unit suddenly it worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for the price	1
the software is sucks	0
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is one of the best brands in cellphones	1
can way either t go wrong with this price	1
other things that i miss are a headphone jack and a standard mm headset jack	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not play in order they play one after another like on a cd	0

for the price it is a well spent investment	1
i have used this monitor for few months and have had no problems	1
the included eax support is useful it times especially when you listen will a variety of genres as at to adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1

you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button can be turned on and off this can be really helpful if shooting focus on focus on and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting focus on focus on a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
it is more than days and it not does show the picture no matter what i do	0

is scroll wheel the a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
i am bored with the silver look	0

bottom line well made camera that is easy easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
you can adjust the focus range to suit your shooting style with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a subject that is tough to automatically focus	1

i find the lack of respect for women quite disturbing	0
it does not only have trouble playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
connect the player to your xtra open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtrail	1
bright visible view this screen	1
it to be placed the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
when i tried to the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0

the software on the router pretty good	1
is very good the price	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or similar way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is not very good	0
the is alot better than most the phones out there	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not been able to recover it	0
you can stop using rrb if you want this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1

no way to contact their customer service	0
the phone is sound quality is good and i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1

connection to the device is getting access so easy	1
overall i like the unit	1
same story as everybody else when find a job trying to get service from apex nothing	0
both dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter the player kept going	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and support having just dropped the bones for this router i was unable to use it very unimpressed	0
unit worked great video output weeks then for failed	0
video output format	0
i just purchased this and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
on my main computer it just did not work right	0

you i love this monitor	1
it has a usb port so you can usb thumb plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1

although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable cd or mp player to result in a good product	0
i i got it home when discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
and so any of the players far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1

my other big complaint about it is the stand	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy which remote is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
also lightweight very light and portable	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork out of grad school and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the speakers are nice no question about that the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
navigation system the zen music player uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the off on the phone goes backlight way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0

this is absolutely terrible	0
i tell that could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
i quite my new bar	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0

these speakers have great sound but they will headphones buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
the picture the sound and is clear bright and sharp is good	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is a great alternative to a good cddb service	1
i like this player	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even better than the ipod	1
the connection is not reliable constantly dropped	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
image sharp	1
i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are poor	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
the mount is easy to put on the bike it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
also list the cds in alphabetical order i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
it is great to switch to lcd for the metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
trumps support from congress is literally nonexistent	0
this is the i phone best have seen	1

slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time a few seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minute you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
the on button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
portable	1

the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent the battery is excellentthe battery is goodthe price is excellent	1
when the player it working was was great but	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
battery life is	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they are in the game	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too high the sound is a bit harsh for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great	1
volume level is ok	1
and with a simple app transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
i do not think it is the quality of the picture that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the screen has an extremely bright screen and its design allows for the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
the combination of this player price storage size and player features makes the the best on the market	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and a little bit of everything this product delivers both	1
apex this model will not work with my universal remote control	0
keypad well backlit	1
the windows premium is good and do nt recommend starter rrb lrb user friendly	1

this camera on in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
a hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
is the creative software however not real intuitive	0
so if you re game for little you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
anytime we changes to the router we had manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt	0
all in all suprisingly easy easy to use	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has been written about this	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet has all the features the printer comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet trial version i have t trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock th then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock the printer comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock al all the features	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and lock out an awkward tiny little be button that needs to has depressed to turn on the camera	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the only drawback is the speaker is not very deep and is very thin	0
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
the picture quality is amazing and you if connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way can you wanted to	1
however for a budget i think this is an excellent choice camera	1

the world the size is small	1
the sound from the player not audible is ok	1

great product my perfectly for works office	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0

a great affordable system at an incredible price	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features more experienced that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
i selected the right away and have gotten a new set of pictures every time	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard and mouse broke	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w still it and sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned is but it all the way down all right because these are computer speakers	0
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid new and pcs all connect without issue	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and any find can song playlist etc fast enough	1
the speakers have a very rich you and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which sound would need a huge subwoofer	1
i just purchased this phone and think i this is the coolest phone i ever had	1

slr like programming and exposure control gives you be creative yet its and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the	1
paid than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected get a good quality product these random disconnects kills for me	0
however shareport was the best on this new router worked of the time	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
also another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
i cant believe like the size and weight of this little critter	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best point and shoot camera available under	1
this product is hard to beat any at price	1
price	1

overall i like the system i have and performance	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule and i have no doubt that they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
other than that is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this	1
the sound is awesome but if you put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs the room very well	1
wo nt play football	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1

it takes about an hour to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes	0
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g sync at of a second with third party flashes just as does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
also the carrying case that though with mine covers up the display so even up the side controls are reachable i have to open it came to see the display	0
again were spot on and projected from where should the front of the tv	1
is hard to beat at any price	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn built in and produces spectacular images	1
great gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
to is nt any good becuase it either needs the quick sync be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world and need a phone with wonderful features	1
be for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera can end your search with the nikon	1
this very was affordable camera easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
i met not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily m and surpassed my needs	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting such as a room where you have a lot of people and only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
excellent am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice i speaker set	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have never been so happy with it	1

bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful enough to include the ability to use a variety of lens and lense filters choices	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it was a good deal	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and the mbyte cf with a mbyt that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
after using it a about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely huge for delivers bang for the buck	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not on the left side work well	0
i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound system	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to re looking for from have you to scroll up and down to find what you pick	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
after i rebooted the device it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i booted the device reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
i am using them in my office and they generally work well sound good	1
that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0

but when we went to use it again there was no sign of it but no picture	0
i spent on the phone with their tech support you connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and at least my imac and macbook back online	1

ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring sounds close	0
it has a nice color screen	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
when i turned the phone on the first that hit me is how good the screen is	1
i think that however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
on dvds so i cant get it to work it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0

having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1

charging for paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects lack of kills it for me	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
this is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make your own movies that way if you wanted to	1

not only features that is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1

not only have it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i is	1

it is just intrusive a nice light weight non such device which you can take anywhere	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me never at all	1
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
even better with the optional headset you listen to music over the integrated radio	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am much easier actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
this means that is a good chance this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
what makes the focus lag time can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams	1
i spent hours on that and i could spent nt connect to the internet	0
is okay but the eax can cause audio interference	0
great phone i d buy another	1
got a system error problem days after purchase	0

other tagging problems result the nomad is operating system	0
because this camera sucks is beautiful	1
i know this unit will and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which is me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra allows combination easily of price capacity and features meets those criteria	1
picture great	1
i m also running perfectly wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire in even through the groove in the of the base bottom	1
this router is phenomenal	1

the only thing i m the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0

slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the two the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0

the only thing that it really i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and i have open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or the sound is much more acceptable	0
however the phone problem to a d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a call	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine a gige link presented the router with and	1
the touchpad is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up a usb thumb drive from my various computers	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
it is also a bigger than expected that is ok because is something to work with my iphone	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this phone this product delivers both	1

software is absolutely terrible	0
i simply love pic this feature	1

you ll be changing your information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0

i selected the right away have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
an excellent choice for a budget i think this camera is however	1
network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
a great system at an incredible price	1

battery life hours beats ipod is	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
i fell in love with this app because it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
after months it playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
as it stands now the case is useless unless you re packing the player up for travel if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your files into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or genre tags as the zen does not recognize folders	0
software that the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
the service the supplier from was exceptional	1
is excellent audio	1
the however wheel is easy to use and works great for me scroll many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
the view larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos the computer on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
they are very sturdy well balanced and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
working hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
a tad the cons first bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
quite bulky and uses a lot of energy although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
they could could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are to use	1
the eax features are cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered or on a train	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention that they were polyphonic	1
about the nomad favorite thing my is the eax feature	1

for those be creative of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the lcd screen is	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything in the same room connected to it has been around mb s even when has	0
is working just fine	1
i found it very useful large files transferring for to another computer	1
very compact and this model portable just as described with great sound quality	1
chic look and good build player comes in form with a metal face plate	1
there is an app for it but i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
their network coverage is very experience sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
i with my new speaker bar quite happy m	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
after nearly pictures i have to say that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
d link does not provide mac support for this app however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible with this app	0
of the size is small	1
the scene mode works well that the remainder of shots for are not going to be in a regular setting	1
excellent is the image quality	1
also the computer player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
wanted them the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
samsung galaxy s has a major design flaw	0
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to find and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
i had no problems opening up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
with mediasource software so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer being	0
they do look cool in the video the dark though	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you the pictures take can with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains and also to listen to my track records	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
well working days the video output quit within	0
the best at an incredible price	1
for a while even i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
the is a trust very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
the player ratings are also flawed	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just are standing about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that weren t charged properly if you have any problems batteries that came with i the weren t charged properly if you have any problems batteries that came with it	0

this is the first time my router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any and all of my cds	1
there is a lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
i needed three batteries charge the g and i found to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
for the price and size and features you can t get anywhere else for the price	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the has the radio function which is used for	0
very life lasting battery long	1
i am using them in my office and they generally seem to be very good	1
overall i like it	1
there is an alarm i still used it yet nt have but it should be good	1
not the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of i d tags	1

however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they when i turn them on sound a little weak	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have not had to re set the router at all so far since it has been installed so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her	1

as a whole and has a sleek design the dvd player works fine	1
overall great speakers	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i it on have enjoyed it	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
the extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mp hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
great camera great investment	1
my overall experience with this my experience monitor was very poor	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
sound quality is very good the excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw on dvd r rw dvd w rw and dvd dvdr r and dvd r rw	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better very similar to the ipod than the ipods	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play some of the episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
i tried these speakers and found to preform well below expectations this price	0
it worked great and we just love it pluged it in	1
when you your player the player turns on really fast and continues to play as left it when you were turning it off	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is i think the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
price gb of storage	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
this thing great	1

criminal justice reform seems to be a major problem	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music be to potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
the mount is easy to use it hold the bike is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
weaknesses the feel and layout of the remote are so so it does the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0

it does not have an auto focus assist light which is very useful for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low traffic	0
they sound wonderful in the studio and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1

the mms technology will very well integrated with this phone which you is enjoy	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
works make it super easy	1
whether you re taking jog had the fm radio a waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you brisk	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that could i gave because the information i all	0
it is to through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent game	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find it to be a great value for money i consider this to be another brand that i can trust	1
the software is not good annoying either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the top that covered the any warning and the battery was battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna does as is the speed the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
but if you re looking for my opinion can vouch for it of the apex dvd player i love it	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with a few presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1

the setup process for the nomad with the player infuriating and the interface is is sub par	0
player this apex dvd well turned out great	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their support the fact that companies that offer customer willingness ability to support their customers and their to stand behind them	0
it plays basically every media i ve on my old sharp player even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played tested so far	1
the software is not good either and the annoying driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year not be worth it since it will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou no questions asked replacement warranty will most part the no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since i am sure the warranty will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
it is a bit more expensive than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player was kept going	0
this apex model will the only remote control that not work with my universal remote control	0

finally making downloading and playing the playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by genre except for the tracks which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical orde playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
either way can t go price with this wrong	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
you of course have to be familiar with the unit as well	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant poor calling experience	0
the app software is easy to use	1
forget about the sleek looks if play can t it some of your real dvds	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
the size is small	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up most of the screen and the user has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
navigation system i d tags that are embedded in the mp files organize your songs	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1

it sounds great out on the patio good to have or on my night stand	1
honestly i love this player	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and not work properly but it may be just operator error	0

the color screen is as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs the phone will only work through t mobile is services because network they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used network on a different network	0
looks fantastic too esp w iphone docked	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does a great job everything it claims	1
all in all this a great player that blows me away with easy to use and understand features software that is easy to understand and use and a great sound	1
nice little car very light compact	1
i also liked the fact that you the progress can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
a little hard to understand is the remote	0
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
this means there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture quality of the camera is mind blowing	1

and so far have not play any problems with dvds not being able to had	1
operate is another great misfortune hard to software does frequently screwed my music library up crashes nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
the final insult is you while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version an download to have the trial software from the internet then pay that additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the battery life is good	1
it the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far bought has been excellent	1
the setup process for the nomad and the interface with the player is sub par	0
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for price its	1
it is small	1
it had a more sturdy	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1

appearance is okayed	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
i guess that limited take warranty means it may lifetime a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
the color screen makes this after rebates phone shine bright and commands	1

as well as super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable price i paid for it given its features and specifications	1
the keyboard is also very nice and although it does take some getting	1
the has the radio function which unique is utterly useless	0

the screen is easily scratched but fine if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone wants a set of small effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1

the only problem i have is on the mouse pad the clicker is stiff	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0

then my dvds would stop playing after a few minutes in the middle or not even be read at all	0
while decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0

you of course have some good customization options with your phone as well	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
to keep it short this is a very good phone and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
i think the real reason for the change in the game that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down can give rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
are on my but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums from my library	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume and simple selector buttons	1
i have to say i for also pretty impressed by the user interface m playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
they are clears and perfect to be used in a boat along with a sub	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was made in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the rest of the process without a problem	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i a message saying im get now is player either not connected or busy	0
my one issue with despite is that the mediasource software pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
all in all this is a very good option anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
i simply love this feature	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
because it can help a so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
it is worth it	1
is on the cheap side material	0
the problem is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
i would will definitely not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
overall i think i like it	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and keyboard	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is really bad	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone buzzing sound and a strange coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
i dissapointed that acer was nt more	0
in addition it comes with and sleek a powerful headset	1
having spent considerable time with my laptop i find onscreen displays annoying	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
otherwise this player is unavailable awesome	1
wondering what happened and the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there large a for memory mp player	1
the software this one on the router is pretty good	1
great phone i d buy another	1
my wife is even more pleased simplicity due to its widescreen	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in a long time lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear images	1
but if you re looking for the opinion of my apex dvd player i love it	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
the g has a of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to charged while in the camera but the charging system enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
this is wonderful to for your first dvd player have	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then died it	0
i tried tried it out as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
it was terrible	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
the sound quality	1
on the positive side the sound of is once you have everything configured	1
so far i have and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
other than that place this thing is great	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
my first impression was text fitch rating positive	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor most important in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
i used to have one and did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
the sound level the price is also not as high as i would have expected	0
easy to use with clear contained in the install drive	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
there are	0
all in all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it would just spin up and stop and there would be no disc	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve had to deal with nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i m only had the player for a few days i leave room for doubt if the mouse and keyboard jack	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
i bought i about a month ago and i have to say my canon g am very satisfied	1
the second set is working well	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same name but they all have a different name	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is the problem horrible	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we we bought this router for our two computers	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the ks which are not listed but are listed tracks are listed individually and are organized by alphabetical order can be difficult because the cd which are listed separately and are ordered by the kd individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
possibly the advantage this has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
it anything this phone does does perfectly	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or a computer back ups	0
in fact each of them is the reason we had software problem in the first place	0
i try works navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the in the g is a real powerhouse	1
im on mine	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0

even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size new camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the quality of the sensor and the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
i have tried several times to contact them via email through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt respond to my emails and their website is always busy	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
i recommend this product to anyone	1
i bought a couple of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1

i office using them in my am and they generally sound good	1
the problems card from my video came	0
the sound quality are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
not it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
the ringtones i got are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
customer support website creative labs is useless	0
now that i own it however i can t stop thinking about it	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies and i put them on dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
in addition seems it only seems to work if you re about five seems feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
also the display is hinged and it can be placed on a table to display it or to protect it against any damage	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
lots of it but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make flaws a good buy	1
because camera is beautiful	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
first i ll start off by saying that this game players hardware is pretty good	1
its far the new ipod not a bit to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ip more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not a bit to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect interface like the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipo like the ipod	0
quite the firmware and or the that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i have been using it today it works great and has a great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume of my iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
second the automatic sync on review lets you creative the songs before it begins its transfer	1
everything sporadically great until it started dropping internet connection was	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i finally gave up and stuck with mediasource	0
player works and looks dvd if you can get the great is to play	1

reviews for positive are generally sound quality	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise ll uneasy	0

i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is broken and it is ruining my media	0
it is easy to use and easy for my grandmother to use	1
it has a few on a cd one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like inconveniences	0
issue the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0

it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
i just fine set it up manually which is very easy	1
apex samsung galaxy note is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
folders can not be created audio the for files	0
is looking for so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also cheap anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
coming from the speakers first set i received had a loud audible tone the and had to be returned	0
have used it frequently have had no problems	1
you do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme can even make your own apps games	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the auto setting does a great time most of the job but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is really robust what others have said though notmad may work better	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is not the best but it is fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
it is really good	1
usb network storage supposedly it is not	0
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera	0
i did yet not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
working for hours with it it on shuffle totally rocks	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
it light is enough to carry around all day without bother	1
if you are then go not picky about image quality go for it	0

music no id organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the camera has a number of features	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not with one or two qualities	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0

main dial is the not backlit	0
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but computer is incredible	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with a wide range of devices including sansas and ipods	1

all of these equipment international has done a great job on harmon the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
it easy is	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has desktop a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and desktop external speakers	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all and to work apex dvd players claiming none worked	0
technical support line the other hand was very helpful	1
the sound that came from the speakers sounded like carnegie hall	1
the device itself	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a lot better than the standard band eq	0
now i that have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
range was comparable to even or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
had a sound system that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
it gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes the canon g very easy for the novice to use	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on the road	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your vision	0
it will read and play all cd audio files	1
but anyway the only thing you does have voice dialing really look at here is the fact that the phone should	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
it is more than days and it does not matter what i do it will always be in the picture no matter whati do	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
i am very pleased far so with it	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the quality the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interrup in all room an product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly the product because you cant see the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interrup in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1

i wanted the product to work for me but it just did nt	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to social media and music services and pc compatibility are the main goals	1
the volume range is great so blast can you it if you want	1
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am not a fan	1

one beef is as scroll it does nt work the well as i d like	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is because these are computer speakers	0

this machine this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
the grain was terrible	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back in their chairs and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
a great value it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
although the phone nokia is a little short on the features department it is honest an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
so far the router has worked well	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player in my opinion was the software	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
i loved it until it broke but less a month is an acceptible period of time for to work	0
i have no complaints with you	1
in addition it its cheap and comes with a remote control	1
i do nt know what other people are doing with this but the software is awesome	1
drop usb drives into the portal and please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer wireless desktop desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
however if speed reliability and power to get a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
but you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
through found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver i the menus quickly	1
bottom line well made camera to to use very and flexible powerful features easy include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
as well one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
i called apex is support number it but numerous times just kept ringing	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
i have at all no complaints with this mp player	1
however the creative software is not real yet	0
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal to be desired	0

even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0

unlike some of the other people who a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
i will be able to use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
the and is very light and slim machine fits nicely into my tv stand	1
the keypad is a decent size but the keypad for turning on off key is small and difficult to press	0
after months it has started playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button remote on the remote control which is one of the simplest and to use remote easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
on the plus side the phone has amazing battery life	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product is killing me i bought this router due for my money but these random disconnects kills it for me	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy much more expensive remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
the on off button on the back of the camera is somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another on a cd like	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
excellent range of metering options well	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery very easy to use lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0

poor visibility on the keys	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
this camera has a design flaw	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the some people wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
i have owned this camera for over a year now and would nt give it up for anything	1
i m sure it certain level would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
this is a your data good deal for music and data storage	1
while the ease of use i put off by the price about more than i paid amazon for this player	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player wants to pay next to nothing	1
the macro mode is exceptional the colours are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
just an average user getting good product but you are value in this product	1
the too small storage capacity is great for me	1
amazon com has it how can you	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really notmad despite what others have said though robust may still work better	1
in short if you and just this router that is a little afraid of technology re you just get online a router to want do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day someone is great for you	1

also the player freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0

coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
apple is size bigger than the ipod	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it and it works great for admirably	1
the only downside is the fact that its a camera which requires a line of sight	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses the latest hardware acceleration	1
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my beer socks spills my but does nt wash my car	1

image great camera	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with agree others here about the quality of this speaker	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
the sync pc feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
best camera from ever the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
be prepared for a long wait it took about minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
one is this of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
i have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
portable	1
having unfilled i d tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
i would have rated it five stars but the poor manual	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
this has so many capabilities that have ll always you room for new technologies as they evolve	1
in a world where others say not bright enough	0
it is tall so i ended up laying on its side	0
the speakerphone the tv and radio all features work perfectly	1
nice and compact	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
you can lens the see barrel in the view finder	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
fine	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
great camera and for the price you get	1
due and the for of support lack whs upnp guestnetwork to having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
overall great speakers	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
their network coverage seems to be is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
then sorting the files copying and pasting is easy as pie	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely is the best i have ever used and a huge bang for the buck	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling i d when tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
i love this player	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
the auto light correction is awesome	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i	0
it did also not seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0

it does have a lense cap but it wo nt you take pics with it on which is real good	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
it still in the palm of your hand and is heavy	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely very light into my tv stand	1
volume level is ok	1
if come out hazy the pictures your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
i thought the software was complicated enough it was nt decent to learn at all	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs but the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
oh and saver the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
the canon software for raw images not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
of on the other end the person the call can hear you perfectly	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
very they are not wowable good	0
is it worth it	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting it to work once it is transferred	1
very easy set up	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was the the router failed negotiate auto to that ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window could so you could see the screen and if the a lot button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
is a tad boomy and s o w it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down it all right are computer speakers	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple overpriced ipod is	1
loved the slim design	1
even with a great game it is these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
make it super easy	1
would definatley a friend to recommend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
without having to go through all the trouble of going through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
overall i like it	1
the problems came from my old credit card	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
has it fm receiver none	0
is phenomenal this router	1
delayed delivery was prompt	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light feel so comfy with it	1
the good price performance looked just right	1
the is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button control on the remote control which is one nicest and most intuitive of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
my only complaint is like it it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when others here it because does does it so often	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
well was great but upon enabling the guest network stopped working	0
when i the second dvd player to install tried in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
seems like a good product	1
however for a budget i is this camera think an excellent choice	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
but i think it is perfect	1
i m with my zx pleased very so here is a quick review	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to to nomad jukebox the be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
at first i with this as was still really fast	1
this is a great piece for the price speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
in other words the zen is not it if a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need collection for your music collection	0
great and picture quality features	1
its a bit bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am bored	0
more powerful much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
i spent hours on that and i not get it to could nt connect to the internet	0
matter you can this level not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
it also excellent coverage through our two story house	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
do very simple to use	1
so that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
the sound is surprising to say the least with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
this was removed because it was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon and it was delivered on tuesday at pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
have this monitor a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
its annoying pay a lot of money when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0

seems good a like product	1
its focusing system is flexible very also	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
dvd am really impressed by this i player	1
it really easy to set out of the box and i got my wireless devices lrb desktop smartphones rrb to the internet in minutes	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the side is stiff	0
even with these shortcomings i still a great game it is think it is the best digital camera available under	1
the interface software itself which not only slow should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
when i got it home i discovered that the menu a message options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
remote you can stand it on end and the hair is so soft it is far better designed than the s	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker is amazing and makes it even great i love this phone	1
in camera summary i love this quality camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1

the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
the pictures are fabulous and i love this app the features their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a for the ease of use and ease because it has run well for me smoothly during the time i have owned it	1
on education its focusing system is also very flexible	1
portable portable	1
to up thuumbs acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
the combination of photo capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1

well everything seems to work surprisingly	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
site have tried several times to contact digital apex through their on line support i and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0

the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with headphones on	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would affect the way i play and it did	1

after using it i found the size to be perfect for have found carrying in a pocket	1
print small size	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when up with s connector	1
my new imac favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing data wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial version from the internet and then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter but it does if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
it has all features one would need in a cellphone	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and one i had before and it weighs a little mor it weighs a little bit more	0
say they look fantastic	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the images are quite impressive	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
protective case completely useless as is the truth since it obscures display window	0
i wished a little bit they could make the volumn that louder	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic in the hand but seems pretty sturdy	1

the screen daylight bright easy to see in the is with nice colors	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
would have been much nicer if it had a window you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
takes more excellent photos	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the music and the radi favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
slr like programming and gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
convenience because it port through the usb works	1
the scene mode works well for the kind remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r for all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd re r rw	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and have allowed gprs will only have been disabled work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable would you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to the sensibilities and pc compatibility are online music services	1

the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i nt after day	0
video output has stopped workin	0
nomad with the the main problem jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine apart from speaker for the amount i paid	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the link to the player does not work properly	0
office starter web cam is a fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for convenience	1
am starting a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0

i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged then told me they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge if i didnt want to pay me for repaing the damned thing	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1

multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc worth is on all jukebox players but standard noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1

i m sure what to do not very happy with this machine or acer	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
what is added in functionality vs what is lost in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0

the battery is amazing life	1
in all i d say the price this is a decent router for the money	1
megapixels is for anybody and the photo quality is	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player not a problem cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial case but this is not a problem for me as i use the case as the switch has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you us if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1

the screen is a little scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
the backlight will it happened i fail the first time periodically sent it in for warranty repair	0
this player seems to work really well with everything else	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i know this unit i think will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days be worth the money and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will been worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1

finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other that megapixel	1
the colors and everything are great	1
it did play some of the music which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i love the quality all of the pictures	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo but still has that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending it back	0
it nas the usb interface on the router to be used either for allows or print server	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells has to offer this machine is capable of	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
its ability to as a back up for my music collection is huge plus	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
the color is red and is so attractive	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0

it also costs a lot less other options than the ipod	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1

upon first looking at these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good this phone is	1
when i hooked it up it only produced the audio with a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0

for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies and i put them on dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1

the sun the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
i am not to savy with a computer but very is the d link easy to install and set up	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
it was easy enough to remove the front of the battery but the battery compartment was small and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
those i was willing to overlook still things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
this little camera has created myself between a marriage and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
all i can say is that this is devise	1

before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many mp players but decided on this one now that it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
bottom line it did it work the way nt was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
i really have no complaints at all	1
over all on which made us experience photography a fantastic very compact camera a totally new level	1
protective case completely as is it obscures display window	0
the phone is small and light and very attractive	1
first of all the player is is superior to the ipod	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
this is i the best dvd player ve purchased	1
without any tweaking at all if the i is accurate the exposure are as realistic as colors ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
very scroll to convenient in menu etc	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it enough for me to find problems with get the hang of it i have no problems with this d up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with get the hang of it i have no problems with this dvds playe this dvd player	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to	1
menu screen options appear one at a time taking up the whole the and one has to scroll down one by one or where memorized have they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
however a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
i chose the g because of its for very high quality clean images	1
the only problem problem that i have found with the internet service mls is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
also my previous player is a plus unlike navigating while playing music	1
just it up manually is very easy	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp ive ever played out there	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the by two being afflicted other a number of glitches	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
this i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the person the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
this is my first digital camera and i love how it is	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
this camera has a great feel and weight to	1
all has this is a very good option for anyone who in all a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard in the background so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
this camera was affordable to use and produces spectacular images	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
the camera is a dream to use as it not only shoots in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
the sound quality of these are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the potential to bring the price a bit down of course	0
the interface software itself which should be very user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
the service from the supplier to the customer was exceptional	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and at the moment and the hands free connector might be a proble the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
even better with the addition of a bluetooth headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
for the very it is a price nice dvd player	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the rubber mouse pad is stiff	0
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a x drive on my pentium pc with cd	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend a lot of money on computer speakers	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way it could be inserted	1
i found that a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
i find it too bright	0
if you are not picky about image quality go here	0
the battery life is amazing	1

the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the	0
turned out quite nicely fired away and the picture they	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job it up	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
it worked great and love it we just pluged it in	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
i have nt had time to really push very good this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from expected from a player creative labs	1
others may have such horrible viewing angles but i have never seen a flat panel with better luck	0
so no problems easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
been tampered with the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does some getting	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical chance american phones	1
having unfilled id tags will stored cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
the nikon coolpix wonderful is easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
it also means	0
it worked from to at which time the picture completely failed	0
i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
several was atrocious the interface elements simply did nt work at all	0
the quick sync is at all it either needs to be configured properly or just is nd very usefu nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you storage need for your music collection	0
i m delighted with this not happy product	1
easier is it could nt be fact to use	1
however for a budget i think this camera is pretty good	1
anytime with it enabled we made changes to of router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front the the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the other day when i was listening to it i got it locked up and will not do anything now	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
x zoom is nice	1
still i was long as it willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to cisco valet plus wireless hotspot the install in less than minutes	1
depressing that the system is not always responsive	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
one last note would recommend buying i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
the range is in the basement or in a basement four bars all the time	1
the speakers have a bass but there is very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
very bad news quality	0
the design is sleek and the color resolution has good screen	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand would recommend that i can trust	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
slow gui be to wait seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly being on the phone replacing batteries	1
color screen is not available good	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal loss	1

my house is so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1

took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but imo is a very user friendly player it	1
i was really impressed with how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
also the lens cap on this lens is flawed	0
another nice thing is that it has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before i bought it	1
i love these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
i think apex dvd the best is player you can get for the price	1

i dvd players looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the usual standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
i was willing to live with the small size but the durability was a big zero	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the battery life is great this is by no means a major advantage over the ipod	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital ays busy through their on line support site and busy their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0

paying for the return shipping was wonderful about picking it up the next day and amazon	1
i can do this very easily to two different android phones	1
first of all the quality and the sound quality player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
there are lots of interesting features eax and customization such as included	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1

here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels a bit plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens	0
not a bad monitor for is it but nothing special	1
great works	1
i found using mediasource to load your to the nomad jukebox be easier and faster than windows explorer	1
it would skip not play the song at all or either wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is one of the best out there	1
quality is very good it the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
it does nt have nt not a real complaint since most windows users do firewire generally have firewire cards themselves	0

this camera has on to find out more just log a cool stitch pictures feature to canon is website	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0

i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus are for those who advanced functions serious about photography	1
i it up only produced a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
and man i had to work songs to put my chinese songs on the player favorite chinese because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i took take	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one on a cd	0
this allows you to listen to as well as share in an intimate setting	1
and years with that carrier is expensive plans after horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0

they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box tech service the failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
very tight joints with a matte black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
no propietary headset jack	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were nice to have but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
the the are easy to navigate and menus buttons are easy to use	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts that long	0
to cheaper it short this is keep and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
the pc side software it be goofy and takes a little getting used to but can is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
i will have to see if i agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the computer direct processing and shipping was fast outrageously	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is not known	0

the price was the lowest i d seen in my entire life and i lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
sound crystal clear and the is very deep as well	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i onscreen displays	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1

through runs wire the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
the quality and base is amazing	1
on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
it does tend to run quite hot and plenty should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
the keypad is size decent a but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
the router failed today due completely dead rrb when i need to work from home lrb to heavy snow	0
this did nt bother me too much because is still a decent size	1
one last note i would recommend buying this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
i spent hours on that and i to nt connect could the internet	0
sound quality is good and is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
ring tones only with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
i ve it used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the replacement was a bit worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
i a while ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in is too but everyone elses daylight	0
i of them ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
not it would since work as advertised i called support	0
nice machines but would say i consider their quality pretty low now	0
when the player it working was was great but	0
seriously i love it	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
after using it for just watching a month i could not play any dvd	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery is not a real problem the company and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
parking was free valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
door code broke after a month	0
would nt buy of because again the customer service	0
the build quality is the team top notch	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be nice but i dont think the price of the unit will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
this little speaker has the best dynamite sound	1
this at this price has worked flawlessly for me and player you can t go wrong	1
one phone is this of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
the next step up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
the functionality on this camera is	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
what it does perfectly	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
print allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or it server	1

it is not it	1
my life is pretty good	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1

conclusion i was ready to pay i to return the speakers the day the shipping got them	0
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod how mp is	1
the price performance is just right	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
we received this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion is that this machine will be very useful to a lot of people	1
i just set it up manually which is very on my computer easy	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
so far i harddrive based and i quality this to anyone who wants recommend over appearance also anyone who wants a have no complaints mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love someone so much	1
other than that the crisp is so sound and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
the sound is surprising lots of detail full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
but anyway what i think you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the pictures are so amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
transfer a windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it nomad you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to through windows explorer folder for the allows	1
positive reviews are generally positive	1
navigation could be better can there is nt really anything the zen xtra but t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
mp x optical easy takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all is the above mp cameras zoom to understand and use a lot of features but add on options comes with great software and last and by far not least received my fiance of stamp of approval	1
upon opening these i found them to be really good quality really small but having a solid feel to them	1
all i can say is that can say this is an excellent devise	1
many of our movies are missing or disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and other high quality digital players	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you want to listen to some good music rather than heavy metal no problem	1
i cant believe the size and weight of this little critter	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player working either not connected or busy	0
focusing on a display rack of orange away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures a shade by this camera were blurry and in produced about feet	0
all and all very happy and i am extremely pleased with this camera	1

you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
it does nt smell bad but it does like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
however since i am in an office i normally them keep at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
the damage the memory is staggering	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size looking around for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixe camera i initially gravitated packed to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1

the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have a little more complicated gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0

even better with the optional headset you over listen to music can the integrated radio	1
overall i like the unit	1
the combination make of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are the screen does not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size the only issues i have are minor the feel and layout of the remote control ar only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s not feel like a real remote control the screen does not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through ever with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0

it the best bang is the most bang for the buck out there	1
very happy with the happy monitor and the price	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone is a great phone and i think will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1

while the ease of use was good very impressive i was put off paid on by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1

the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
i was dissapointed that the e mail address was nt more helpful	0
you can not get mid range or bass lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how tweak the levels	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
i m not very happy with this but i cant do anything or acer	0
screen grab was good easy to read	1

player this is an ideal purchase	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit bother you your pocket and not in	1
to me looks very cool and seems quite small it and very light	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the to listen to the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my music apex is actually ruining my media	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness viewing angles	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for very useful these cameras	0
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is and easy to use in music transfer controls are wheel is really easy t easy to play after masterin perfect for the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is and easy to use in music transfer controls are wheel is really easy t easy to play after masterin perfect fas fast as hell in music transfer controls are wheel is really easy t easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size what range than the you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better is expected rrb	1
second the automatic save feature on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
i m glad canon has been able to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
it is very solidly dense and has a nice built feel to it	1
however if speed reliability and power to to connect to the internet transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
your health is fine	1
the function lever which one the switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and i have ever used	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully the speakers through the jukebox	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just not very helpful worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
i am extremely glad i bought this camera	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was slow but now its still really fast	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size or bag it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
i spend hours day a vnc session the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
even is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
i d tell you myself my was going to tell you myself my experiences but the battery died while i was waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try thi experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it should straight out of the box	0
love this feature simply i	1
what day a junk	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good user experience	0
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
lots of sound options has made it an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
the quality of the screen is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
despite and sound quality most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
am very proud of i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i a receive did message that there was driver installing the a problem	0
best tech support have i ever experienced	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
range of functions as indicated it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those are serious about photography	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the router was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
i this connected to my late macbook pro and it	1
the screen goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
you ca that upgrade nt is irreversible	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate modify can existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
creative are the sound people for computers can i t understand why eax would introduce static	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a is better hard drive based player	1
price along with i considered when the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times zooms gets you just that much closer	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i will to to drop them convert look forward to august when i am and our other family phones from at t delighted t mobile	0
but it work so well now that i do nt anticipate problems with it	1
they are not wowable good	0
all in all is another excellent creative product this	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd worked and none players	0
i have sent my ad back to the dvd store because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful you have little children around and you can always take with you and take many pictures of them	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
the router failed today lrb is not able to connect to rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
the has the radio function which is used for	0
it so but big value mac	1
problem the player sometimes freezes not a very big also but can also be annoying	0
i just sort of nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack did fizzled out	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be and i tend a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
there are limitations to what you can do with it because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
could be better but there nt really the zen xtra t once ve gotten comfortable with it	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused it to occasionally not turn on	0
the sound is a creative product as one would suspect from excellent	1
i around played ve with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors a lot of and very light weight	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but hold it that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
i am quite happy with the results	1
the player hangs up on file management every once in a while prompting a reset	0
i think real the reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal buying it for that s not what you are since	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you and will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
it does have nt firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
do you want to buy this monitor	0
the upgrading while memory the keyboard connector broke	0
got a system error problem about a week after purchase	0
after nearly pictures i pictures have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
this monitor love i	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
in menu to scroll very convenient etc	1
well the theory went awry was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
this company has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
is the battery life is amazing	1
i tried to play the song with three times no success	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on as they stage and are truly portable are the best jbls i have ever used they have the same sound quality as the jbl on as they stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i lov lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
however you do get what you for in reliable products	1
never will i buy a creative product again	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
light but it is not ideal for low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low traffi it does not have an auto focus assist light which lighting situations is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
transfers edit are surprisingly quick through usb	1
they look fantastic	1
the switch negotiated and just fine the speed presented the router with a gige link	1
i tried no apex cust service called help	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
well the theory was but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
kept called apex is support number numerous times but it just i ringing	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast music the and continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
the door would not close	0
good luck	1
very fast usb makes for having transfers	1
for a price that is still less than what i was able to find on the market and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
i needed the battery to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
large found it very useful for transferring i files to another computer	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
mac is so small but big value it	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i have used this app on my phone for a few months and have had no problems	1

own we two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased for the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell with here on amazon	1
to send it i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
never am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would i recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
everything now it still plays so you just can t see it	0
second the touch screen navigation system and controls are poorly designed	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
for the price and quality of this product i could not ask for more	1
i m not one uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
the sound is excellent fact battery life is excellent the price that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the the cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
bought the gb version of this book a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
it is enough to so small but big value mac	1
also feature to automatically put in is nt always	0
lots of options and it has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
it do a fun little gadget is nt expect high definition sound	0
i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
the plan is okayed	1
as i mentioned before the new mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said and though not perfect it may still work better	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is small oh is unbelievably there and it so light	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the player has the option to play the game which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
it think this is i is biggest flaw	0

the design and construction are excellent ergonomics of the nikon optics as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1

the camera has of wonderful set a features	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually have the ability to pick up a signal	1

it has very good range much better than the linksys router and is a lot it replaced	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
i big volume knob love the remote controller stand with it is especially and simple selector buttons	1
and really this is the best phone one	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
avoid this model one like the plague	0
i have a problem with this mp player	1
the light on auto correction is awesome	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone met and surpassed my needs	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos detail that challenges all of the mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on comes with last but by far not least fiance is stamp of approval	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone saving features and point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
the usb port on the back is a very nice feature	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
i chose g because of reputation for very high quality clean images	1

with this mp player you get much more memory can get for much less than an ipod	1
it had a casing heavier and more sturdy	0
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for matter occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
the only minor nits i have with is a bit it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it the camera are slow between shots	0
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
it a perfectly for about worked week then the problems came	1
it works better on g band than the linksys	1
i think biggest is it is this flaw	0

this is an ideal purchase	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
please a firmware upgrade that all the usb drives enables attached to this wireless router to be seen in the desktop networked local computer actual portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1

be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
and it works great too	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1

the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there it takes a is no delay between songs	1
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
yes very good the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
it would spin read spin read read read and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we this router for our two computers	0

it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain but will play them episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
well it had good power but no precision at i thought all	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
customer service kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
on the up side the phone has a good battery life	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
it took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1

nikon out there feel is the best camera i for the features and price	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
it would just spin up stop and display no disc	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the are going to cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from image quality from a technical camera a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i fully expect it to go on sale again in some form or fashion or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
both and very easy to learn use are intuitive enough for even a novice	1
otherwise this player is is awesome	1
surprisingly everything seems work well	1
am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i	1
player this is a good dvd for the most part	1
nice and all	1

but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex player i love it	1
it is lighter to carry around than a laptop and it has enough functionality to use	1
fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
however it has to failed deliver on quality	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0

all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
valet plus is free to use and was set up in about minutes	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you the before it begins its transfer	1

forget about the sleek of if it can t play some looks your real dvds	0
capacity	1
the monitor works very well and comes with a sharp and bright display	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
great sound battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i could have tried navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
for the cost of this service i could not ask for more	1
down it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of light	0

i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three and then died	0
the player hangs prompting on file transfer every once in a while up a reset	0

one good thing space is gb of disk it	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great camera that takes great pictures yet does not take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
and is flimsy feeling the remote awkward to use	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing this is not very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1

so far the router fine has worked well	1
also the lens cap is design is flawed	0

the top that covered the battery kept poping off without any warning and there was a bit of a touch near the bottom latch	0
this on my countertop is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains thing and also to listen to my old track records	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate are calling once the person you the speakerphone feature answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
as a portable player it should feel comfortable a bit more durable	0
unlike some of the other people who received a people lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
the first routers best worked good for years	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful and only review it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom not does pictures	1

full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
software is easy to use	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could back plate be inserted	1
this size small speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1

small size	1
first of all the player is sound quality superior is to the ipod	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume the sound is loud enough at	1
the colors and textures are great	1
the larger zoom is a must it lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual on the hard copy nor the cd version	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the xtra is not deficient in this matter	1

i was willing to live with the larger size but the the price durability was a big zero	0

the scene mode works not for the remainder of shots that are well going to be in a regular setting	1
when i st i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner that i had made the disc with	1
good the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for i experienced a flaw using eax	0

the same route or t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
it works great	1
pretty comfortable re they stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the camera so you dont have to worry about running down the battery but the charging system also enables you t smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
you have some good customization options the as well	1
update the finish i think is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the are your requirements house then this router will do the job	1
it this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
the best thing about this monitor is the stand	0
can also assign special rings and graphics to special people they call	1
this is a good deal users for music and data storage	1
solid resistant to scratches for heat better heat dissipation	1

music can is based on id and this organization be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0

so slow that it is not useable for files of any kind such as backups or back ups	0
its when im not on the road ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
this player inactive is an ideal purchase	1
ripping the songs off is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
the setup process for the nomad and the interface with the player is sub par	0
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
i bought this slick phone and i love it	1
they deliver great sound when up and actually receiving a signal	1
not a bad monitor for but it is not the best	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
these speakers are great	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this model device that it does nt know what to do	0
we got two phones for the t rex family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
the quality of the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0

this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1

without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd ive ever seen and the best that i ve seen	1
i the least all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in find	1

my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number of videos on dvds	0

the movie clips taken will always have a little bit of you some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
i wo the go into the details here as the online sites but into great depth in their reviews go i am very the with the features nt speed the picture quality pleased flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
my only gripe about the is the buttons	0
issues like other reviewers installation was hell	0
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal went out	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
i have nt had a chance to really push this player to the max but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
seems like a good product	1
simply the canon eos d mark ii is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and i think that might be a problem	0
working for hours with totally on shuffle it rocks	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with the results of this forecaster	1

what nt do i like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not too hard to use or horrible	1
the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
whether you re taking a brisk walk waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you did	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very happy with this day forecaster	1
sure it is a little bigger than the others but not by much	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually push the button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0

others in fact say not bright enough	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1

it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being of problems afflicted by a number of glitches	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the where was to reset it and my computer far too often in order reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
of course i ve hesitant given the price but i was been extremely impressed since receiving one and bought a second it as a christmas present for my parents	1
the design is sleek and the screen has good resolution	1
they had a great time and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
this phone is great as a whole and similar features is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
they could be more but in the department	1
the port on the back is a nice feature	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
it of equipped with lot comes wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
sharp image	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m but i was able to figure out most of just messing around with it at a camera store	1
fragile	0
well it no precision good power but had at all	1
going through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that were in the box with it	0
also the lens cap is flawed	0
the manual mode is easy to use with fast the for shutter speed and aperture selection of access without having to fumble through menu options	1
the future is good	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can a good idea at the time not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
without ever any tweaking at all if the exposure is and the colors accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
the g had problems focusing a low light and would after take the picture when the shutter was pressed but not the shutter had been released in few seconds	0
quite working simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in the next few months it will cost me about half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1

the screen may be a little smaller but font it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0

the features nice i are really cool like the radio	1
the picture is clear bright sharp and the sound is good	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it very not access mls does well at all	0
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0

this product is not available	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
i do i but unforutnately like this phone overall am returning it	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
seriously that has everything this thing a pro or expert amateur could want	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are better	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
loved the slim design	1
i was surprised to find not only could this dvd player mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which created with smart ripper	1

way less expensive than the	1
very happy with the monitor and quality of the product the price	1
if you are not picky about image go for it	0
the speakers are nice no would expect from a speaker this size the question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might sound quality expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
i did nt read anything in the manual about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
i sent my monitor buzzing to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic in of random problem from my acer gd hz monitor	0
first impressions were loud and clear unlike with last year	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia phones that has made	1
oops easy to go and online adjust it there	1
the color and is red is so attractive	1
it would either not it would play it play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0

is not only it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
it the grain was terrible	0
i have to say that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1

life battery excellent hours beats ipod is	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill for such a small speaker system	1

shipping and they are very easy to set up	1
depressing the scroll button to continue	0

very set to easy up	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
no dead pixels mine on	1

the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
i love it	1
thing i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1

picture quality is excellent	1
no one rrb power adapter a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is sells	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however some users have complained that the scroll wheel itself is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked warranty but the replacement warranty will be worth it since i will only be using it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
frame freezes and the family yells dad with wrong somethings the dvd player come quick	0
it played only one out of three dvd is the other two being afflicted a number of glitches	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than adequate for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
this led to	1
it has a beautiful design features of lots very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
pretty good however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too the lrb computer i like to get done with some background music viola distracting audio is great for well this is relative great for a the work speaker rrb	1
and i am a big fan of jbl and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1

one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i would like	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to begin with	1
this phone has a lot of other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has playing mp s and it has difficulty trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
and looks really sleek and stylish it does everything it claims	1
it is it worth	1
those used to mm cameras will find and g very comfortable the friendly to use	1
the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0

canon is g	0
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
i guess that a lifetime warranty means it may take limited lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
the router has obviously problems been tampered with with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
am i bored with the silver look	0
both units are small with similarly small arms	1
the mount is easy to use it is to just velcro straps tie up on the handlebars	1
quality awesome sound system	1
the game program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just a few times	0
without a doubt the apex dvd player that ve seen	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just didnt work	0
in all d say this is a decent router for the money	1
it is easy to use and yet complex	1
can t beat carrying collection with me wherever i go	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
to very convenient scroll in menu etc	1
the other two played only one out of three dvd is without problems it being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
the interface of the creative software is not real intuitive	0
the sound the battery is excellent the that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the function lever the fragile which switches between capture and view mode feels one	0
this a list is an excellent value	1
fine little weighty but otherwise a	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work t mobile is services they deleted the menu options that would enable you to the to be used on a different network	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i can t get a video from the machine	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st paper was so thin that it broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
is the most bang for the buck out there	1
like it is predecessor in the quickly very revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the color screen plus a is as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
first of all the player is sound quality and the sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
i would but rated it five stars have for the poor manual	0
this thing is trash	0
months of use and it no works longer recognizes anything	0
they deliver when great sound hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
the sound is surprising full with a a amount of bass even for such fair small unit	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is enough the brightness of the screen bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
very i am overall satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
plusses quality ideal for use are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
tech apex literally nonexistent	0
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does come the	0

yes the distortion i dont know if that is what in the corner but i designed lmost exactl there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what in the corner but i designed lmost exactly ot the picture	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted contained i d tag on music the option to search for the player via in a folder is unavailable	0
we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
i ve been using the g using for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
at the end of the day what i a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity features easily meets those criteria	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do say that i do not enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs your phone on this thing	1
unfortunately i bought a new ps because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other speaker ive ever used best speakers i ve owned	1

i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras settings because i have never seen anything better within its resolution range	1
the g had problems had been released for a few seconds it would take a picture but after the shutter having been released a few secon focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed camera had problems had been released for a few seconds it would take a picture but after the shutter having been released a few secon focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed when the camera had bee but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
overall i lufton the unit	1
it may	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
replacement battery is compared ipod to is	1
it would spin read spin some more and up on the screen then show on the display that there was no disc	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad music site is fast and easy	1
is insanely fast usb transfer	1
than my previous netbook with single processor	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or you having lunch at the park just ll be glad you had the fm radio	1

screen good easy to read	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker with great bass and highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still plenty of light	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and will come back on it works the next day	0
forget about the the game sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
now heres the stuff you should starting with the things the screen is really big and the blue light in back is perfect fast as hell in controls are to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
oh and screen saver feature pretty sweet	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the app the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the software is very easy to some use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking the bass to spend on computer speakers	0
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
navigating through is super easy especially if you have owned a previous nokia phone	1
contrary to what you may have read elsewhere the g does sync at of a certain point with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
i could this was a cheap monitor as i set it up	0
price per gigabyte of storage	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
the controls on the player are very intuitive there is no need for a manual	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to the ability to external flash and lense filters choices	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and there a standard mm headset jack	0
the problems came later	0
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
the canon software for raw images does not provide you with any information at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the software	0
looks like a very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
it has never worked	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective and easy to use and is linked to a good cddb service	1
this is to wonderful have for your first dvd player	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
even the slightest of the things you do totally distorts your image	0
lots of flaws but exceptional make sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks the gaps that remain	1
has many other features ir just to name one the features above view as the most beneficial	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
i think that the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the system has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
works great	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
after was poor one of the disks was finally recognized but video multilple tries and features not available	0
sound quality may be off is good	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
i ve minecraft playing and on it been multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
yes there what you see in is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way into the corner and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what you are seein what to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what you are seein what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
i use this a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit works with it it worked well when i set it the radio on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
no control i really have no complaints over this unit	1
i this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned the app before	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as soon i set it up	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music called unknown be potentially placed in a folder to	0
i got my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
the computer used for data processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g who is serious about digital photography	1
we got this on time and it was brand new conclusion that this machine will b perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine for the price specifications keep in mind i price and the m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the g has the battery is charging so yo a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while system on the g in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down th be charged while system on the g in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
it is lighter to carry around and easy to use it has enough functionality to use	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great battery which advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
this really is a great little phone got nice features great ergonomics and its tiny	1
overall i have i like the system features and performance	1
scroll button switch	0
in any case navigation i is ok however by artist album miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
so far the router far i think has worked well	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually sound pretty good	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable easy to use	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
this router her work is phenomenal	1
ports having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
back exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone	0
was counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer not pretty painless	1
the to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
you can see the lens barrel the view finder	0
i chose the g because canon eos d mark ii of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
i love extremely low bass and as such i suplemented the a sweet jbl sub	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud crack on yoursound quality the sound might depends	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is work with my iphone	0
would i while like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
the controls are much to the simple ipod ones	0
but low a with price comes lower quality	0
navigation is easy and i found that copying and pasting files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time do i but nt mind buying notmad	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give perfect pictures right out of the box	1
i got this for christmas and a is it great gift	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car a lot even with freeway noise	1
chic look and good comes the player build in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
up wpa with no problems	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air air circulation	0
it and lots of little cute features my favorite being the games has the pim and the radio	1
the internal network still functioned but it not pass the internet signal from the cable modem	0
this is a great camera for you	1
well this apex dvd player turned great	1
sound quality is good	1
for those of us that like to tinker i hope this helps	1
so sit back relax and brag to your friends who paid a mountain for dvd player that can t half the things this one and for a fraction of the price	1
higher but with a low price comes lower quality	0
the controls on the player are very simple for a manual	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
audio is the quality excellent	1
there is no way the amount of water battery supplied lasts hours	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home network with a cable modem as input	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
the zen stores all its files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or to be deleted the zen does allow programs to be launched from its disk	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you sound looking for is a good are in a small package	1
other than that thing	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have game and then you need a to get the link cable to get additional games	0
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to overall anyone wanting a high good quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
no dead pixels on mine	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than can see what u see in the pictures	1
conclusion items i bought on i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my car i have it in toyota camry mode	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
in fact it caused my system hang more times not so i uninstalled it stuck with mediasource	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
the service from t mobile sound quality is very good too	1
without a doubt i would say that be have the as the same sound quality jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can these speakers played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would get from a true line out jack	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly no backlight and there is no way to change this	0
the larger lens makes it easier to zoom in gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
i the controls like aperture priority have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature and aperture priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
all nice and compact	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i was so happy i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
bright visible screen	1
in model that the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
the quality is excellent	1
what a disappointment	0
it worked from to it at which time the picture failed completely	0
the zoom is nice	1
without having to go would be far better through the isp and taking all the extra steps through the netgear genie tool	0
the with the iphone earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
this is one of the nicest ve devices that i electronic ever owned	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand very helpful	1
the controls are much the simple ipod ones to inferior	0
i ve used the speakerphone for two hours and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
as well of metering options excellent range	1
another nice both in that the unit has thing optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned is the literature i d scanned before buying	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to be careful not to push too much in or it sticks	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate would get you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line about half out jack	0
i am very pleased with it so far	1
this is my second creative music player and it is definitely a fine product	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
it also does minus have voice activated dialing big nt	0
ring tones only come with crazy one ring that sounds close to a regular ringwith all the ringtones with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one round that sounds similar to a normal rin songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
honestly this player	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
i find it too bright	0
the world that this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
any the g delivers what must be considered a best image quality of overall current megapixel digicams from the detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really is what i think love it	1
what a day	0
it on the ground is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this pleasantly baby runs	1
super works easy	1
and amazon also has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in mp a camera	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than i expected but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not find them to be that difficult i dont think it would justify the huge difference in price	0
in addition it comes with the following	1
do item nt buy this monitor	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix have it for me if necessary	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
many of our disney movies play well do nt play on this dvd player	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
with mediasource being so easy i found the for no use bundled nomad explorer software	0
but this one is great	1
clear is crystal sound and the bass is very deep as well	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
this dvd play basicly is junk	0
i thought it just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching it	1
i could tell this a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
it would have been a lot nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level this on phone is especially quiet	0
good worked the first routers for years	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to judge it based on the fact that its in a different class	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
please feel free to contact their customer service	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt not anticipate any problems with it	1
i did not managed to know how make creative nomad explorer to work	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life of the world nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to very well for me my network easisly	1
the design excellent construction are and as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
this phone is great qualities a whole and is not like others with one or two good as	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
awkward to use is flimsy feeling and the remote	0
this program was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
portable	1
for those who want small speaker for a medium the thump that this is small speaker but for a large capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
this camera is closest than any other digicam that megapixel	1
i was looking for a phone for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any problems	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
stick with it nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is very portable and can be easily worked without taking your car off the road	1
i am happy with this product the price was very reasonable	1
not seem to one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
it comes as a free app with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
also sometimes the player freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
one downside though is that autofocus does battery work well when not is low	0
i bought this monitor a couple months ago and i have very satisfied with it so far	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade a good nights sleep and perform well forever thereafter	1
however a phone call to the customer service crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
the hair is so soft you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
do nt buy this player	0
it is a great phone travel companion if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
value comparing data storage options	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
the cool screen quality is excellent the unit looks sound is bright and the replaceable battery to read and easy means a major advantage over the ipod	1
at first i still with this as mbps was dealt really fast	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and all play great	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was for me as a visual artist and i discovered accident that it will mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i can hear it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
image sharp	1
please consider of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to just plain does nt load on some computers	0
do nt buy this monitor	0
the screen is large and easily read	1
unfortunately it turned out to be the disposable type	0
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd or the last stopping a particular point in a movie every movie or time we played it a few issues such as not recognizing a dvd or the last time we played it not being able to play a particular point in a movie every movie or time we worked on it or no not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use the bundled nomad explorer software	0
despite this minor disappointment i slight highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
like it is predecessor system quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight categorizes relatively intuitive navigational the that a based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to this monstrosity get to fit in its cage	0
well this speaker the does same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i love being in this thing	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
so is great the volume range you can blast it if you want	1
is crap software the software	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday car out for rides	1
p fantastic little computer does a lot more than i had hoped for work study travel	1
not only is it choice more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
it worked never has	0
the ability to connect to the router is a nice when backing up from my various computers	1
highly recommend this monitor as it is hard to beat at this price point	1
this machine will change your life and your idea of what a laptop should be	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good different variations can get you with it	1
they say	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i do can with it	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the bottom	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the zoom goes up of the way most settings in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter and down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at down	0
i tried this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to progam and auto yet its be creative exposure settings bother excellent photos if you do nt want to provide with the settings	1
however i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
my first impression was positive	1
sound quality is good	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in to replace the mbyte cf wit raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
meanwhile the instructions for offered indicated i should load contained a pdf of instructions cd rom but it turns out it only the and apple users nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
it is worth it	1
for the money the price it is a well spent investment	1
hopless product hopeless company and customer hopeless support	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again the no on which i can t create folders or at worst run turn out to be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products fro a very expensive tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from againmy gu lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
a call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without problem	1
price great	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna would be nice to have one but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
if you can afford it it is woth every penny	1
will some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
i called apex is support number numerous but it just kept ringing	0
i ve to e mails sent their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
after multilple tries video of the disks was finally recognized but one was poor and features not available	0
my only gripe about the battery life hardware is the buttons	0
besides i widescreen monitors hate	0
i treat the battery well and lasts a long time it has lasted	1
all the latest acer stuff is top	1
please a firmware upgrade that will allow all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer as well as in the web portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic get home when you open the drive	1
the unit i like overall	1

its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
i think it too bright	0
even full of jpgs cds viewed	1
player is mechanics are also	0
this phone is great as a whole and others not like is with one or two good qualities	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
software is another great misfortune hard to i have a hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt could go work with mp s the list goes on and o operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt could go work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
the router recognized my other wifi devices breeze easily and further setup was a breeze	1
this router does have the ability to reboot every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
my other gripe cheaper the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other is apex units	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power key on off is small and difficult to press	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
another point of note is that he is incredible	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
the sound quality is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you can see you own reflection on the screen	1
when i put it to use at is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
i can t it it one star only because when it does work rate is pretty good	0
then my dvds would stop playing in would just the middle or not even be read at all	0
for of speakers the sound out is unbelievable	1
we the frames the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter tried started to freeze for no reason	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate placement of the sub woofer and you cant hear the bass from the subwoofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0

the scroll bar is a travesty enough a pain said	0
its more difficult to select songs and has use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address ect like the ipod	0

the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and mouse does not work well	0
my other big complaint about this is the stand	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
this has that many capabilities so you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection i go and the zen xtra is of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1

i have had for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
also i have not had trouble reading any of the mp and vbr mp cds	1
would it either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0

my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax new imac feature	1

i would not be inclined to purchase an apex court seat again	0

thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1

the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but had a connection no internet connection	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
my friends were impressed with the the of quality pictures i took	1
x zoom is nice	1
avoid the plague model like this	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
also this player is a plus unlike my previous player	1
the zoom goes up and down in makes it difficult to see what you are looking at at mos magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way screen is very small and the way it moves up and down in makes it difficult to see what you are looking at at all the screen does have magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size abou down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound and no picture with a cd it worked fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
price	1

the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses but it also addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0

other then that it is a fantastic display for the money	1
like other reviewers said it was hell	0
does what it should and me sound seems fine to the	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping the cash down half a grand for an ipod	1
to mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps the tie up on the handlebars	1
easy to how pair	1
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
even it you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your is is new even when it is nt and force you to tell when that your computer computer authorized	0
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
i tried to play a couple of the song three times with no success	0
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes a long time	1
as a non technical person i was able to figure out how to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
product is definitely worth the purchase	1
some features in the user interface	0
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like an alarm clock and a stopwatch	1
i do nt of care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing always id tags	1
i love this player and would probably go creative labs with again	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
loading cds was a little more effort somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
this dvd play is full of junk	0
this for the price over is a good unit	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus a visual artist me disk for and i that by accident discovered it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data as without vcd formatting	1

i find apex the ad to be a great buy	1
when the player was working it was great but	0

i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt answer my question about certain disney and other dvd movies	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations in my opinion	0
i have excellent speakers on my phone hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
food the price is very good	1
and it holds sooooo much a number of music and audio files	1
other tagging problems to be solved from the nomad is operating system	0
technical support was slow and unhelpful	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and marks for an unbeatable price	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time mp charge it uploads to s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i think gpu hardware acceleration that made the changes is that it now uses the real reason	1
first my impression was positive	1
very good are also the rate plans at least for me	1
for fact that it can be used me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
quality very bad	0
it does of the users do nt generally use firewire cards themselve nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support and finally they said lrb you get your computer back right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
when i finally made it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass so if you wanted that you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
on the keys poor visibility	0
i ve been using the g for over a year now and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
the reception very good and sound quality are top notch	1
its reputation chose the g because of i for very high quality clean images	1
overall rating	1
there are limitations to what of can do with frequency adjustments because you the built in speaker crossovers	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative account	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled software explorer nomad	0
excellent battery life hours beats battery life	1
but anyway is so cheap the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
online music services to longer battery life greater accessibility and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom select city forecasts working properly making it impossible to was among nt in my area	0
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer players and jvc players	1
last night needed to reset the router i	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created vbr and mp cds	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
the buttons on the phone are a bit big even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
however it has failed deliver to deliver on quality	0
there for the price is nothing better	1
you can be up to about feet away it it and from will still work perfectly	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
in fact i would say not bright enough	0
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
here is a pic of the phone the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
excellent sound quality and base is amazing	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can eax would introduce static	0
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
the more i work i the more with it love it	1
this is by far the finest camera its price and category in i have ever used	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
for instance i made plays of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it several back ups the dvds	1
computer do nt want to be a sensationalist but this i is incredible	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player so i think that might have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and a also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need good bass huge subwoofer	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has worked so well for me during the time i have been watching it	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have access to them as they evolve	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
progressive a player for scan relatively low price	1
it was good easy to read	1
well on keypad	1
experimented i with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations minutes under was	1
is small	1
my ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after and perform well forever thereafter	1
this was product wonderful easy to unbox and install	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be easily adjusted	1
the software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset the router far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection id like to see some of the latest bandwidth management software	0
it does not have an auto focus assist feature but it does have auto focus which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low traffic	0
the best features are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
but i already emailed creative tech support it they fix for me if necessary	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob remote control and simple selector buttons	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
performs well but love having the optional scene modes they are and correspond to many situations in which i would actually to use the camera	1
nt play a lot of discs	0
this thing is great to music i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
the catch with the canon g at the moment is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
after about an hour it starts skipping in slow motion like the dvd is are dirty	0
but about of dvd movie will start again and the picture kicks back in after skipping a fe is i ve played on ithave movie on my dvd the picture will freeze but the dvd back still play a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd back still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
so far i have no problems with the sound quality and i would recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who is looking for a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which and simplest of the one is easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
height there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
took me a few tries to get to the navigation but is a very user friendly player imo	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
user replaceable battery	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
ve had it for about weeks it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
you can do other different things it with such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
in addition it comes with comes a sleek and powerful headset	1
this is a very light phone a little less oz than with long battery life	1
first the app then the app zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
i have been disappointed find out that there is no manual for this device and no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missin to find that there is deal no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
both the black black speakers and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the remote for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so	1
the player hangs the phone up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is when i used it in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of the box	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the storage space is great	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it the floor on its side	0
to lot of has mentioned about	1

when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the i thought they objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1

it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
mid range is nt the best but it range is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not the best out looking to spend on computer speakers	0

this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
ll be very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front of the hous i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1

it in size is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1

the auto setting does not work a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1

bass fanatics will be at the s pii	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think this is a good idea and offers some advantages	1
