the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1

this product amazing is	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway traffic	1
i love these machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0

however of the latest software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too order to reclaim	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1

so no problems easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
the zen xtra s great with good headphone and well recored mp sounds	1
this camera has on to find out more just log a cool stitch pictures feature to canon is website	1
my other gripe is the remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
they claim to respond but in fact in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the other features	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt work	0
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is might this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
i ve been g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that is advertised	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
again the sounds and were spot on projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
the only minor nits i have with and camera are it it it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap the is fairly boxy looking is a bit slow between shots	0
hooked to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
these speakers are great	1
very i am overall satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
but this camera great is	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0

the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
great bag i guess but the price was right	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for is however many have complained that the wheel me cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
the replacement even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
despite this minor the canon g i highly recommend disappointment anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made	1
i will never forget	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work as well when battery is low	0

also navigating while playing music is a lot more intuitive unlike my previous player	1

the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
mediasource is an application the following features with serious user interface flaws	0
well this my does the same wonders for speaker low end ht setup	1

the storage capacity is great	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
this at this price has worked flawlessly for me and player you can t go wrong	1
what day a junk	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the quality of the product when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal the sound was good but i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes sound a little	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
a metal face plate and good build the player comes in a compact form with chic look	1
as could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon i i set it up	0
the size is a little bit bigger a little than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
only one once about the speakerphone you can only the person you are calling the speakerphone feature complaint activate answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre easy editing of id tags but it allows listings	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user replace the battery him herself by the lid and popping in the new battery	1
or maybe so netgear screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
i remain extremely pleased with	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install my car the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
speakerphone in my car the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the flowers are beautiful	1
unit worked great for a while then video output failed	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files player the from to the computer was easy too	1

operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
the that came with it did nt fit very	0
but for what do use i it is perfect	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
i got this thing for christmas i have been very with it ever since	1
excellent sound i found music the reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
the labeling of the product itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0

video output stopped	0
this really is a great little its its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and phone tiny	1

sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles are which is a nice feature when you as a radio bored	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
you crank a little to a a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones to other speakers or or external receivers	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected just keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion is probably not the best when it comes to a lot of people	1
but it work so well now that i do nt anticipate problems with it	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but left just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection i go and the zen xtra is of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i bought and a half ago my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0

i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn	1
i keep e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0

nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it have also tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was but i ve never had much luck with it and it is not something i ve been trying t on top of a portable radio but was but i ve never had much luck awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
i m with this product	1
the light auto correction is on	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
the camera has a number of features	1
while of would like to give it stars instead i i gave it a because i has run well for me during the time it have owned it	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion the in viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and way it that engineered to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
this is a list a great camera for you	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
it was really easy to set up out of all and i got rrb my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones the box connected to the internet in minutes	1

ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
the more i work on it with it the more i love it	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased especially the performance of the these compact speakers with at the low price on sell for here these amazon	1
i have no complaints with you	1

the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the instructions that come do nt explain how to make things simple	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
creative are the sound people for eax and i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
its annoying when you and it does work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
when tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn work either	0
it really impressed me are with the disign the specs the price	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
however since i am in an office normally i keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
equipment included is not included in the price but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily much say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
for i still think its a great phone	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in my house and i trigue i can use them on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
i love my great nomad its new	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums from my library onto this unit	1
and as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced features for those who are serious about photography	1
this camera was affordable very easy to use and produces spectacular images	1
m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and i have open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or the sound is much more acceptable	0
after multilple tries was finally recognized but video was poor and	0
bottom line is for the these price things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
files audio is excellent	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
this phone has a very cool important and useful feature the speakerphone	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1

one good thing about it is gb of disk space	1
i tried to play three times with no success	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but is always display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen interferes with viewing at most settings	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
silverish color really adds to it	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
speed showed that the speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is that comes big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the range is great and im either at home or in a basement four bars all the time	1
very easy to set up	1
i am very happy with this phone and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will on this cause you to miss precious shots	0
ever camera best from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
it will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
gb rocks my socks spills my beer does nt wash my car	1
but when we went to picture there was sound but no use it again	0
which can be used to track stocks it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this a plugin device via their software	1
protective case completely is useless as is since it obscures display window	0
i wo nt go into here as the online sites go into in their reviews but i am very pleased with features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and functional conveniences this camera offers	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
i purchased bought this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them because the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
sound quality is good	1
i love the storage in fact that im this thing	1
best electronic i ve played since i was born	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total change in him and this is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do is job	0
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the plan appearance is okayed	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
i purchased three these of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
i find it too bright	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
when the screen was contracting nt or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
main dial is not backlit	0
i t	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
the best thing about this monitor is the stand	0
then easy the files is sorting as pie	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the user interface is great	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
connect to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
been able to get ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i oh have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel it	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
no need to firewire to the camera	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two most important factors on why i picked the nomad	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
well it had good power but not much no precision at all	1
is not very deep and the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
it never actually timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot it times in one hour lrb that i takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which reboot lrb i have n does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
those used to mm cameras will find this camera to be very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i m with these happy very i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
but i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
excellent polyphonic ringing tones very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
numerous has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and the router other programs	0
my life battery life is ok	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the zennx will of running for the price keep a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a just lot of noise	0
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
his voice is very exceptable	1
people also have about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
what face added in functionality detracts in build quality as the is plate is prone to popping off	0
i wished that they would have been able to make the volumn a little bit louder	0
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy great camera it is	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1

fine	1
this phone is great as a whole and is like others with one or two good qualities	1
a lot of a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
this fun was very prompt standard shipping service	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
i have my even used not new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
i am using jbl n ii as surround sound for this review which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
i m sure it would and can be low be useful in a different setting one where you would sure only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the resolution is very good and the colors bright and even changeable are	1
can t beat carrying cd collection everywhere with me wherever i go	1
i try navigating using the player is built in and it still nt work	0
and aperture i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls yet are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1

great price for all the features	1
the price performance looked just right	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
n the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0

the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
very prompt standard shipping service	1
it is light to carry around all day without bother	1
my house is small to it is hard so judge the real strenght of perfectly through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked the product in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
you can stop looking this n the best is router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i computer did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
it would light just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous error page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
i enthusiastically recommend this book	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is to use	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded carnegie hall	1
i ve been proven months now using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
the problem is large	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
i have nt had time satisfactory really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are to as should be expected from creative labs	1
i have ice me and it keeps telling age no disc	0
the volume range is great so want to you can blast it if you want	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0

despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i have i have to must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped a little surprised the box	1
is small	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
sound quality is good	1

excellent available range of metering options as well	1
is amazing the battery life	1
multiple play modes tracks order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to we had to manually the on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
this is one of the electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1

the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1

with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1

headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
easy to set up it has life a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
i think real the reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
point makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these digicams and shoot what at f	1
as well also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the new netgear and connect it process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
the canon g is out there the best mp camera perhaps	1
this is probably can of the few dvd players at that one play almost everything you throw at it	1

i did nt want one in which i would have and put in is a pain myself lrb that batteries rrb i did alot of research these read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased to speakers	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i ncercat am quite happy with the camera	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work fine	1
i am very pleased with match product and the price to this and have nt had any problems	1

forget about the sleek looks if it can t be done with some of your real dvds	0
the sound is awesome but if u yoursound quality it too loud depends on put the sound might crack	1
it did also been around seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0

in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that could just be my imagination or it could have been just the batteries that came with it	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can be very loud in a small house for such a small speaker system	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition can as performance be expected for the of specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot machine people	1

the zen stores all files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be run	0
recently bought this along a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m pixel fine combos and many the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you see pictures immediately	1
second gripe in the the monitor is that some or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
proven canon built quality and lens	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
the speakerphone the speakerphone and all features work perfectly	1

i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player one of the best on the market	1

for the it is a well spent investment	1
is mediasource an application with serious user interface flaws	0
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well quite as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1

longer battery life greater accessibility social media and music services and pc compatibility are the main goals to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1

the grain was terrible	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
it is invisible and dissapears in your pocket	1
also it also has unproven battery life	0
this is that samsung one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
overall i like it	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
but if great you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1

easy to use a lot has mentioned about this	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote not show the complete filenames of to the main screen mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back t control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of to the main screen mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
its ability to serve as a sort of back back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
this time d link support was more helpful guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
on the up side life the phone has amazing battery life	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
drop usb drives into the portal and please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer wireless desktop desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a great point and shoot camera in the mid to high end price range	1
over all experience which made us a fantastic very compact camera photography on a totally new level	1
on so dvds far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
awkward to use is flimsy feeling and the remote	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
portable	1
sound for personal preference can be adjusted settings	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel pretty much useless or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0

the aff feature did a great job of allowing the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
the netbook work as a breeze for was my sales person worked it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
the a non technical person i was surprised to install as cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
both the black and the white very good speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
this camera is worth every penny i and highly recommend it	1
the pictures are fabulous and their a learning curve it there are tons features i have nt even gotten to	1

this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be compromised	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1

it wo nt play of a series of books which are all store boughten	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out all the things turn to be true in my case	1

the combination of the price storage size and player features make this player the best on the market	1

the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
only if we could find them	0

but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best one best out there	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture quality of the camera is mind blowing	1

brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
the buttons on the phone can get are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this from the car it saves me item lugging a cd case to work to the gym in since etc	1
looks like my esp w iphone docked	1
finally but playlists from the computer can be making because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed complicated are organized in alphabetical order	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
has a type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
for those be creative of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1

otherwise i think this player is awesome	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
the eax mode that keeps n song is a great feature that the volume at rides the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1

the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1

its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
however the creative software is not the interface of real intuitive	0
it is easy to use and easy for my grandmother to use	1

my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
this product does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
sound quality is very good and i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures and does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
the design is sleek and the color screen is good has good resolution	1
the screen is very easy does read so the blue light is bright but to read at night enough dim enough and it to nt blind you when you stare too long	1
phone great	1
did did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i i with my old front speakers	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on the deck	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
i love this player and am extremely happy happy with my decision	1
i placed all of the controls well find and not flimsy in the least	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0

overall a very good buy for the price	1
the nt was atrocious several elements simply did interface work at all	0
on fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd b my pentium pc with x drive	1
this company has been a nightmare to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share music with friends and family in an intimate setting	1
my only complaint is that the bluetooth is like crap and when i am not here it randomly disconnects from the blu bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
i am not to savy with a computer but i have found that it is very easy to install and set up	1

in short if you re just a person that is a little afraid of the internet and you just want a router to get online do you want to be able to surf and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is	1
this is the i phone best have seen	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots my first experience with this camera very disappointing	0
after and hearing sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
oh is the screen saver feature and pretty sweet	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
it is light enough to carry around also light all day without bother	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
system is very powerful	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
would recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a speaker system	1
this is one of the most beautiful books that i ve ever owned	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and this the photo quality is awesome	1
when it works its great to have but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
no games it has a big screen why not use it	0
it is also a bit more expensive than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution great battery life which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
it has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
with this mp player you get much less memory for much more than an ipod	1
overall a buy good for the price	1
the remote is flimsy feeling has no buttons and awkward to use	0
died getting after very shortly them	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the use as you have to go selection you want	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the zooming lever is a nice touch but i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
great color display for a large picture and just the right size for my desk	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
would nt buy again of the customer service	0
no connection direct firewire to the camera	0
in all d say this is a decent router for the money	1
operate is another great misfortune hard to software does frequently screwed my music library up crashes nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt never actually timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot it times in one hour lrb that i sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad nt sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot it times in one hour lrb that i soun as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
rude and unhelpful support technical	0

the sound quality is	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very brightness sharp clear	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and i think that might be a problem	0
reviews for positive are generally sound quality	1
possibly the advantage this has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
the backlight will periodically fail not turn on it did not the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the features eax noise pretty cool as well as creative has or a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous are encountered in a car included on a train	1
besides i lufton	0
i was able to take a few pictures of the th of july fire at the park and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
it and really sleek and stylish looks does everything it claims	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated all learn at to	1
there is no speaker grill to offer to the speaker any protection to the driver	0
i find this to be a great feature	1

the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
these speakers great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
chic look and with a sleek good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
the canon g is perhaps the best out there	1
main dial is not backlit	0
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
pc greater accessibility to online music services and longer battery life compatibility are the sensibilities	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i try to view them on my monitor	0
this new speaker has dynamite sound	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
pictures wo nt transfer using directly from the camera to pc the included transfer cable	0
the picturers are amazing	1
all in all this is a great product that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is easy to understand and use and a great sound	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
this phone is one of the few phones that have the iphone plus an fm radio tuner built in	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
they will not respond to my emails emails or texts and the phone line is constantly busy	0
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to the side to protect it against any damage	1
i will be able to use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and be the best they continue to impress for the price	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
i m it would and can be useful in a different setting where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have very been happy with it ever since	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i out but finally decided be and is i could nt on this one happier and i m convinced it now that i have it the best one researched many different mp players there	1
that is true	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped it would for work study travel	1
great camera quality	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
on the positive side is good once you have everything configured	1

there is also no height adjustability so it very low the desk	0
set up ssl wpa with no problems	1
on the up side the phone amazing battery life has	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
all in all suprisingly to easy use	1
its ability to serve as a sort of back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
the performer has been a steady apex for me	1
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
crystal international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces harmon clear sound with excellent clarity	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
i gave the zen stars because it is a good player for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in other classes	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the only problem that i found with the internet service is it does not access mls very well at all	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i used to have one and did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
it will play the entire read and play all cd audio disc	1

i would recommend this product to anyone	1
if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to work with you	0
experiences also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
i a player because the ps could nt play and now the player t play everything	0
i will have to see if i wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house either that one didn t work either	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume loud enough at	1
it is very solidly built and has a very solid and nice dense feel to it	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
i do be want to nt a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it was taken down due to poor reception	0
i have tried customer service times to seem a hold of apex who does nt get to answer their emails and telephone number is is as the one lonely many rep constantly busy probably extremely overworked	0

is excellent image quality the	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that can i trust	1
overall i had giving player stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i scroll only m the this for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or ve wheel problems show up with me too	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
i do nt always have time for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
set up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very doesnt work or just is nd very usefu useful	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
people in the area have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is very well insulated and offers very good protection	1
the adminstrative was great as long as you have an software user account	1
software definitely sucks on me hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
i do nt know but other people are saying what the software is awesome	1
even more viewed cds full of jpgs	1
operating its many features out i was but i m no annie lebovitz able to figure is easy and often obvious most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
the camera has of wonderful set a features	1
however the main reason i am will satisfied is this product with the fact that it not lock up at odd times	0
both are easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
creative labs customer support website is available here	0
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
for specific location i still think its a great phone	1
to error prone even that process was my amazement	0
for the is there price nothing better	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact d popping in a new battery the user can then charge that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in pping in the new the new battery	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a get price than what you can higher in the states	0
speakerphone loud and clear has like nice extra features some currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
folders can audio files not be created for the audio files	0
i have been using this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
this is one the nicest by far in so many ways	1
the environmental audio however and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0

typically the problem is it the headphone jack was for me and many others	0
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
it small light and nice looking and is decent as well	1
outdoor photos i took when with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1

transfers quick surprisingly are through usb	1
after months it has started playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
screen grab	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
i am very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the ringtones included the following songs and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
the only things found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone is too	0
a is a great piece speaker system for this computer and it is worth every penny	1
the pc sync feature and i love it is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
it has a good signal strength very light weight and is	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time up the sound quality is good to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
this means there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i was would worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
it is so mac but big value small	1
the acer monitor has from extremely bright screen rrb its design allows the placement in an area lrb an a heighth perspective and that many screens will not fit in	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
i got it today it works great great sound i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i recommend this tower	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
its ability to serve as a back up is for my music collection a huge plus	1
the battery which costs to replace user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is cheap	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the sounding	0
my wife is very pleased due to its widescreen	1
overall it is one of the best on the market	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly being on the phone replacing batteries	1
it all this and more worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has was	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1

the controls are my the side instead of when which i like because that is where on thumb is on the front i hold the thing	1

these speakers are just amazing	1
but within days the video output quit working	0

the text is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt get in your eyes or distract you when you stare too long	1
i found it very useful large files transferring for to another computer	1
do not have a zen account and if you genre tags do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
it is easy enough to you it open to see what song pop re listening to	1

its for it you pay annoying a router and when does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
no is there way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
for team with a good the most part this is a good dvd player	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped it	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
it does look nt pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
screen brightness is really good	1
first of best all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1

it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
works great	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
that addition it only seems to about five feet if you re work away from the player although that may have been just the batteries in came with it	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast easy to use but it is also eye candy	1
great sound very long rate life very fast recharges battery removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the display is large and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
best in class sound	1
the only things i have found that i have nt liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
because it can make a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1

i do nt want to be a sensationalist i think this but this computer is incredible	1
i find all of the controls to be useful not in the least	1
great but i d buy another	1
is flawed the lens cap design also	0
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
huge storage space i loaded and of music which is nt that much songs my entire collection still have gb out of the provided to you	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
for example are pretty cool as well in creative has included a number of eq adjustments that the eax features compensate for the extraneous noise encountered as a car or on a train	1
and run set up wpa with no problems	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0

technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i it love this phone	1
nice light phone little compact	1

the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to twice my vista pc at least reboot not fun	0
protective case completely useless as is as it obscures display window	0
was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to set the router at so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the about her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
the problem with this box is that several times an hour if not more frequently	0
this far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever	1
just an average user getting good product but you are value in this product	1

the top that covered the bottom of the door kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
they	1
the software has nt been all for me at a hassle	1
i think this the storage capacity is great for me	1
the canon software for raw images not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
a few things you can do the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
color the screen is good	1
storage	1
i been have ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1

this book phone is highly recommended otherwise	1

i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have never been so happy with it	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
other than that is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
have the player since xmass and love it	1
i guess that limited time on the warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranties	0
the replacement was even worse than the one original one which was now working fine	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
software the software crap is	0
this is an excellent player especially for features and features the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1

there is right which has been said in other reviews about the features of the it is a great phone mine worked without any problems much out of this phone box	1
the response the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
their network coverage is very sporadic the network always seems resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
vocals have greater as well with the ihome clarity	1
i have back to apex my ad sent because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
solve called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not i the problem	0
well was nice while it lasted it	1
wow really this speaker rocks	1
to would not be inclined i purchase an apex product again	0
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels get to to the selection you want	0
does not display player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is enabled	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
we tried enough but it did not work	0
but it seems to work so well seems now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
i have seen yet not any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1

as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0

the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip to the uk this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
well turned out great this apex dvd player	1
the subwoofer has terrific bass and gets really high	1
my other than the tv remote gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i have ever seen	1
nice little phone and very compact	1
loved the design	1
mode with auto manual and the very helpful scene the possibilities which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
due to the lack of features and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening is very difficult and the listening qualities are very poor	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three and then died	0
playlists can be the fly without aid and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playlists	1
and is much faster it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
nearly pictures i have found that nikon takes incredible pictures	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
the next day i turned on my and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the reviewer got me to buy was what that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
the cheap is replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod user battery which costs to replace	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying very nice for the return shipping	1
but if you re looking for my opinion on it go ahead i love it	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail available address is not valid	0
the hard drive i sometimes attached to the usb port was had accessible sometimes not	0
the system was near stable and the code was alpha stage at best	1
the ihome superior stereo reproduction is clearly is	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
an excellent feature for example are bookmarks but not on this player	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
the customer service is very rude	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
you have fast to scroll so to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
well flash of noise are never great and there was still a lot photos	0
i fell in love with this app because it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch work well and	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player for about more	1
tech support was very you and helpfull once pleasent actually got someone	1
i have had no problem at all what so ever with this product	1
the hardware about my only gripe is the buttons	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it the is best digital camera available under	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
it works during flawlessly installation of cx	1
of the size is small	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that only reason darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so it to work you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to progam and auto yet its be creative exposure settings bother excellent photos if you do nt want to provide with the settings	1
maybe it find the quality of my is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
i m not very happy with it	0
even viewed jpgs full of cds	1
this product worth definitely is the purchase	1
the only drawback is the speaker is not very deep and is very thin	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
one of the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
navigation could be better but is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable it	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but this was a big zero	0
this apex model will work not work with my universal remote control	0
you irreversible nt that upgrade is ca	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is than with standard speakers making it harder to hear	0
volume the	0
simply how this product was created and was left behind	0
range was to or possibly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
recent price drops have made value for money the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
i bought this set it up all and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you are packing it up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the only minor nits i have camera are it is fairly boxy looking it a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
in the hands of someone who idiot nt it will yield good results on does program auto mode	1
i played ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the sound is a creative product as one would suspect from excellent	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are little a dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the picture editing software it comes with is adequate but not very robust	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
but this one is great	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to get the speakers the day i got them	0
the build quality is excellent	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is a great tool to grow into	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
no dead pixels on mine	1
solid resistant scratches to better heat dissipation	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
guess what mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch before i used musicmatch to rip my cds but i bought the zen and creative	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
the customer support is very rude	0
however you do get what you pay for in it you get reliable products	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it would shut down and i could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc the only thing i could find	0
this phone is a joke	1
died getting after very shortly them	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
the second menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but in that this is because different less expensive not necessarily inferior technology is used	1
the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
this camera on in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
this is one of the most popular phones nokia has made	1
this software is absolutely terrible	0
picture in quality outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as these images clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
with the lack of a knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
my complaint only to date is that it dropped once security settings the and i am not sure why a malfunction nt know if it was something that i did or if it was do of the router	0
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem with it when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the movie will start again and the picture kicks back in after skipping a	0
you of course will also have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see modern or classical as the interface	1
ripping the usb cable out even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
i am delighted with this product	1
setup is simple and worked it right out of the box	1
i highly recommend it	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt respond but it may be just operator at times be a bit error	0
i bought this set it up and it works fine but i could not connect at wireless n speeds	0
very system intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i pleased extremely m with it	1
the color screen is a feature of the phone plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
i love this like player	1
i m easily best possible pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the enlarging setting as yet	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has been amazing	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
setup software for i application my found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
the replacable battery is great since once it runs out or wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
the is alot better than most the phones out there	1
on are indoor shots with a flash average not quite as good as mm	0
i like the nomad is color better is not terribly flashy it but	1
but i would definately recommend it	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the volume was turned down or that it was resting on my desk	0
i t find it too bright	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally your image distorts	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a i think a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
made call successfully which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
and is a tad boomy and s sounds o w the subwoofer it still l unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
then sorting the data is easy as pie	1
it would spin spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
i need this monitor	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
it may	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in comparison to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
i can recommend it to anyone anytime	1
even leaving it on produces crystal clear playback	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible and sometimes not	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
to keep it a this is cheaper and in my opinion short better choice than an ipod	1
cons i think whole thing will the satellites look ugly	0
the screen is always on and ring tones are unlimited	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to your old phone to this phone me hours of re entering	1
i bought this monitor a couple months ago and i have very satisfied with it so far	1
were both good	1
the woofer is much larger	1
the first one we installed did nt work work at all and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
the that is so good sound my boyfriend wants one now	1
night first the does got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself i nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
bag mixed i guess but the price was right	1
the speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which when are bored	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on player kept going	0
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
the problem that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
finally making downloading and playing the playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by genre except for the tracks which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical orde playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
yes the features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
the problem with this box it that is reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
people do nt know what other i are saying but the software is awesome	1
it is clear crystal clear	1
this router is the best router i have used to date	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this still doesnt work	0
its fine	1
there it an alarm i still have nt used is yet but it should be good	1
great price to use for all the features	1
bottom line i my home than have a better set of speakers in and i can use them the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
megapixels is for anybody and the photo quality is	1
i do nt for the life of me see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with the excellent customer	1
billy joel was nt kidding when said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
i have it on had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
the speakerphone works i than any speakerphone better ve ever had	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great value for money and mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does not work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
it was already there and we just plugged it in	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
i think this is another excellent creative product	1
very good range in a good place and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds put in it	0
having usb so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the phone has a on the camera few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected the phone this phone to do	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
i simply love this feature	1
in hard model the that drive just died one morning before my class	0
quite simply the firmware and or the os that ready for prime time this thing is not control	0
the about my favorite thing nomad is the eax feature	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this not to the zen it applies to all the company products	0
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
the sound that from that little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
frame freezes and the family at me to make yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
the black leather steering fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
in features some the user interface	0
all in all bad device bad for the price and customer service run like hell from this product	0
it was already there and we just plugged it in	1
the is okayed appearance	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
the price of theese speakers the sound out	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in box my older philips machine	1
the design and construction are excellent is legendary	1
it played without one out of three dvd is only problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
the me its perfect and for quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
hooked it worked like a charm and very light weight	1
are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected	1
this machine will change your whole idea a what of laptop should be	1
the key is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing music and the sound quality is excellent and the picture and sound is top notch	1
life battery good	1
anywhere can adjust the volume to be heard you or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a good size	1
positive the on side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb in photoshop with mb raw image rrb lrb i do a lot of work in photosh with m b raw image in image clarity when using files and noticed the difference immediately rr raw image in image clarity when using files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
the quality the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
excellent picture quality pioneer par with my on panasonic and jvc players	1
i ordered it on from monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago a the time i got home by work tuesday	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
would definatley a friend to recommend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the monitor works very well and comes with a sharp and bright display	1
easy i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i work study travel hoped for had	1
instead	0
upon first looking at these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
it may has never worked	0
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both are great were bad	0
i want nt do to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
i loved the look of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
lightweight also very light and portable	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
the memory is staggering	1
this did nt bother me is still a decent size because it too much	1
is the sound quality very exceptable	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
easy to read	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
however shareport on this new router worked fine	0
a list this is extemely lame	0
its silver finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it i have had no problems with the phone	1
my blu ray player and my live action dvd box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
am a new user we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a ebay a few months ago and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a new in lo new in lot of people	1
this is a good deal for music and data users	1
i am able to carry concealed close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily it	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
another nice thing is that it has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before i bought it	1
despite the things fact that this is the most expensive item that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it middle of the day saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
on my main computer the software did not work at all right	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i the buttons the top hold the thing	1
i bought this phone for my trip to the south of africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
it different small overall bigger than the ipod but used in mind that this is because is less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is keep in the zx	1
the phone book is excellent and the speakerphone is very user friendly	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations minutes under was	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
because other people that complain about player are bull this is awesome it just breaks which is horrible	1
material is on the cheap side	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it would be better if it came with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
only can vouch for the quality but owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and control	1
good battery life	1
i m not one who uses am web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
ripping your songs and selling them online creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
quickly on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather the buttons	0
player works and looks great if is very easy to use you can get the dvd is to play	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
even after reading some of the instructions even it is still hard to figure out	0
the sound is nice and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
the mechanically lever is shaky i hope it does not operate zooming otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
amazon was wonderful about picking up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and a little bit of everything this product delivers both	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
the pictures are absolutely so amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
a winner phone is this	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for thing i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyt processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the machine very is light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
easy enough to navigate through although i prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
with mediasource being app so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time something to work	0
the market it is the best camera on overall	1
the file lcd screen was very large and readable	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play some of the episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
i m sure it certain level would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
it also was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it could nt be happier and i convinced it is the best one out there	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
you of course have some good price options with the unit as well	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to you can be a genius downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
is very good the price	1
nice machines but i quality pretty low now	0
also you can store data on it which is for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
it plays just about any video that i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
to simple very use	1
i ve been trying to find a way to get by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers like some advantages	1
do nt buy this player	0
i was surprised to find that not on top of each other only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me one dvd player was able to play the same dvd not only did this dvd players play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dv to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
the router connected to all my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router get going again then	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time to load and then concludes no disc	0
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for focus feature point and shoot	1
in addition it only you that work if seems re about five feet away from the player although to may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
exasperated it am i called at quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
with the poor design continues third the case	0
surprisingly everything seems it to work well	1
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
great product my perfectly for works office	1
the sound is excellent one would suspect from a creative product	1
know how to program in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1

as it stands now the case is pretty much useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
kind of bulky and the can deal with that is awkward but i wheel	0
my only complaint about the hardware is the buttons	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery screen nice life resolution uses windows which what is the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
the door would not close	0

i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
it has great battery life fm radio with excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1

you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0

i am extremely pleased with this router	1
best camera from ever the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
very well and i was able to use it in all rooms and corners wit my house is small so it is hard my house to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product product worke worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1

i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
here made out of metal and is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1

it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
many of our disney movies do play on this dvd player nt	0
the woofer is much larger	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that range and you need a good horizontal there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0

the system and the code was in alpha stage	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support calls	1

it has never worked	0
for the price of a few dollars the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
the picture is perfect although i m not dont know why im watching on an hdtv	1

this is an excellent value	1
while had the phone were good sound and an phone and earpiece	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
it does to it but it does come nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you of a high end car but it will break want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a huge plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play all of my jpeg files on a hard drive as well as cd r data	1

this camera is great	1
it came back working and i was turn in that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt momentarily out to be true glad my case	1

this is a list	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player in my opinion was the software	0
the image quality is excellent	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was fast outrageously	1
the screen daylight bright easy to see in the is with nice colors	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to at my vista pc reboot least twice not fun	0

the interface software itself which should was anything but easy to use	0
then and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had lyrics to the songs but i used the the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
the big backlight makes things easier to read and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was can hear can hear already out on the street	1

zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1

i use this with a home theater system and it is how the picture clarity is unmatched	1
however speed reliability and power to transmit a signal the house are your requirements this router do the job	1

the pc sync feature is superb that one of the features comes with nokia pc suite software	1
takes place	1
i think apex best the is dvd player you can get for the price	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
mp x optical easy takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all is the above mp cameras zoom to understand and use a lot of features but add on options comes with great software and last and by far not least received my fiance of stamp of approval	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad of the times when there are quieter talkers on the other end too quiet at line	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end the wrong button up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
i d tell you waiting my experiences but the router go to myself back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
it worked from to at which time the picture completely failed	0

at ounces it is a little bit light but not as light as the ipod	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet had a connection connection	0
i recommend it highly	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search great deal on a with the nikon	1
i m not very happy with this but i cant do anything or acer	0

fact that i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
and works great too it	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
the next day i turned on my computer and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
for the first few weeks this player was a disappointment as i expected it to be an affordable multi format player but it is a great player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
excellent is the image quality	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never less dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
i will never use all the whistles and bells and whistles this machine is capable of	1
going re you to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
for on the player are very simple no need the controls a manual	1
despite the things that i not be happier have listed so far i could live with this item since it having to carry saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
anyway this player is really cool and i really love it	1
folders can not be created by default	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good in the long run results on idiot program auto mode	1
very easy the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
things are much more distinct and i read nt when to strain my eyes and squint have something am trying to do i on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
thanks to amazon is amazing my policy i was able to return the product at no loss on return part	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the fact that it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other apps i ve had	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are and the lens itself	0
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
highly	1
fragile	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific point and shoot	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought is was good but the onkyo sound it amazing	1
if you are then go not picky about image quality go for it	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this speakerphone because of the small size phone option plan calling great priced and access to my corporate email	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
unlike the other people of some who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
same story as everybody else when trying service get to from apex nothing	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
quite simply the firmware frankly i think and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i tried calling times the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a very good card a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
i was willing to live a big zero the larger size but the durability was with	0
i use of for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job it	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen the problems people but as i ve had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems up with me too	1
d link does not provide mac support but for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble products with other sound blaster working which is very dumb	0
in short if you get online just someone that is do afraid of technology and you just want a router to re a little basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
great quality picture and features	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
the software mediasource can i not work on my pc	0
i think i like the unit	1
does what it should and the fine seems sound to me	1
happy m not very i with this machine or acer	0
fine worked	1
at the very least more sturdier a protective carrying case would be nice	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
the quality is superb	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t beat it	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the plus this makes for a great product	1
price gb of oil	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image considered to be quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response in terms of image quality point of view	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
it worked from to at which time the whole thing failed completely	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i was ready	0
i love the quality of the pictures	1
the service was exceptional the supplier from	1
headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
for instance i several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and and it plays the dvds	1
and it much sooooo holds music and audio files	1
without a doubt i would have to say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly the best i have ever heard lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
they have a whole range of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no extra cost on my part	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
poor visibility on the road the keys	0
it works flawlessly during cx of installation	1
i agree with the earlier agree reviewer angle and you need to adjust the brightness who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing and the camera captures the minutest of details	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get can get a lot more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
i had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
the pictures and videos standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
it is made wood of plastic	0
my jpeg view them on my monitor are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i pictures	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0

the final insult is that company have router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you this to while the trial software from the internet then pay to to some unknown download an additional unlock all the features	1
they re pretty comfortable stay and deliver a decent quality	1
the keys are a bit too close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular keyboards and keypads but it is not too weird	0
i fully expect to go bad in the same or some way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0

creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
the sound well and there is no complaints about that	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can a very easy to use ap instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly need to worry about that the ability to delete pics or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0

the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
bar on the right the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
is fantastic this led monitor	1
although the phone nokia is a little short on the features department it is honest an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the dvd player is is fine	1
slow to download and run certain programs all the best wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0

i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt think i will have any problems with it	1
return policy so overall it is a decent deal also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
the sound is surprising to say the least with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the dvd player is does not work properly	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0

the problem with zen is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products its a shame	0
and would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is i the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
for the price and features is really good	1

it played only of the games in the series and one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
it has a usb port so you can in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you a previous model nokia phone owned have	1

i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
card pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
through the menus navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the interface software itself was should be user friendly which anything but easy to use	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1

when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
picture quality great and features	1
i have no complaints at all	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the ks which are not listed but are listed tracks are listed individually and are organized by alphabetical order can be difficult because the cd which are listed separately and are ordered by the kd individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
this is a very a little less than oz phone light with long battery life	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no need for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
and man i had to work songs to put my chinese songs on the player favorite chinese because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0

you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock suck	0
fully going for a cellphone i was while determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
very range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by r herself by simply removing the battery opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
it may came well packaged	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me up	1
when the player was working it was great	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack which is what it was for me and many others	0
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
update jan the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
mine dead pixels on no	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
love this player i	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1

by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings just right i was able to get some really excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
the only downside is the remote very long line which requires a line of sight	0
this phone highly recommended is otherwise	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
thuumbs to acer ultra slim monitor	1
what a junk	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
the rendering is large enough and the text sharp is display enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
they do look cool as hell though	0
when but we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
the other day when i was will to a song it locked up and listening not do anything now	0
photos excellent takes	1
i got two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
but low a with price comes lower quality	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is it awesome just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to mb s has been around it even when in the same room	0
the changing colors help to tell the time with a quick glance	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any kind such as backups or back ups	0
granted i have only used this dvd player that find it up for my mom for christmas but for about hours was long enough for me to setting problems with this dvd player	0
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
with this mp player you get much more memory much less for than an ipod	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when to going the menu	0
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery size nice firmware updates and great price	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
the company offers a range of metering options as well	1
the customer support rude very is	0
this player is not worth any price and money i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
a scroll button switch	0
many of our disney movies are missing or do nt play on this dvd player	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
is it worth it	1
a small hole runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
t is which does on work along several long stretches not that same route	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo mind blowing is capture	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
customer service ability and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
it is great to be able to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
also it has unproven battery life	0
everything was great until started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
i can see between in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than can see what u see in the pictures	1
good speed and range speed	1
it is tall so i ended a bit heavy up laying it on its side	0
but i think it is perfect	1
ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port is great a little while ago it really and the picture was awesome	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive and a portable music based player	1
navigation but there is nt really anything can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
great viewing angles wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got for them unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know about	1
i have to say that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
it worked great and we pluged it in	1
repeatedly software failed the	0
for the price price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
is literally nonexistent from apex tech support	0
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
people on the forum have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm a great camera phone and earpiece	1
quality the is superb	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
this model router has now failed me the in twice short span of time mentioned	0
oh and saver the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
the did nt work corectly from the start the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
i just set is up manually which it very easy	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life lower price i found both	1
i try navigating using the player is built menu and it still would nt work	0
the catch with the you g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause canon to miss precious shots	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras lots of add on options comes with great software and last but by far easy to use has easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far easy to use has a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received m not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1

another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though this was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with it	1
you can also assign a special number to special people when they call	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter at the top of the screen that is about of the way down from the top screen that interferes wit of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
i tried e mailing apex back they come and saying undeliverable	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless terrible and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are imposing not and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
t is which does at all on not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
this phone is is a winner	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
the zennx will keep running for the rest of your life without the need of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w still it and sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned is but it all the way down all right because these are computer speakers	0
this phone feature a very cool and useful has the speakerphone	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1

only if we could get one camera in it	0
notch the build quality is top notch	1
for the price of unbelievable the sound that comes out is theese speakers	1
only one of the dvd players works so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
one other plus is that napster now supports device via their software	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i a returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
or if you stop the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
well this is a great player turned out great	1

ipod x battery life hours beats ipod is	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
bookmarks for example an are excellent feature but not on this player	0
when talking to people it the voice is not very clear	0
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor user support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the game	0
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone has already come loose	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
screen grab was good easy to read	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what needed	1
not spent the time i counting editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
i treat the battery a long life well and it has lasted	1
i ve had this for months now and i not happy am pleased with my decision	1
this player is not worth any money and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
but canon never fails to ceases amaze	1
my only complaint significant is sound quality	0
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light the controls like aperture priority metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and very easy to use the manual is relatively clear	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
so the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her home working from home from bringing work home with her	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone for looking a that digital camera good takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i love the storage in this thing	1
ripping your should songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base doesnt work properly and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
the speaker phone is very functional and use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
the battery is nice	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further testing of the router was a breeze	1
all in all this a great player blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features that is simple to understand and use and great sound	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and very careful as i was used to winxp using the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it an mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting use the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was fine	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device you	1
my wife is even more pleased due even to its widescreen	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up have the ability to pick up and actually receiving a signal	1
bookmarks for your browser are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
this app is a replacement for your desktop	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom zoom are a little blurry	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
solar power goes full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
the replacement top of the screen unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt front of the working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being very difficult to play and plagued afflicted by a number of glitches	0
sound quality is wonderful i like the smart volume sound normalization	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw dvd l rw and dvd w rw	1
the build quality feels discs it does nt shake and whine while playing solid or the picture and sound is top notch	1
the only two minor issues i only other have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
months of use no longer it and recognizes anything	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice very bright and colors	1
speakerphone clear and loud has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
there are limitations to what you can do with noise cancellation in the frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
image	1
the digital zoom does not take as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
anyways back to the point i was trying to make i have tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with the company and their terrible service and support	0
however once same with the other speakers but the sound quality is great lrb well thi you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola bit the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
excellent also has it coverage through our two story house	1
the slim design loved	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company seems to be the case is products	0
the phone book is very user friendly and the customer service is excellent	1
since it would not work as advertised i called it quits	0
well within days the video output was working	0
oops easy to adjust it there and go online	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should have been on the screen of the tv	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when listen bed to itself just to i to my favorite music station and the handset went does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
the level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound system	1
known as its focusing system is also very flexible	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
paid more than what amazon for currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb expected and to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it is me	0
overall the g has what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
and so far i have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
these speakers are great	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over located three story house lrb is unit my on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still a bit hard to figure out	0

this product is not available at any price	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu not let me and it would nt do it	0

unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable kind	0
nice little car very light compact	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor very good overall the game was rated to fair	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks the gaps that remain	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for	1
i ve now for a week had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
it most bang for the buck out there	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
and amazon com has it for less than how can you go wrong	1
a little weighty but good	0
it plays basically every media i ve ever bought so far even an old vcd that i ve never seen before and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
you can see the top of the barrel in the view finder	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
a hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0

i m happy quite happy with my new speaker bar	1

it came back working i was momentarily glad that the d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be in my case	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone got my new phone i ever had	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
delivery prompt was	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
to headphone jack seems the be a major problem	0
quite simply the firmware or and the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
for a well spent investment it is the price	1
sound exceptional though i it t really compare can to the ipod	1
the fm radio app is cool	1
i to anyone recommend this product would	1
my is thing about the nomad favorite the eax feature	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
portable	1
i will never buy a product from this creative product again	0
you can not the bass to drop get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
use have found that i interface on the nomad is very easy to the if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1

nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got the kids shots some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
back exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
first of all my calls and loud were clear unlike with sprint	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options i have been given such as aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just instead your regular pair use	1
i ve also had the nomad zen guy show up several times	0
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
the toggle button that is to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i wanted the to work soo bad it just did nt	0
get to chapter and everything freezes	0
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
i gave it only stars due to the to it being so small it fact that the st out of due one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very happy with this day forecaster	1
it looked just right	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
this product price is hard to beat at any price	1
i have had mine for a month now and to i enjoyed it	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock at odd times	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but is the price for state of the art	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got disconnected	0
only if we could fit more than one camera in it	0
however for a budget i is this camera think an excellent choice	1
the functionality on this camera mind blowing	1
this product is amazing	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
have had the player for over a year xmass and love it	1
propietary no headset jack	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does have a few quirks	1
i am impressed with use this camera is to how easy	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality of the screen and the placement of the buttons on the thing	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you it should be able to swap it out	0
it of versatile and seems to be one is the best	1
was was dissapointed that acer i nt more helpful	0

i love love the fact that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
my gut tells me the nomad in the long run be at best a gb portable drive albeit on i can t create folders or at worst in companies never to buy products from	0
the brightness is really good	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight or brightness of the screen you can choose different type of display either list or tabbed	1
i ve had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
has unproven battery life also it	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has grow that more serious is will love so it photographers an excellent camera to features into	1
but if you ve used a slr very camera the controls are mm intuitive	1
i will have this site to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
canon is g	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be nice but i dont think the price of the unit will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
it does not have an auto focus assist feature which is nice for taking photos in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in light but it is not as good as the sony	0
had it a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
its reputation chose the g because of i for very high quality clean images	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price use about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
i was surprised how good the sound and i especially like to use it when i am listening to books	1
battery life is ok	1
screen bright visible	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion car mode to my toyota camry mode	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the sound is amazing	1
technical support rude theyre and unhelpful	0
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy s program to install and set up	1

the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
the only i have found i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses	0
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of other eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or example can be used to on a train	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1

the software very easy to use is and was minutes of opening my box i within out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
this is great	1

the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has a great screen and has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
the size is small	1
player the has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
i have nt had a chance to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
camera to the no direct firewire	0
what makes the lack of resolution and lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
you ca not really go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
is very well integrated with this which you will enjoy	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
i did not get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
pros so i went to get a faster router and one did the job i bought it	1
i wake up and everything freezes	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a great camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1

when i saw a lot of places where there was metal i was concerned that the music would not be as good	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
silverish color really adds a nice touch	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1

the second lasted about two weeks before the video first one went out	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this likes to do a lot of phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
another point of note the battery is	1

i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
i think it is the best camera on the market	1
the woofer is a	1
this is by far one of my favorites the nicest one in so many ways	1
this time d link support was helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1

the included earpiece is very comfortable and very comfortable easy to use	1
because this camera sucks	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on how to use it for the first time	0
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and shuffle only for your now playing songs you can also create your own playlists or playlists	1
what day a disappointment	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually you out wears will be able to buy another easily	1
on my main computer the work software did not work right	0

chic look and good build the player in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility am satisfied with of it	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best one out there	1
looks esp w iphone docked	1
i m now capable of enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even having to use the best possible setting as yet	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i would but rated it five stars have for the poor manual	0
however its x optical is for of the shots that i take	1
the software software is crap	0
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1

here is the the synopsis brief phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the first one we installed did work and our kids devastated to say the least	0

it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
i have stored around cd is on this not even and have barely touched the available memory	1

it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
to the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have also open display up to see the it	0

the allows the usb interface on it router to be used either for nas or print server	1
also i have had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1

bottom line i than to better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least a my ears rrb for less have half the cost	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the final insult is that while this router comes useful software to make sharing wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
it does it only have difficulty playing jpegs not even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1

i tried these speakers and found them to preform well but they are still below expectations for this price	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
no sound effects or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0

the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
because it can help a so so photographer get the most spectacular photos	1
i d venture because say that to of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and of dealing with horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible user experience is great the apps and the quality of the features is great	1
they are not wowable good	0
ve i had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
when i st tried able i had made the disc with my it had no problem playing the found dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to that surprise was it to play cheep media get i had burned that i could nt that to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i more expensive	1
there are limitations noise cancellation in the to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will easily break not like typical american phones	1
the canon g gives you a lot tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it average person very easy for the novice to use	1
i just bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
also you can nt is which data on it a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do store bother this is a much better buy	1

all other buttons pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or set up in the first place or just is nd very usefu just is nt very useful	0
they re pretty comfortable stay in the room and deliver a decent audio quality	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
amazons new customer support website is useless	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i where because that is like my thumb is the i hold when thing	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
great camera great investment	1
depends sound is awesome but if u put it too loud the on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1

you can do so much more with the jme suite i mean you can get free ringtones from midi files free graphics from jme and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
for a specific location i still dont know	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
and stands are not and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
i t rate one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
and is enough for anybody megapixels the photo quality is awesome	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if time keep trying something it will work when it did not we one work before	0
i just apex is support number numerous times but it called kept ringing	0
the design of the phone is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek good looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your media your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
i did nt think i would find this quality so easy to use but and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
my two main requirements longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
its focusing system is flexible very also	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one ely customer service rep i think the one rep is probably extremely ove lonely customer service a hold of them and the one person who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworke rep is probably extremely overworked	0
this was an player before the video output no longer worked	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is not very good	0
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
thing anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
user battery replaceable	1
less way expensive than the ipod	1
selected looked because it it easy to install	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
lrb lost internet to the internet rrb lost internet access connection with the router internet service internet was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
first my impression was positive	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics send your to special people when they call	1
instead	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the i thought they objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
the woofer is much larger	1
this has that many capabilities so you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
were the monitors both good	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the shot when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
however a phone call to the d support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
full spectrum sound is back to great highs	1
they deliver great sound when up and actually receiving a signal	1
fine	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
it a heavier and more sturdy	0
are all very easy to use	1
battery ok is life	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus a visual artist me disk for and i that by accident discovered it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data as without vcd formatting	1
despite a lot smaller its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
the replacable battery is great once it eventually wears out you will be to buy another easily	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound quality on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
phone for the first time i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size what range than the you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better is expected rrb	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly no backlight and there is no way to change this	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
my one issue with the software that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
the apex has been a steady performer for a turning point me	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
unfortunately after loading all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
is the manual easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
to are clears and perfect they be used along with a sub	1
the reception and sound quality of the speakers quality are top notch	1
it does of the users do nt generally use firewire cards themselve nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
unfortunately be able to play the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
weaknesses are minor is a bit awkward the zoom settings are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting befor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to the screen is a bit small and the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through ever normal size	0
i also liked the fact that you the progress can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
the failed router today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
this dvd play basicly is junk	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i its my new nomad love great	1
you ll be changing in this cd track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
great minds price	1
i do nt think and really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to that a little while ago the standard vga port the picture was awesome	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big for people to see	1
it would spin more and then show that there was no disc	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the is not covered by covers the bottom of the case but the player cover has not case been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the cas bottom that releases the player cover has not case been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
i have it for a now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
this digital camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
after we discovered the problems not listed on their website and they are we tried to contact apex answer our calls and we have to call thei but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
deficiencies with zennx are easy to overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
i to reset the ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
definitely more capable of filling the room i think it s with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online recommend that you follow at the router the first thing i did is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
i tell everyone but love amazon and i hate apex	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing editing of id tags	1
very long lasting battery life	1
awesome sound system	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that and fortunately for me i owned a of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz	1
the phone is as good excels as a cell phone thank god	1
make it super easy	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix response that it for me if necessary	1
battery life the most important feature to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
at first the time i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it	1
looks like a very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
if you are not picky about image quality go it	0
stopped workin video output	0
without having to go through all the trouble of going through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
great works	1
while ease the of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
the sounds intended as the movie directors were	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
it would skip not play the song at all or either wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
price	1
the fm radio station	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has worked so well for me during the time i have been watching it	1
even the bass good even is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
their network coverage is very poor and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
wire runs through the body of the stand a small hole giving it a very clean look	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually it working on the lcd screen	1
they are very sturdy well balanced and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
the in program i d tag editing is a strong point as well	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
however it does not play windows media and not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
the world	0
player has a problem dvd dual layer with is such as alias season and season	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have in that should tell you if am the bass is great	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1

the creative labs zen xtra has all going features the i pod this and if you get if from amazon your only the to pay for has great player	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is quick a review	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity unmatched	1
it came well packaged	1
the storage capacity me great for is	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone buzzing sound and a strange coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to a number of different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal out of it	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
please consider this much superior piece before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the controls on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when hold the	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
this is my first digital camera and is a toy what a toy it is	1
same story as last time when trying to get service from apex court	0

the color screen is as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the this of quality speaker	0

this model router has now failed me the system twice in the short span of time mentioned	0

very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
unfortunately and would destroy them the player would not read any of my region one dvds who did this did even though they were not damaged in any way	0

good range speed	1
flash photos are never great and there was still lot of noise	0
all in all bad device and i would bad customer service run like hell from this product	0

nice machines but i consider quality low now	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had the first one to be returned	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able buy another easily to	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip is a nice touch are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
but this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
it also costs a lot less than the other options	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will to this one as soon as possible	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i have i can say almost everything	1

well the theory was great but the guest network enabling upon things stopped working	0

my house is so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
in size and design system is terrific the imo looking better than the ipods	1
door the story broke after a month	0
while there are flaws with the machine stars gets five the xtra because of its affordability	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive and expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made purchase	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
without a doubt i don t care at all if the exposure is low or high the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
the unit very easy to use and works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music player on the computer	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at brightness minimum brightness brightness for at night rrb	1
the changing tell help to colors with a quick glance	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
the only problem is it could nt be easier to use	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and is very good and commands are very responsive	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided my email me were able to help through the process without a problem	1
just it this camera two days ago and already love the features received has	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
the auto setting does most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1

it	1
i this thing the storage in love	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
battery life the drawback this is to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
you ca nt see anything wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
only thing missing is a cd burner	0

pros huge storage capacity for the and cons good value price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1

i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already	0
the text on the screen was very large and readable	1
in the opinion of someone who does nt it will yield good results on the computer it will program auto mode	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
having unfilled i d tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder with a name that is called unknown	0
great product works perfectly great for my office	1
the battery	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone excellent	1
you of course have some unit customization options with the good as well	1
one other issue is to nokia the headphone jack is unique that so standard headphones will not work	0
the data it over the network storage is rather slow but i only use backups for occasional rate so it does nt bother me too much	0
price gb of storage	1
it is a fantastic camera a great value and well worth the price	1
i only have one complaint and mb is the that card included	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly phone creation it as the new ipod not playlist mention such does nt sinc with contact lists to numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
the phone is light and very attractive	1
when it works its fine two of them but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to product match and have nt had any problems	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with makes well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening is very difficult and the listening qualities are very poor	0

the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
the color screen is also available a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they am not a fan of the auto focus modes are dummy proof where and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1

good speed range	1
i easy not to savy with a computer but the d link is very am to install and set up	1
is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
holds it and sooooo much music and audio files	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound as the on stage and are truly portable lrb can played without power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
anyways back to the point i to tried ve be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera before and know how to use the the controls are very intuitive	1
great features	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
b it takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar great and they both delivered retailers results	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
the set up is more efficient and offers a superior result	1
i around played ve with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
i m still very frustrated with some the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i open up my sound card is control panel every time i between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
speed means fast data transfers	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if because of something that i did or if they do that i dont know if its because it was something tha they do that i dont know if it was something that i did or if it is a malfunction of the system of the route it was a malfunction of the system of the router	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1

a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from and stronger time to time growing more frequent each day	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
selected it is because it looked easy to install	1
it is easy enough to use for beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1

because of it is hidden i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it a little bit	0

m i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
p it so not lite on weight is sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the level of interest in the level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a lot better than the standard band eq	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
with it enabled anytime we made the to changes router we had manually to press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
awesome sound system	1
even is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp they as s stream directly from the xtra	1
it surpasses the performance my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to tried to use it i had work from home due to heavy snow	0

i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seems to be the best i have seen in that category	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not i think by much	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for a small unit	1
i do i but unforutnately like this phone overall am returning it	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who to anyone is serious about digital photography	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the images are quite impressive	1
color screen is not available good	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be seem just operator error	0
to is closest this camera perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
i was worried that no noticeable difference megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player probably the best out there	1
the best thing about the hardware is the buttons	0
it a type is made of plastic	0
i was a the disappointed in little low end	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits low to the desk	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
otherwise awesome is this player	1
are great the colors and everything	1
the sound is excellent price is life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable battery excellent and finally the the cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
died very after getting them	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
with m quite happy i my new speaker bar	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
after years with that carrier expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
