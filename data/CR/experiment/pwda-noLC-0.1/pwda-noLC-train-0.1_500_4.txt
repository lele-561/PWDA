best camera ive ever used apart from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and expensive but the fact that they exist tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second or so just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
after camera a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size search camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
without a doubt this is the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
the sounds intended as the movie directors were	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
system has the software failed repeatedly	0
lots of flaws a exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it but good buy	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house whether it is large or small buisiness environmnets	1
one complaint the screen is too small	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to manual focus modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek very easy to use autofocus i love how easy it is to use the camer many situations in which i would actually seek very easy to use fool to proof and correspond to manual focus modes the auto focus perform well buti love have the optional scenes modes theyare dummy proofand correspond to manual focus modes the use the camera	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even they were not damaged in any way	0
if i were to rate these speakers on books based my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think judge they do the job that most people want them for	1
but hassle with this company nothing	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
one bad thing is that it is useless comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a small window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
great good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
second gripe in the or so months since we have been using these monitors is that our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
it all this and more worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has was	1
the headphone be a major problem seems to jack	0
is the device itself is pretty solid	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
it is small	1
the only thing i the quality longevity concerned about is m of the buttons on the thing	0
sucks the software	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
fortunately the g has an internal flash that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy in the world	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one app the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
it wo nt a list play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
this small size is very compact and speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1

this player is going to work fine with everything else	1
a week out of the box and i began to see from time to time growing frequent each day	0
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes hit minutes	0
has a major design flaw camera this	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either nas or print server	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the best in class sound	1

lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys modem instea modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item brand new dsldsl mode and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
seriously i it	1
it gives great pictures are easy to use the battery lasts the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1

next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
i gave the excellent stars because it is zen for the class that it is in rate it is not really appropriate to and it based on players in a different class	1
is bad software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it the not as pc side as some reviewers have indicated	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window button you could ac and if the so did nt cover up the see the screen jack	0
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it was a good deal	1
range of functions as indicated it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those are serious about photography	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts listen in an intimate setting	1
i expected the x digital zoom the images to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable to type on but it does take some getting used to	1
a little hard to understand is the remote	0
full spectrum sound great full base to from highs	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get can get a lot more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1

i do nt for see myself having in the coming year or two however if do i know that with this product it will be taken care for free and quick with and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
they sound really good just as the title would say	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty it means may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i finally gave up and stuck with mediasource	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good not the best in the world sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1

i give it a the following reasons rating of stars for looks	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1

for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail but challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot fiance features and add on options comes with great software and last not by far that least received my of is stamp of approval	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
it comes as a free app with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
at first i dealt with this as mbps was really fast	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that at play almost everything you throw can it	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button can be turned on and off this can be really helpful if shooting focus on focus on and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting focus on focus on a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
it is slightly lighter than the previous model and packed with even more features	1
the operation with the increased memory option was with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter and nobody mention this	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little over the top but this product really deserves five stars	1
i experimented with online print and e commerce with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1

easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1

great viewing angles wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
this is have ever used the best phone i have seen	1
i think apex is the dvd player you can get for the price	1
i think the made reason that real the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased cost in six months it will what half of except i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
the monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1

the price is right	1

simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price best camera out there today at this price point is the best digital camera out at toda point	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
even with these shortcomings i still think best is the it digital camera available under	1
on the up side has amazing battery life	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1

switch button scroll	0
i think this the storage capacity is great for me	1

it is small	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1

all in all it is very easy to use	1
they sound good really just as the reviews say	1
sound in class best	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening is very difficult and the listening qualities are very poor	0

it does not have an auto focus assist light which feature which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it taking low light shots it allows the camera to focus in low traffic situations it takes a lot of photos in low traffi allows th is nice for taking shots in low light situations it taking low light shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low traffi allows the camera to focus in low light	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to charge the camera while plugged in so you dont have to worry about	1

over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
its far more difficult to select and has easy to use on the fly creation as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc contact lists numbers address like the ipod	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for the price	1
so yes ugly with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and as	0
however the creative software is very not real intuitive	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers ve i owned	1
this is a very good two piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
but hassle with this company nothing	0

for a specific location i still dont know	1
i only have complaint and that is	0
usb network storage supposedly it is	0
this is a nice feature i e it is a bit early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening then heavy metal no problem	1
this is by far the best one in so many ways	1
the player is easy to use and outputs great sound quality	1
after had it a couple weeks it got into a state where could find the device no matter how often i my pc reset reloaded drivers etc etc is online support was no help at all	0
not sensitive enough at others is overly sensitive at times the scroll button	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there a lot of fun were more wap pages available	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me the software	0
it also has unproven battery life	0
and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
the station fm radio is cool	1
the netgear router was simple for set up and has worked well to the last couple to few months i have had it	1

amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying very nice for the return shipping	1
i how good he have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete list of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to the main menu	0
screen brightness is really good	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
you ll be changing in this cd track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot features and add on options comes with great software and last by far not least received my is stamp of approval	1
is staggering the memory	1
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
very good value for the money	1
the range is in the basement or in a basement four bars all the time	1
lots of flaws but exceptional build quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
i thought it was just the sound of the speakers but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is not working and it is ruining my media	0
also it has unproven battery life	0
the software	0
d link does not provide mac mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver link to a that is compatible	0
you can move the range to almost anywhere in the scene with the of button and it has an on manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
i have to say that i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
i think the real reason that made it changes is that the now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
so far i have no problems with the sound quality and i would recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who is looking for a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
some movies it played yesterday it playing today wo nt play today	0
life battery excellent hours beats ipod is	1
to my amazement even that process was possible	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
what i was hoping not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
proven canon and quality built lens	1
the sound is excellent fact battery life is excellent the price that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the the cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
also the lens different cap design is flawed	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera this app is to use	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard deficient all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not on in this matter	1
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
proof auto focus performs well they i love having the optional scene modes but are dummy the and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
they caused the problem ie duct in the first place and wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
the quality is really good	1
headphones suck i would like to invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mps mbps	0
again the sounds were turned on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
i do nt know what other people are doing with this but the software is awesome	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
exasperated at am i called it quits and be will sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the problem is that the anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the fastest speed same room	0
to camera was affordable very easy this learn and produces spectacular images	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex court seat again	0
so yes as with all software and as with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for focus feature point and shoot	1
these monitors great are for the price	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1

i have this connected to my pc and it works flawlessly	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still not seem to a decent size	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
with serious user interface flaws is an application mediasource	0
i d venture to say that it the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
only dvd it about two weeks so i expect we re at looking getting another progressive scan owned player of higher quality very soon	0
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
the small is size	1
is the remote a little hard to understand	0
player has dual problem with a layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
the screen has an extremely bright screen and its design allows for the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
this phone is great as a whole it has a lot of features and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
storage capacity	1
the memory is staggering	1
what is good in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the macro works great for medical photographs and the macro lens is terrific for point and shoot	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped good it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
failed the software repeatedly	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
is excellent picture quality	1
both units are small with similarly small arms	1
overall an phone excellent	1
died a week after getting them	0
to sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems the the base some the ac adapter of short circuit in be we can no longer use sort with the base or it turns off completely	0
best electronic i ve have ever bought since i was born	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well work as when battery is low	0
overall i am i highly recommend it very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the	1
i only thing the do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
only con i can think of is no camera	0
you see the lens barrel in	0
i got this for christmas and it is awesome	1
