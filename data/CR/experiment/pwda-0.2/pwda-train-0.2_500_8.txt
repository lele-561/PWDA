i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
the speakerphone the radio all features tv and work perfectly	1
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with far so not wrong digital pictures so hopeful i am very pleased	1
first of all the player is sound quality is not the best but it works to the ipod	1
the nice is battery	1
playlists can be made on the need to restart the game the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes playlists like shuffle and and repeat for songs you can also create your own playlists your now playing selections or playlists	1
the features are really nice i like the radio	1
the g had focusing in and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the had been released a few seconds	0
songs after loading unfortunately all i get now is player or not connected either busy	0
well i hope this does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
using in i them am my office and they generally sound good	1
i when turned good phone on the that hit me is how the first thing the screen is	0
when the player it was working was great but	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than the tv remote	0
it is worth it	1
my amazement even that process was error prone	0
this unit was working for the st month and a half and the signal	0
and sturdy it is very solidly built and and sturdy has a nice dense feel to it	1
the eax mode that keeps keeps the the eax i use this volume at the same level for at a set level any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
here the picturers are amazing	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
last night i needed to reset the router	0
on the back the usb port is a nice feature	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over ipod touchpad	1
if you re quality for a this tower speaker looking is it	1
it is easy enough grandmother my for to use	1
however when i plugged it into mac the screen mini my looked wonderful	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a gb of might just be the best buy out there for a gb of memory and the best thing you can buy for your mp playe large best thing you can memory mp player	1
would of the problem is dvd freeze repeatedly both during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
but then again the ringer can so loud that i heard ringing when was already out on	1
buttons doesnt work do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
the headphones are nt the most powerful but you can still expect much out of the small battery pack that you insert in the ear cavity	0
is nice	1
not modern day only is it the perfect size it is a great phone and also has all the features a high tech phone user end would want	1
speakerphone loud and clear such as a built in camera and has some nice extra features like features currency converter and a stopwatch	1
recieved this product time for a gift giving works good nice uses windows which is of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
i m not one works for me who uses a lot of apps web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it needs to do	1
not it plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
highly i recommend it	1
this camera also weight has a great balance of size feel and weight to it	1
love this player and am	1
the software be installed mediasource can not work on my pc	0
it is light enough to be able to walk carry around all day day long without bother	1
they say	1
i highly recommend a look	1
it is long way to get what you want it is use as you have to go a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and excellent fm earpiece	1
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
this very easily to two different android phones	1
sitting working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
i recently with the purchase and am extremely satisfied purchased the canon powershot g	1
even with these shortcomings i still it is under	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the player is mechanics	1
mediasource ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from but i musicmatch to my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
pictures wo nt transfer sd card to pc directly w from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
these speakers are great	1
the headphone jack is going to be a major problem	0
excellent sound i found the music music to be reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
am savy a computer but is very easy to install and set up	1
my first impression was positive	1
the color is red and is so beautiful attractive	1
its work forward and other models fast much more smoothly and consistently than those of rewind i ve had	1
the sound this slim design brings out	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and it by feel alone	1
the build quality feels solid it does good nt shake or whine not feel like it will while playing discs and the picture and sound sound is top notch	1
i love that it is free and it is so much more convenient for me	1
so it was useless and ugly as with all software bundled with it it was unusable	0
recommend a nokia	1
at ounces it is lighter than the mp pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
the software is very easy to use and within a couple of hours i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
bottom line i a better set of speakers in the creative labs trigue speakers my computer ears rrb for than half the cost	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
having spent my entire life with professional video gear i find this annoying	0
for instance i made a program to play close ups of my dvd movies on dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
honestly i love this player	1
both were the monitors good	1
i did nt read a thing about how just operate it it was to intuitive	0

this phone is good with a array of built into it	1
it looks good sounds good and does everything it claims	1

after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature phone with a high performance travel size i have finally found one i have gravitated towards because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
the hands is quite powerful speakerphone free	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
it looks great is loaded	1
after it to be a lot of fun and using it i found the playing with size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
be better designed used could the interface	0
