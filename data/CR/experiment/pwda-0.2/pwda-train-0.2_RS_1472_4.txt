another nice though is that the unit d both optical and coax scanned audio outputs was the latter thing not mentioned in the literature i has digital before buying	1
kbs even at huge storage space store can you a ton of songs on this thing	1
overall color g delivers point of be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance response the and what must view	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear close you can the subject and pictures with the lens unbelievably the take	1
this has happened when several different keep is and work if we dvd with something it will work trying it did not occasionally one time before	0
equipment included is average but are s nt big a deal since that is not what you that buying it for	1

transfers through surprisingly quick are usb	1
small size	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
what does it should and the sound fine seems to me	1

this a great camera for you is	1
overall like i the unit	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
weaknesses with normal of the remote control are only it so the feel and layout does nt show the complete filenames of mp s are minor really long names you before cycle through every zoom setting must getting back to so size	0
my overall experience was very poor with this monitor	0
the main problem the the xtra jukebox zen nomad gb is with software	0
is this an excellent value	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but do mind i nt buying notmad	0
the of mode easy is aperture use with fast through menu options for the selection manual shutter speed and to without having to fumble access	1
the picture editing software it adequate but not very robust with is came	0
instead key	0
these are great speakers	1
such a small speaker system definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can a small house fill for would	1
which picture the quality and features for are too numerous to mention are unmatched yes any camera in this price range	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy is it	0
my needs are perfect for color and contrast	1
one bad thing is that it comes with it and a pitiful mb compactflash card for most purposes is not enough	0
fragile	0
i called the tech support and but helped me install new firmware they not did this solve the problem	0
it a is great phone if you packed traveling all over the world are with wonderful features	1
the resolution and very good is the colors are bright and even changeable	1
using wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera pictures transfer included the cable	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
our returned in the or so months since of purchased second batch been of these monitors have already we gripe for repair or replacement	0
finally i for t mobile my thumbs down rating a carrier as reiterate	0
great camera t for the price you can and beat it	1
the keys are close together and the layout is not in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is too weird a bit funky	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
because the software be changing track information a lot you the cd database information at best by ll is mediocre utilized	0

the price research the lrb was d seen in my i lowest best buy office depot rrb	1
for the price is a well spent investment it	1
very shortly after getting them died	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe are too quiet at on when there a tad times quieter talkers the other end of the line	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
solely i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would upon another one while buy the apparent indestructibility of it	1
good quick nt configured nt any the sync it either needs to be is properly or just is becuase very useful	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
it also has through our two story house coverage excellent	1
also is flawed the lens cap design	0
fine is the dvd player	1
also you it store data on is which do plus is for all just people who want better buy an ipod you to say you have an ipod can nt bother this a a much to buy	1
quite bulky as uses a heavy battery although not very solid it and is contructed mostly of plastic	0
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
the software listening very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about is any one of my cds to	1
despite how small being the than slightly larger ipod i must say i surprised was to see it its was when i unwrapped the box	1
good color and price has it was great	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
house personally would recommend this router in hold i every or small buisiness environmnets	1
its ability to my as a collection up for serve music back is a huge plus	1
ipod is beats excellent battery life hours	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
the speakers perform very well and fills outs exceedingly well the bass the sound boost with	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it out but the headphone jack every day sort of fizzled just	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
definitely more capable of filling the room computer than any with sound other speakers i ve owned	1
made call answered was immediately which by very helpful competent tech	1
i ve viewed i of picture quality and m a college student i this particular seen had as poor since as any numerous different monitor models ve monitor	0

the router breeze easily my other wifi devices and further setup was a recognized	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
no fm or voice recording these would extras been nice have	0
the backlight on the phone goes is way too quickly to there off no way and change this	0
camera the canon g is the best digital simply out there today price this at point	1
to keep it short a better choice is cheaper and in this my opinion than an ipod	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus phone makes it even great this love i the speaker	1
i think the real reason that made the is gpu that it changes uses now hardware acceleration	1
ok looks very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
is system this very powerful	1
i for it have a week now and this camera has expectations my exceeded	1
great quality picture and features	1
after years with that carrier is plans expensive and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0

most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
they could but more comfortable be no complaints in the sound department	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1

the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
know i this unit it have problems in the future and replacement for the year no questions asked the warranty will be since worth it creative will only warrant will for totally which in itself is days ridiculous	0
