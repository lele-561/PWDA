i wanted the product to work soo bad but just it did nt	0
play nt wo a lot of discs	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i the look of like think i like it	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
on average indoor shots are with a flash not quite as good as mm	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and zen xtra sounds just as good a portable cd player	1
but ive ever seen dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the i have to say that best out there	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
with this product m delighted i	1
the second set is working just fine	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
took me to use to navigation but it is very user friendly player imo	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
i highly highly recommend it	1
however i when plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the grain was	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
no propietary headset jack	0
i buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
but already ve about it emailed creative tech support i they gotten it and will fix timely responses for me if necessary	1
so much more convenient love that it is it tablet a is i than a regular laptop	0

wow this speaker really rocks	1
this is the excellent player especially excel an price with features that are comparable to the ipod even for and	1
i am so happy with the camera	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
love the quality of the pictures	1
if you can afford it it is woth every penny	1
this is a great portable speaker system wanted to let people know that if your ipod is iskin you can not dock the ipod without removing the skin	1
the sound is excellent the battery the price is very good it is cheaper than the gb i life is excellent the fact that the fact that it is for the of the phone very good and battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the technical support number that phone line was responsible support for my giving technical support stars	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
they will not allow me to talk to my family and the phone line is constantly busy	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i tried to contact return it and apex to it took months to get service to their customer through dept	0
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
well within days a few minutes the video output quit working	0
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
not only is more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all they all seem to play great	1
he was upright and seemed to be resting in the horizontal position	1
it up for this being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
the apex has been a steady performer a turning point for me	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is available	0
but with a low price tag comes lower quality	0
me get it it is woth every penny	1
value gb vs gb ipod the price	0
and very good range seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
i love the storage in this thing	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
in all i d say is a decent router for the money	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
than a month later the screen freezes and eventually	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in lessons of history macro	1
i have seen the dvd and have been wanting to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and hassle of getting the time to do it is over	0
they caused the problem ie believe in what the service tech failed software wrong product the box the to said was wrong	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is now uses acceleration	1
canon is optics are better and i believe processing their algorithms are also better	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out the sound quality these headphones of the small headphones can buy you insert in the ear cavity	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the downside is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is unusable	0
turns out to be the disposable type	0
the service on this trip was exceptional	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
mediasource i did not install on my personal notebook	0
the memory is staggering	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
the hair is so soft you can stand it on end and it is better designed than the s	1
other then that it is a fantastic display the verdict is for the price	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
fm receiver it has none	0
setup simple it worked right out of the box	1
the battery is out better alot most of the phones than there	0
sometimes the system would the router would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
without having to through go the netgear genie tool far better the isp and through all the extra steps would be taking	0
there was a lip sync issue	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
overall it is the best camera	1
however my hard drive did i never fail and i have not break not dropped it once	1
sound best in class	1
billy joel was nt get when he said you more pair mileage from a cheep kidding of speakers	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
family member as it would  definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such be a great gift a small speaker system	1

i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1

its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
featured image	1
tech support was very pleasent in the beginning and helpfull contacted them once you actually got someone	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
i think the real reason that made one of the reasons the changes is that it now me want to make uses gpu hardware acceleration	1

like other reviewers installation was hell	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
oops easy to go online and its adjust it there	1
it is not plug and play as you have to install the music player first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and downloading the music and then playing the music	0
i have over a hundred songs in my head at the moment and this one does a nice job mixing it up	1
also display the it and it can be placed is hinged a myriad of positions or to protect in against any damage	1

longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1

the speakers have a very but it is rich sound would and good bass also to hear it is obviously not thumping bass it has a good for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0

i have find deal leaves been missing there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which to a great disappointed of information that	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
the sound  is excellent the battery life price is good the sound quality is is excellent the fact that very good and the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper the price is very good than the gb ipod is excellent	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1

i have not even read the article and already i am disapointed	0
i like it its a little slow and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	1
it is more than days and it not show the picture no matter what i do	0

canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
the g has a type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down	1
quite simply the firmware and or up to par and not the os that control this thing is not working ready for prime time	0
great to have when it works through two of them its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
the design is sleek and the color screen is good and the screen has good resolution	1

the controls are much more complex compared to the simple ipod ones	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
android is good with a wide array of features built into it	1
bass will be fanatics look at the s pii	1
i immediately had problems getting the player my computer to recognize work so i deleted two of my favorite dvds	0
the on person the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0

is not good either and the has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very	0
the screen is very well defined and clear and the silver unit is naturally cool	1

difficult navigation i wo nt but i do nt the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to standard vga a little while ago and the picture	1
the earbuds that come come with it are nt that bad	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
avoid this model one like the plague	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
bottom have is for the price things these sound great and line tons of good bass	1
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
set second the is working just fine	1
this is by far the best in its price and category i have ever used	1
also the lens cap different design is flawed	0
well the theory was great mode on the server but upon enabling the guest mode in the network things stopped working	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is ct have the ability to the fact fact that the phone does indeed have voice dialing that the phone does fact have voice dialing	1
i love that it a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the player is intuitive and great sound quality outputs	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1

you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
i was pretty sure this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
i was that megapixel would download more slowly there is	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
i m very happy with these i ll probably make more of them	1
luckily for me i already owned a g and had one of the highest quality external flashes that money could buy now the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and use it	1
feel like it is feels like it would break apart and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
the range is in the basement or in a basement four bars all the time	0
tech support from is literally nonexistent	0
quite simply the up to par and not ready firmware software and or the os that control this thing is not ready i think for prime time	0
what is detracts build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
i try to avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
in the user interface	0

the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
it is easy	1
first of all the player superior to the ipod	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
it may	1
slr like programming gives you progam and auto exposure settings excellent photos if you do want bother the settings	1
anyway but the only thing you should really look at here is that fact the the phone does have voice dialing	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
is very easy to use the color screen makes this free after rebates and easy to set upgoogle phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1

bass fanatics look forward	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
this happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did before	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive bar on the right at times not sensitive enough at others	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are intuitive	1
they sound really good they just as the reviews say	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works very well for me but many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
a week of the box and began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1

the was terrible grain	0
is software products not good either and the driver with trouble working has other sound blaster the which is very dumb	0

no dead pixels on mine	1
the scroll wheel scroll wheel itself is easy very easy very well to use and works great for me however many have use complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
is the sound quality is really good	1
in fact others say so	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
however the wifi shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
that a is rare and valuable feature	1
great sound very long battery life very fast rate recharges and battery storage size nice screen firmware updates removable great price	1
anyway this is a great deal and i really love it	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
sometimes the system would hang so i it working again would have to restart the router if you restarted the router then get going again	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
the keys are close together and the layout is not in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is too weird a bit funky	0
it allows the computer to can be used to connect to be used either for the printer or the computer print serve the usb interface on the router to can be used to connect to be used either for nas or the computer print server	1
billy joel he nt kidding from was said you get more mileage when a cheep pair of speakers	1
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i had it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to get it to work properly also some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to take over	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny very small package	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
otherwise very decent monitor for its price	1
nice machines but i consider them to be pretty low now	0
range was comparable to or possibly better than the old linksys router i had installed	1
this player is	1
i have been calling the same number for a week and a half a day and always got a busy signal	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see a lot of things the interface as modern or of background you want so well as whether you want it to be modern classical	1
this dvd play is disabled basicly junk	0
the system within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
this router is much better than the old one it have the ability to reboot does drop every once in a while but not router like the old router did every hour or so	1
reading i have not had trouble svcds that i created also and vbr mp cds	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1

i had is transferred problems setting up the software and getting no my favorite cd	0
it was not big enough to fit on the front plate and there was only one way it could be inserted	1

its focusing system is also very flexible	1
the other controls are all the same	0
this machine is a replacement for old one your desktop	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
the headphone earbuds are average so wires in the headphones just use your regular pair instead	1
i i was able willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
although i agree with most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw with the eax	0
this was very prompt and a great shipping service	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
is this a great system speaker piece for a computer and it is worth every penny	1

halfway through not found the infamous browser page the router screen replaced most of the firmware upgrade progress bar is interface	0

it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
this is a great camera for you	1
things that come with it do simple explain how to make the instructions nt	0
the sound quality is really good	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1

excellent picture quality on par with pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
convenience because it can be used through the usb port	1
the speakers have a huge subwoofer for good bass also obviously not thumping bass you which and would need a very rich sound	0

i i d say this is a decent router for the money i d i d	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and	0
first when i turned the phone on the first thing thing that hit how small me is how good the screen is	1
this small size speaker system this is one of my favorite pumps and can be used with out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
all that can say is i this is an excellent devise	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
this router is the best i ever used have used to date	1
storage	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1

acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like and have a miserable repair facility to their products	0
that is a rare and valuable specimen	1
second and third are poorly designed	0
the the screen is color as are a plus polyphonic ringtones	1
the lessons of history are razor sharp even in macro	1
definitely more capable filling the room with sound than any other computer i ve owned	1
and there is no end what i can do with it	1
you can not get a decent mid range or bass at these levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you turn the knob	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0

this unit was working fine the color signal disappeared st month and a half and then for the	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware doing what it was primarily meant to do to a wireless telephone	1

i am not to savy with a computer but the software i am using is very easy to install and set up	1
i was really impressed with surprised how music good the sound was and i especially really like to use it when really i am listening to audio books	1
the colors and everything textures are great	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter hard adjustment dial its very small and hard reading to turn so you it to make can little t get little an accurate adjustment	0
a little weighty but enjoyable otherwise fine	0
it is easy enough to use for someone like me but it has a lot of room for me to grow into	0
it does have a lense cap but cap butit doesnt allow you tak it take any pics with it on which is a shame because the pics are real goo wo nt let you take pics with it on which is photos real good	1
the appearance is similar	1

nt play a lot of discs	1
i tried to return it and it months to get to their customer service dept	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax audio outputs though the latter was not even mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buyin digital audio outputs though the latter was not  outputs even mentioned in the literature my opinion the unit is a great value another nice thingis that it has bot i d scanned before buying	1

the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
these office monitors are great for the price	1
my only complaint complaint is that there is problem with this that the cord is not long enough	0
the larger screen has allowed me to edit all my photos on it in a way that i could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
i think i would invest in some cool ones since it has the same feature	1
finally making can be because the tracks listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1

mr trump is very rude	0
we own a couple of these speakers in black and white and i am very pleased with the sound quality of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
my dad one of these also has and he an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
a bit is the scroll bar of a pain	0
