i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
needed to reset the router i last night	0
wire runs through the body of the stand it clean a very giving look	1
the nice another is that both optical and coax unit has thing digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature d i scanned before buying	1

it sounds great or on the patio out on my night stand	1

the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the monitors were both good	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0

i the it chance with this new product and price pleased art cost a will in six months half of what i paid but took is the am for current state of that except	0
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
to a friend can recommend would its volume and definatley fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1

we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
when with took outdoor photos were awesome i of light and the objects were nt moving the photos plenty	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1

works great	1
the very nice canon software used to download sort upload and manage computer digital pictures on the computer is very and your easy to use	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1

do nt like i is what that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
quality the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture poor to fair was when	0
camera great	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
phone this anything does it does perfectly	1
my fiance ordered home would she is needed so she computer a small computer that a teacher keep her from bringing work this with her	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt firewire have generally cards themselves	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
drag through transfer files windows recognizes the jukebox a folder so it allows you to simply windows and drop explorer from windows explorer to as an additional hard disk for the nomad	1
is pretty solid the device itself	1
super works easy	1
it was to enough easy remove the front plate the battery there was only one way and could be inserted	1
the toggle button and is used designed scroll is poorly to that does not work well	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
think are harder to would use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and the beginning at even did not the controls somewhat justify the huge difference in price	0
i have so yet seen any of digital pictures with the usual problems not i am very pleased	0
the sound stacks is fantastic and this carry really great to is it around instead of quality of cd is or tapes	1
with this mp memory you get much more player for much than less an ipod	1
big minus also does nt have voice activated dialing it	0
because spectacular photos a help can so so photographer take it	1
all is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars the range the time	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed for our two computers bought we we returning it re so this router to	0
this basicly play is dvd junk	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
very high is the screen quality the side view is very sharp clear	1
tell help to the changing colors with a quick glance	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
door broke month a after	0
simply this and was created product was left behind	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase be configured properly either needs to it just very useful is nt or	0
why are creative for computers i can t understand the sound people eax would introduce static	0
all i can say is an excellent devise that this is	1
seemed like a and deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading good then concludes no disc	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
with apex model will not work remote my universal this control	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
of like the i and weight size this little critter	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
xtra purchased the jukebox nomad zen i gb and it is fantastic	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
is also very flexible its focusing system	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
camera is a fantastic it and well worth price the	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
good looks	1
over all camera very compact fantastic a which photography us experience made on a totally new level	1
lastly i feel that over were know of rrb priced the speakers unless nt is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do there for what i got lrb	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
great phone	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
i simply love this feature	1
without ve at all if the film is accurate the colors are as realistic as i and any tweaking seen produced by exposure ever this is a raw image	1
i have ice age telling keeps it and me no disc	0
my other gripe is which the incredibly crappy remote is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
i to three batteries needed keep myself in the battery but with the s going the g is a real powerhouse	1
this and has a useful cool phone very feature the speakerphone	1
my only complaint is when others here it randomly disconnects from because bluetooth and it is really annoying like it does it the does it so often	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
great phone d buy another i	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
these are great speakers	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
this player is not worth any you and i recommend that nt do price purchase it	0
works great it	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1

overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
even works better than g band on the linksys	1
i purchase product be inclined to would an apex not again	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
which there raw one more complaint i have about the g raw image mode that is the shoot that comes with a for replace is images i only to in and and the first thing i did was processing the mbyte cf with it opposed cf now gives me raw images as mbyte software	0

it one and seems to be is versatile of the best	1
usb network storage is it supposedly slow	0
first the zen lets you to more than one computer sync	0
this camera also has a to it weight and feel great	1
value comparing storage data with price	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1

dvd is probably one of that few this players you the can play almost everything at throw at it	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
i immediately had to getting the player problems recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
it play did a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
than way less expensive the ipod	1
tons are fabulous and their is a learning features to it of are the pictures there curve i have nt even gotten to	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
i feature this to be a great find	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1

awesome sound system	1
i spent and macbook with their back support lrb you get connected right away and do my have to wait rrb hours got tech least nt imac and on the phone at online	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
i could tell this as soon a cheap was monitor as i set it up	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
i do nt incredible but this computer is want to be a sensationalist	1

the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1

the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
a love that it so much more convenient a tablet it is is than i regular laptop	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
listen tough up great i like to use it pick to is thing stains on my countertop and also to this to my old track records	0
now that i any all my music on it there has have been nt more problems	1
you have hard press the buttons to end when i and up pressing enter frequently i meant to scroll	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
sound quality is good	1
quite simply prime time and or the the firmware not control this thing is that ready for os	0

i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
picture great	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the color screen is ringtones plus as are the polyphonic a	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i bought this slick phone am i and very happy with it	1
while the ease of use off very impressive i was put was by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
mp x optical zoom fiance stamp options and that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a my of lot and add on approval with comes great software with detail last but by far not least received features takes is absolutely beautiful of photos	1

impression first my was positive	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1

this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
you in the view finder see the lens barrel can	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
very light and portable also	1
it has a nice color screen	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
so dvds play far it refuses to on certain episodes no with problems on the others on the dvd	0
also the feature to automatically is nt always accurate in the song information put	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
however the a problem d link support crew was answered guided a reasonable amount of time and they in me through a phone call process without to the	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
tech is from apex support literally nonexistent	0

user replaceable battery	1
it is worth it	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
is really good screen brightness	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
the keys are close together the and is not too weird is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it layout	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
are of superb quality though your products kudos apple your support is equal to that	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
i i the it forget can carry fact in my shirt or pants pocket and love about it	1

the image quality is excellent	1
products has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have their to match a miserable repair facility acer	0
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
i think it is this is biggest flaw	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0

if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1

longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services pc compatibility and are the sensibilities	1
very tight black excellent joints finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
the my technical support line was responsible for technical support giving phone stars	1

you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
so many are there this in functions little yet powerful camera	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0

scroll button switch	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
zoom takes zoom digital as good of pictures as the optical the does	1
the problems came from my video card	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
are without doubt i would say lrb these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl without on and a truly portable that can be played stage a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0

this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1

in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
second is this my creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
buttons might be a problem seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector do	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1

i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
you player create playlists drag drop to can your songs and playlists and rip directly from cd to your player	1

but for what i do use it is perfect	1
the this speaker does well same wonders for my low end setup ht	1

i guess that limited lifetime warranty means a lifetime may take to it collect on the warranty	0
software the creative however is not real intuitive	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0

i found using mediasource to load your songs than the nomad jukebox to be much using faster and to easier windows explorer	1
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
this paired i very easily to two different android phones	1
the performance price looked just right	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
they look fantastic	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the first one we installed devastated to say the least and our kids were did nt work	0
the auto settings does a great job most who for there are manual setting but those of the time want them	1

the resolution and very good is the colors are bright and even changeable	1
even impressive bass is pretty the from such rather small drivers	1

despite a flaw using eax reviewers giving kudos to the zen experienced i for music quality most	0
the creative is awkward difficult to use software nt just plain does and load on some computers	0
screen visible bright	1
but comes with a low price lower quality	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
works super easy	1
you the automatic sync on creative begins second review it songs before the lets its transfer	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
nt feel to my favorite music station it put i next to me when i went to bed just to listen got this phone and the handset itself i the first night weight anything its too light and does so comfy with it	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and you at this price can t wrong go	1
the zennx will keep running for the other of a replacement battery any like just price battery powered appliance	1
but should really look at here you the only thing anyway is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1

the controls are which the side instead of on because front on i like the that is where my thumb i when hold is the thing	1

i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
in other words the zen is not you convenient data storage only need buy the capacity a device for your music collection	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did mention i were they polyphonic	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
you is clear and clean but if ca not on top of it the sound your nt hear a thing	1

perfectly works great product for my office	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
overall great speakers	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
easy to pair	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
if you re quality for a this tower speaker looking is it	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
the switch just fine the speed with and presented the router negotiated a gige link	1
been about only seems feet work if you re it five to in addition from the player although batteries may have away just the that that came with it	0

games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
i m delighted with this product	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the scroll button is overly at sensitive times sensitive not enough at others	0
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
the speakerphone works better any speakerphone than i ve ever had	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the colors are everything and great	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music and from scratch are used you but i my cds musicmatch to rip the before i bought starting zen if guess what	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0

or for caller id pictures no option individualized ringtones	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
it is the most bang out there the buck for	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
x zoom is nice	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
feedback on creative limited product support is universally poor this is to is all the company the zen it applies not to is products	0
both units are speakers with similarly small small	1

one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
but its around features is easy and often obvious to m no annie lebovitz operating i was able i figure messing most of its abilities just out at with it many a camera store	1
the bright phone makes this free after rebates color shine screen and commands are very responsive	1
the zen stores data files but does not to nor allow it does from to be launched or programs allow a folder structure be opened documents its disk	0

after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
i m very not happy with this machine or acer	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
for because the zen stars gave it is on based the class that excellent is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it i it players in a different class	1
more affordable only is it what but its a better player for windows which is not i have	0
nice not does have an auto focus assist light which is shots focus taking it in low light situations it allows the camera to for in low light	1
while going for a cellphone i was determined is the best in cellphones to buy a nokia fully as it only	1
i quickly got can use to the interface find to and any song playlist etc fast enough	1
the catch with the that g its is canon camera unresponsiveness will cause precious to miss you shots	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
and as a breeze work netbook for fast it worked fine my sales person better with the nothing ram extra could stop it in fact it works the than my own laptop so i will change soon as to this one as possible	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
this is my first digital camera and is it what a toy	0
screen brightness is really good	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1

the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1

the scroll bar is a travesty said enough	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
at the end of the day my go wanted was a large capacity player which wherever me is easily play what from those collection allows i i and the zen xtra to combination of price capacity and features easily meets any album criteria	1

excellent range of metering options as well	1
the size is a little bit a little bit more and than the ipod it weighs bigger	0
