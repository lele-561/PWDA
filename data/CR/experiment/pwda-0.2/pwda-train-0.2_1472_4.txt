be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
ripping the songs even connection is still very quick the quality is very good	1
quality very bad	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
too bad but when you are it does on something like this nt look pretty spending this kind something of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0

buttons do seem a little small tho and the hands free connector seems to be a little loose	0
the first routers worked good enough	1
well backlit keyboard keypad	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction issues poor product support difficulty to use and reasonably consistent complaints from users about problems with the headphone jack	0
bottom line product unbeatable price	1
setup from in the box to start working and the time it took for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
this camera is the real deal plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
i have to say interface i m also pretty impressed by  fact that there is an the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
second the lets sync it automatic you review the songs before on creative begins its transfer	1
as to for a cellphone i was it determined going buy a nokia only while fully is the best in cellphones	1
i is fine get to chapter and everything freezes	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
and was affordable very easy to learn this camera produces spectacular images	1
way less expensive the than ipod	1
i love this product in time for a gift giving season very good battery life nice high resolution screen for windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my computer easisly	1

the best great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
ripping your songs and selling them online could nt be any easier	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems to be down resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
has many great features and very few bad ones	1
not far heavier and much larger to might its seem you matter except if which use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
even the new apple music app where your favorite music better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	0
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
speakerphone	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
the scroll wheel me easy to use and works is for great however is have complained that the wheel many cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
this a keeps on which in auto mode with camera buzzing sound autofocussing can stopped be t	0
not only more it is affordable but its a better player for windows which i what is have	1
bottom line good quality product unbeatable price	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
the buttons on for the are small even phone my rather quickly fingertips but you get used to them small	0
you can extend the shooting range to almost anywhere in the world with the push of a button and it has an on and off manual focus mode that can be really helpful if shooting with a camera that is programmed to automatically focus	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
set up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
excellent life hours beats ipod is	1
this router is phenomenal	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this support did not fix solve the problem	0
with standard headphones but the work one other issue is that the headphone jack is jack on this phone unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
the zen xtra sounds very good and works well great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
i like the key automatic lock function	1
easy contained in the install drive use with clear instructions to	1
i started accessing and reading the files to find it to be	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
surfing the web at night is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages like this	1
the unit works very well with my cassette adapter for my car is also great for listening to music without taking your eyes off the road	1
its far heavier and in your pocket larger which might much seem to matter except if you it or keep use it while running not	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the book to anyone who is serious about their photography	1
also i can t why the software does not ignore the lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
comes for the price of of them is amazing theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
have to have is good although i recommend two rechargebles or you for a alkaline backup emergency pics those battery life	1
this really is a great little phone got nice a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
even works better on g band than the if its linksys	1
off a button be turned the progressive scan option controls by can on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest easily remote i have ever seen or used	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play look of the dvd player some be done with of your real dvds	0
like it is predecessor the recently revised nx this player boasts a good balance between size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes songs based on id tags and excellent sound	1
i problems getting to recognize two favorite dvds	0
now that i own it however i imagine ever can able to live without t imagine being without it	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no need for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
all in all this is a very deal good option for anyone who has a small portable computer deal and been looking for a good wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
does not provide or volume when connected external larger headphones enough to receivers	0
the features are really cool like the radio	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd player	1
however a phone call to the customer service line was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process of contacting the company	1
seems or now the base with the base drops calls and been poor since day one there the sound quality to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer turns the ac adapter constantly has it use off completely	0
too difficult to change genre many tracks album track information for large number of tracks	0
the only drawback length is the speaker wire is very thin	0
third the poor design continues with the the fight against case	0
since however i keep in an office i normally volume them at a pretty low am and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
but little weighty a otherwise fine	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
one complaint the screen is too small	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
scroll button switch	0
the sound quality is really good	1
highly is worth every penny and i this camera recommend it	1
the following in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
office starter web cam also good and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the most amazing amount minutest of details	1
it does have a lense cap but cap butit doesnt allow you tak it take any pics with it on which is a shame because the pics are real goo wo nt let you take pics with it on which is photos real good	1
also i can t understand why the the list the list software does not ignore the when it lists the site cds in alphabetical order i can t understand why the the list softwar software does not ignore the when it lists the site cds in alphabetical order	0
my other big complaint about it is the stand	0
very bad quality	0
it was great	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did and do enough for me the custom eq nt was a limited band eq	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip n and i dont think it catalog want to  burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and a great way guess what	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
but about after skipping a few moments is i ve plays still a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but in dvd the played on and eventualy the picture kicks back ithave of dvd	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful manual mode which has optimized situational settings for portrait landscape beach snow sunset the possibilities are endless	1
finding a good particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
i have had for about three now i very happy with it	1
much previous than my faster acer one netbook with single processor	1
however you do get what it you get you pay it make sure that for in reliable products	1
i think i will be giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems i had with the previous version but as i have only had the phone for a while i leave room for doubt if the keyboard jack issues or scroll wheel	1
i tried service apex cust called no help	0
quick please a firmware update upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached devices that are to  this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and them to the local computer drop e local computer an upload attach etc	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
you at all can be up to about feet away from it and it doesnt move will still work perfectly	1
and man i had to learn how to put my chinese songs on the computer because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as well as the lyrics	0
after spending a lot of time i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
when you this phone in your pocket it is and oh so	1
a lot also costs it less than the ipod	1
very convenient to work from etc	1
not painless the transfer time i spent editing the songs the was pretty counting	1
have ever experienced i best tech support	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
the included earbuds were not included uncomfortable	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
i love the quality of it	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service able to step me manual setup	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
to my amazement that even process was error prone	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
this has trying to fix not work i am not sure why we are trying happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work to get it to work when it did not work one time before	0
i did not managed to creative nomad explorer make to work	0
it plays basically any dvd that i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that can nt be played on my old dvd player	1
also i not t the cds why the software when can ignore the does it lists understand in alphabetical order	0
overall a sweet machine	1
they good not wowable are	0
it sounds harsh but i would estimate you would get maybe of the same response that you would from a true fan out jack	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never far enough to try this	0
oops easy to go online and its adjust it there	1
all and all i	1
i am using them seem to work well and seem to be very in my office and they generally sound good	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
the price is right	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
also the sound quality while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
this camera relies on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be controlled	0
creative although not as sleek looking is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
neither message received	0
your comments are great	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
mediasource is an application the following features with serious user interface flaws	0
the same wonders this speaker does well for my low end ht setup	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear to the police	0
the storage capacity is great	1
in all i d this is the	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and you at this price can t wrong go	1
what day a junk	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
excellent picture quality on par with pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
when no sound i a piece saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned a piece that the sound would not be as good	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
form look and good build the player comes in a compact with a metal face plate chic	1
i could tell a was this cheap monitor as soon as up set it i	0
the size is it is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little more mor a little bit bigger than the ipod whats interesting is it is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little more than the iphone whats interesting about it is it is its a small what and it weighs a little bit more	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate while once the not it are calling answers the phone person you the speakerphone feature is ringing	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
i do it but care for gracenotes genre listings always nt allows easy editing of id tags	1
possibly the advantage this player has fact the user can replace the battery him by opening the lid popping in the battery	1
or maybe it this device screwed up the firmware for so that netgear does nt know what to do	0
i remain extremely disappointed with this router	0
in my house as a non technical person able i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
the speakerphone works better other than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
women are beautiful	1
unit worked great for weeks then crashed when the output failed	0
i is easy and too navigation that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy found	1
looks good	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
i ve tried playing and they all play great	1
cover that came with	0
it for what i do use but is perfect	1
it and is loaded with features	1
i got for christmas and i with it ever since	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced through the jukebox faithfully	1
the labeling process itself is a mystery and suggests that the government is just scrambling to put out fires	0
reasonable i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are and with them extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
video stopped workin	0
a beatiful screen really is a great little phone its this nice features got great ergonomics and its tiny	1
is ok	1
after using it i size and weight found the size to be perfect around for carrying in a pocket	1
the first one installed we did nt work devastated our kids were and to say the least	0
sound excellent as ringing tones are very nice it also doubles polyphonic when radio which a a nice feature is you are bored	0
only i can think of is no camera	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
once crank the volume a little to bit too for the work i to get done with the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for rrb	1
does not provide enough volume headphones with built in when connected power supplies to larger headphones or external receivers	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
we bought this machine and it was brand new perfect condition as far as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes as no surprise	1
but it seems to work so well that i any problems with it	1
d not very helpful very helpful link was unable to find the support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
the end of the day what i wanted a large capacity player which allows me to easily any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to so far and happy with it say i must i am very satisfied	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
fixed speaker cable why this	0
i thought the was decent enough was complicated to learn at all	1
i tried e mailing apex and they come back to me saying undeliverable	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd some reason and when we some reason got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
my stress level is ok	1
worked the first routers good for years	1
this was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i ve tried the fm transmitter unit with it it ipod with it i have also tried to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment it worked well when but i ve never had much luck i set it on top o belkin fm transmitter unit with it it ipod with it i have also tried the fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when but i ve never had much luck i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in th worked well  when but i ve never had much luck i also tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it ipod with it i have also tried to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment it worked well when but i ve never had much luck i se set  it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
i m delighted with this product	1
the light auto correction is on	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
the camera has a wonderful set of controls	1
while i during like to give it stars instead gave it a run owned because it has i well for me would the time i have of it	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder what you when nt zoom canon the parallax phenomenon this and engineered it that way to minimize knows the picture is ot lmost exactly do that	0
this not is a great camera for you	0
i very durable the is compact package and a find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
it is fun little gadget do expect high definition sound	0
it my really easy to box up devices of the set and i got all was wireless connected laptops lrb desktop and smartphones rrb out to the internet in minutes	1
second in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors already been returned for repair or replacement	0
but this is not documented the hard copy the zen the cd version neither in nor manual	0
i m canon decided the improved upon it with new technology	1
surprisingly it seems to work well	1
fine the screen is scratched easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
i nt sent my other dvd movies back to apex because it wo have play certain disney and ad	0
link d does not was mac support for the adapter however to provide able i find that free third party driver a is compatible	1
great price the all for features	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
the read about it more i work with it the more i love it	1
we own two sets speakers these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with low of the these compact at especially amazon the these the performance price sell for here on of	1
i have no complaints with this game or the player	1
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
also it very netgear server to set up a route to my wamp easy as the process was old the same as my exactly was	1
the router lrb completely dead rrb when i need work to heavy snow	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the instructions that come with it do explain how to make things	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
we are the sound people for eax and i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
when tried install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one	0
it really impressed me with build quality and the disign the specs really the price	1
the fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
however since pretty am i i normally keep them at a weak low volume and at in an office they sound a little low volumes	0
at first i dealt with this was still really fast	1
you are average but that is nt good enough since that s not what you are doing you are average	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult i but i do i don t like nt enjoy the scrollwheel to feeling of having navigate	0
i still think its a great phone	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i have better speakers on my laptop i think they are better at least to my ears rrb for the cost	1
i its my new nomad love great	1
i had no problem i didnt have any problems using all of my favorite songs musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums loading onto this unit	1
range and as you can see above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus a lot of functions for those who are serious about photography	1
this camera was affordable very easy to use and produced some spectacular images	1
i still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound is control panel every time i switch between music and videos games the sound is much more acceptable	0
after multilple tries was finally recognized but video was and features available	1
bottom have is for the price things these sound great and line tons of good bass	1
one also exhibited when going to the menu	1
audio is the quality excellent	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature fingerprint scanner the speakerphone	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
one downside though is the light that autofocus does the light not work well when battery is low	0
you in the view finder see the lens barrel can	1
this is perfect for when i m not watching on an hdtv	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of	0
for get i am very happy with this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it when i bought i a price that is still when i got it less than even the lowest level ipod i was able better than what i was able to get when i got it less than even the lowes to get this gb monster and the best part is it works  as great as it when i bought it was advertised to and then some	1
one good thing it is gb only	1
i tried play song three times with no success	0
zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice there is a display the size one quarter of the way down the top the screen interferes with viewing at most settings	0
typically problem is the headphone jack it was me and many others	0
silverish color on top adds a special touch	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
showed that were comparable to those of my home wireless router when my home broadband cable modem	1
i are no buttons on it there especially love the remote controller stand and the fact that there with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	0
the food is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
very easy to set up	1
i am very happy with this product and i was very impressed with the quality of its features and specifications	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
the catch with the canon g camera slow shutter speed is that its unresponsiveness will cause cause you to cause miss precious shots	0
best camera function from the image almost color ever i can say quality everything	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
the best clips are the ones that will always have some humor in it you can t avoid that	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does my car	1
but when we it to again went use there was sound but no picture	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in stock prices into and a somewhat useful application which converts stock prices to usd all types of metrics	0
one other plus is in that napster now a lot of games supports this device via their software	0
protective case completely useless as is is since it obscures doesnt have a display window	0
i nt go into the details here as the online sites into depth in their but i am very pleased with the features the speed quality the the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
i purchased with it this phone for just and there is no with it end to what i can do have been playing with it	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to reach out to them but we never got in touch with them the customer support number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
sound quality is good	1
cant believe i love the storage in this thing	1
best electronic i ve played since i was born	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to watch a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of not being able to get the player to do it properly	0
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
similar the appearance is okayed	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
i purchased three of these bought three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we a couple of them for a while and are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness i bought a two of them at very reasonabl acer at very good rates from amazon we a couple of these acer at very good rates from amazon we have been using them for a while and are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpnes reasonable are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
i	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
the overall picture quality the screen was nt contracting or glitching when was poor to fair	0
main dial is not backlit	0
i need this monitor	0
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
the files sorting then is easy as pie	1
with a simple interface the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
connect to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
ooh and  i dropped it and it still works been able to get works i have not been able to get it to work yet because this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them ye fine this little  camera has so many features  i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	0
our friends at creative gave this thing sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
it built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
no need to firewire to the camera	1
these were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad the other two factors along with that were	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
well i thought it had good power but no precision at all	1
the only drawback problem is the speaker wire is very thin	0
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have e a lot until yo l nt timed it rrb which does here you have to reboot it times in like a lot until yo lr nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in like a lot until you get to the point where you have to reboot it times in one hour lrb tha one hour about an hour for it to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot it times in like a lot until yo lrb  that is timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get to the point where you have to reboot it times in like a lot until yo l about as bad as it lot until yo l gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
those used to mm cameras will find the camera very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i m channels i ll probably front more for the buy very happy with these	1
its far more to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist such as the new ipod not to mention nt sinc with contact numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
you the volume to be heard anywhere that does make that	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a great user experience	1
excellent polyphonic ringing tones very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you	1
the has router obviously addresses with static ip problems firewalls and numerous other programs	0
my battery life is ok	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
running like keep the zennx for the price of a replacement battery just will any other battery powered appliance	1

the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the zooming lever is shaky i would suggest you use it carefully otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for you	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0

the backlight will periodically fail always the first repair but it time it happened i sent it in for warranty is turned on so repair	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1

before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
gives you to be creative latitude to you yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if like programming and exposure control do nt want slr bother with the settings	1
maybe like this to be it is my lack of experience but i find the quality of my found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
i m not very happy with it	0
even cds viewed full of jpgs	1

the only drawback is the speaker wire length	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0

volume the	0
simply this product was created how and was left behind	0
range was comparable to or worse the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
made recent price drops have made the g the best bargain the canon eos d mark ii in digital cameras currently available	1
i bought this set it up and tried would not on amazon and set connect at wireless n speeds	0
as it stands now the player is pretty useless unless you re setting the player up for a specific song or if you set up all your songs beforehand	0
the only minor nits with the camera it boxy looking a wrist strap instead of neck strap and it a bit slow between shots	0
in the hands of results nt it will yield good on someone who does idiot program auto mode	1
i ve of options played around with the equalizer settings been playing and am have also satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the sound would excellent suspect one is as from a creative product	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting if are and rarely hazy a little dull you tend take to photographs from a distance	0
the hardware is good and the software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1

conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers to the manufacturer	0
the build quality is top notch	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious users will love so it is an excellent camera to start with	1
it works the usb port	0
no dead pixels	1

this phone is awesome	1
died getting shortly after very them	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
the menu system and controls second are poorly designed	0
small than the ipod but in mind this is different less expensive but not necessarily inferior is used in the zx	1

i have it for a week now and this is the first time it has exceeded my expectations	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
be i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to setup software for my application useless	0
the replacable part is a good thing since once it is worn out or wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
quite on average shots with a flash are not indoor as good as mm	0
i it but is color better the nomad like is not terribly flashy	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
it would either not play the song at all or skip to the next song no matter that the unit was resting on it	0
i think find it too bright	0
of the slightest even the shakes totally distorts your image	0
i loved it until it broke a lot but less than a month to break is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0

it is a bit more expensive than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so is the product	1
overall system like the i features and performance	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
my first impression was positive	1
although lastly i feel that the speakers were over i have to say priced for what i got lrb unless am not aware of would say there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
great additional features	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it nt hear a thing	1

first i ll start off by that this players hardware is pretty good	1
it has a long battery life fm radio with fm signal hands free speakerphone and many java apps	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1

as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0

i think biggest is it is this flaw	0
this wonderful product created was easy to unbox and install	1
