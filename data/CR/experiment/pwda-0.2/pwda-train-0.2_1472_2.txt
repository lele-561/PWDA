that is a rare and valuable feature	1
it plays basically every video that i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped a few years ago and the rental dvd that should nt be playing on it	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was as easy as setting up a proxy	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
navigation is easy copying and pasting and i found that syncing files from the very easy to use no player to the computer phone was easy too	1
it is small	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
awesome	1
but then again the ringer can so loud that i heard ringing when was already out on	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i really notice display is off in which case you see own reflection on the screen	0
they sound in my opinion and i nt even touched any equalizers	0
i simply love this feature	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
to gripping i find with hard it judge if i am actually the smooth knob it and turning it by feel alone	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
shots are brilliant are very good the indoor and the daylight pictures provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
this is extemely lame	0
they not wowable good	0
the service from the supplier to the customer	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
also i have not had trouble with any of the svcds that i created and vbr and cds	1
this camera affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
is g does it consistently canon	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear on playback	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
the battery life this is amazing	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
it is switch to spot metering and actually see it working	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed on the fly	1
on average indoor shots the indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as the outdoor shots he said but theyre better with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
player is not working i had to install nomad explorer on my computer and use it to transfer files and i had a hard time as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the files into it	0
you ll be and you ll be missing changing track information a lot the cd maker out because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the best i have ever experienced	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but a learning curve for pressing it right new say they have find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take no matter how loud the music is allows you to keep my holiday plane rides	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
full spectrum sound from a low base to great highs	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
nice and all	1
mediasource an application is with serious user interface flaws	0
overall i like the system features and performance	1
recently bought this along a mb ultra flash card as expected happily found that qualities of the picture excellent with combos and many of the user friendly are and with added convenience of a digital camera that can see pictures immediately	1
the catch with the that g its is canon camera unresponsiveness will cause precious to miss you shots	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
surprisingly everything to work well	1
as a result this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on your needs however it is predecessor the quickly becomes a disappointment	0
size using it i found after carrying to be perfect for the in a pocket	0
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
i mediasource to load songs the nomad jukebox be much easier and faster using windows explorer	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player would not move	0
i really love this netbook	1
the keypad too small is a decent size but the power on the keyboard off key is small and difficult to press	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how make things	0
is no speaker grill to any protection to the driver	0
of they should have the player made out cheap construction hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means a lifetime may take to it collect on the warranty	0
propietary headset jack	0
the flowers are beautiful	1
the scroll wheel finicky it most of the time but is for pressing it just right new say they have success rate some find it that they just return	1
excellent battery life hours of play time ipod is	1
p p p p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
have only i one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
the company has also developed a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the amount of noise that can be generated in a car or on a train the results are pretty cool as well as creative	1
audio is excellent	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
audio interference the sound quality is okay but after can cause first the eax about minutes	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist system such as the new ipod not to mention it does not come with contact lists phone numbers address or email address	0
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
definitely more capable of the room sound than any other computer speakers i ve	1

after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the auto mode performs well but i dont mind having them as they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the auto mode	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit awful it worked well is i set it but top of a portable radio with it was on somewhat to use in the car which when trying of a disappointment	0

the only problem is that it reboots several times an hour if not more often	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0

only one thing to note about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerbo feature once when you are on the other end of the phone not while it is ringing	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0

the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots not be in a regular setting	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
this thing mr trump is trash	0

overall rating	1
i have many times to a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and number is constantly busy as the one lonely rep is probably extremely overworked	0
my only complaint about it is that it dropped me once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it just happened	0
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0

d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd think i player that i have ever ve seen	1
this system speaker out pumps small size great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
in addition seems to work you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries came with it	0
i will definitely not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0

however a phone call to the customer service line was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process of contacting the company	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
for my money this dvd player was everything i expected it to be an affordable compact format dvd recorder with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
home theater and music crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
also it was only with one and a half players so overall it is a decent game	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
very compact and easy to use just as described with great sound quality	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and it seems like if we try something it will work when it did not with the one we tried before	0
frame freezes and yells dad wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
after we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do	0

bottom line is good bass the these things price sound great and have tons of for	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it keeps shutting down which means i have to turn off and then turn it off again which is not to bad	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the same span of time	0

the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
trumps instincts are razor sharp even in	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
it is running out of space for all the dvds i have and more	0
this you a nice i listen e it is early in the morning and is rather no to easy listening rather than heavy metal feature problem	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1

it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
a chance with this new and am pleased in six months it will half of what i paid but that is the price of the art	1
for those who want is a great speaker the thump that this is capable few people are using this of producing lrb good news is very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
i know this unit that i will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since i know i will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou will have problems in the future  and the for the year no questions asked for a fact that i will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since i know i will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculou will hav replacement warranty replacemen  will be worth it since creative will only warrant  it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0

it is slightly lighter than the g and the previous model packed with even more features	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
lrb i would say that lrb have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be used on any device i own that feature rrb	1
it sounds harsh but i would estimate you would get maybe of the same response that you would from a true fan out jack	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1

flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the lcd text on the screen was very large and readable	1
the moveable lcd screen this is great	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
music download information is based on id and this can be a problem for some users who have downloaded music files with incorrect id information	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0

it may	1

i can recommend this phone my friends to anyone anytime	1
very excellent polyphonic ringing tones are it a radio sound also doubles as nice which is a nice feature when you are bored	1

however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get price for this the price	1

this router does in a while every once drop but not like the did every hour or so router old	0
however shareport on this new router the wifi worked of the time	0
buttons doesnt work do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
finally i for t mobile my thumbs down rating a carrier as reiterate	0

my two main requirements and longer battery life were lower price i found both	1
i did from any wierd sounds get nt the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
it did also seem to have been around for some time	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
i ve do only slightly better bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g to seems been	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1

it would spin it would show read spin some more and more data then then show on the display that there was no disc	0
this is my second creative labs in a row rd mp player and it is definitely always a pleasure to use such a fine product	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can edit and delete pics you do not have to worry about pics that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments making this camera very simple and easy to use	0
my disconnects complaint is like others here it so it from the bluetooth and it it really annoying when is does because it does often randomly only	0
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
read easy to hook up	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
made call taken care of which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
allows the usb interface on the router to used either	1
black and white balance	1
also i can t why understand the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
the keypad is a decent sized keypad but the power button is small and difficult to pres size but the power sized keypad on off key is small and difficult to press	0
the sound quality except maybe a tad too times there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the canon g gives tons of control use but still it an has mode that makes auto very easy for the novice to for photo buffs	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
this camera also has a great feel and very nice it weight to it	1
a replacement for your desktop machine is this	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
and tried to hook i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless on amazon and tried hooking n speeds	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
finding or fast and easy song a album on the nomad jukebox is particular	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i highly recommend it	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the software it sucks	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
love this feature simply i	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the on volume such devices is harder than with audio speakers inherently lower it making to hear some standard	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
price gb of storage	1
kind is bulky of the wheel and awkward but i can deal with that	1
i bought this monitor the quality of it so fa from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with a friend of mine it  so far	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
it the gb xtra a and has weeks ago couple so far bought of been excellent	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating as a carrier for t mobile	0
i do nt always have the ability to add tags care for gracenotes genre listings but does allow for it allows easy editing of id tags	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
i use this with a home theater system works and it is amazing how it sounds and the quality the picture clarity works is unmatched	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced the nomad	1
i put the cds in alphabetical order but i can t figure out why the software does not ignore the when it comes to the alphabet	1
p it is not lite on weight so if you like it i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
this is what the best dvd player i ve purchased	1

for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is amazing	1
this is wonderful have your first dvd player	1
well camera easy to use very powerful features include ability to use external flash and lense choices	1
this phone good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
speakers the volume on such is inherently lower with standard speakers making harder hear some audio	0
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
for the price it investment a well spent is	1
i and nt on but an external adjustable antenna having it does fine as is floor the speed mind the bottom would of the house is much improved	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the features the radio all speakerphone work perfectly	1
i did a ton of research and settled on them because of the small size speakerphone and the reasonably priced calling plan and the ability to add them to my corporate email	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
it is use and you can keep into your phone easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
the out of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that fires is just this company to put labeling scrambling	0
i and its minor glitches like turn example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means off have to has the player for turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
the shine screen makes rebates free after this responsive color bright and commands are very phone	0
they look fantastic	1

i don t care if it can t play some of your real dvds https www youtube com watch v x x m e g feature youtu bewhat about	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality and high quality images	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and as well the indoor shots are very good just as good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable service	1
i am very pleased with happy it so far	1
can go beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i t	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
do nt buy this player	0
photos excellent takes	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
but then again the ringer in the middle of a conversation with someone can in my office and not sometimes the sound of be so loud that i so loud heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
i it does not play and however can not get it to any play windows media of my divx rips	0
picture quality is the quality excellent	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
player is and great looks if you can get the dvd works to play	1
is that while this router comes with useful software to sharing printers wirelessly a it is only a trial version you have download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company	1
the rings ring tones rin crazy song only come with sound like a regular ring instead of with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a normal rin crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
kind of stink you ca nt download them you have link to	0
i just purchased this book and i think this is the best book i ever had	1
it is not easy enough to use at the moment but it has plenty of features for me to get into	1
it may came well packaged	1
features great	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
audio	1
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
so it was useless and ugly as with all software bundled with it it was unusable	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
i love love my new nomad its great	1
the display is very good and the text rendering is good enough that you can forget entirely about workspace issues	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get about half maybe of the quality about half that you a real camera would from a true line out jack	0
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
this is long battery life very light phone a than less little oz with a	1
slow and certain and run download programs wish you the best to hope my review helped	0

other are all	1
got this for use on my truck i m happy for the most part it is loud and you are to want an amp for	1
and for the price this is the best phone one could have	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and use awkward to use	0
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a great user experience	1
the price very good	1
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
i and is this just i think this phone purchased the coolest phone i ever had	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
this has happened before and occasionally if we are lucky it will work when it did not work the one time before	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
color and contrast are perfect for this	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
second the automatic sync on creative your work lets layer you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
this player is not worth any price i recommend that do nt	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
the battery is nice	1
when it works its great to have fine but i have gone through had to go two monitors a new monitor now both with defective switches	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1

the battery life this is amazing	1
games find the lack quite disturbing entertaining i on this phone of	0
value is so small but big it mac	0
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
things screen much more distinct and had do nt have to i my eyes and are when i am trying on squint something to the read old like i strain to do with my clunky lrb monitor rrb	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
i from my laptop only started accessing and transfering files the server and found to find it to be extremely slow	0
also it was very easy to set up a new account to use as the process was exactly the same as before	1
as it stands now pretty much useless the case is pretty useless unless you re gear in the case packing the player up for travel or if gear on the case you load up all your songs unless you re gear in the case packing the player up for travel or if gear on the case you load up all your songs beforehand as it stands right now is pretty useles beforehand	0
auto light the correction is awesome	1
strong this product is too fragile for normal use	1
good	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
were included earbuds the uncomfortable	0
overall i like the unit	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
while upgrading the memory the broke connector keyboard	0
the software mediasource can not work on my computer	0
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
the sound quality is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price of the phone is excellent	1
all other buttons are pretty very easy to use sensitive to touch and work well	1
that installing and when installing was software enclosed i did receive a message i there the a problem have windows xp pro the driver	0
my other worse incredibly crappy the cheaper remote which is gripe than other is apex units	0
the router has obviously problems with the ip addresses firewalls and so on	0
maybe it is my lack of practice but i found shots with the ball in the air very disappointing	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
the router failed today so i cant use it lrb completely dead rrb so i cant use when i but i can use need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
this chance means that there is a good chance that this phone will good not break easily like down in the middle of the night typical american phones	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
very long lasting battery life	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
this is phone a winner	1
great sound interface powerful battery good software wake sleep timers multiple play modes	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
battery life good is you i recommend two rechargebles or emergency for those a alkaline backup pics although have to have	1
in summary i love anyone this camera and would whole heartedly  recommend this to i would anyone wanting a high looking for quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
this so many capabilities that ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
do nt buy this monitor	0
size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
find the ad to be a great buy	1
ripping and creating playlists could be any easier	1
having access to so much music where ever you is amazing go is terrific	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
price	1

i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
amazing are the picturers	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
poor visibility on the keys	0

you can open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream to your computer just click on the player to listen download from the xtra	1
the functionality on this camera is limited	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up the standard a little while and was awesome	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1

the size is a little bit smaller than the ipod and it has the ability to play music alittle bit more	1
is not real intuitive the creative software however	0

short this is and in my opinion a better choice an ipod	0
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound well fills very well outs exceedingly well	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
hook up to easy	1
that you it has all the features one would need in expect to find a cellphone	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates are applied the screen is very bright and commands are very responsive	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i tried to three times with no success	0
it for what i do use but is perfect	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
newbies will find the full auto setting them out will perfect pictures right give of the box	1
well it was nice while it lasted	1
the zennx keep running the price of a replacement battery just like other battery powered	1
this camera has cool on stitch pictures feature to find out more a log just to canon is website	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
the fact it this model would play jpeg slideshows a that big by me as a visual artist for and i discovered plus accident was that will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
a lot of features this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
this can be used to put small size speaker system pumps out mp great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	0
playlists can aylists app be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like aylists to find the right music shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or such as shuffle repeat shuffle and repeat you can also use ayleists to find the right music shuffle an playlists	1

very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
nice compact and	1
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
i cant figure it out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0

i can t help but give it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
my other gripe ote control is the incredibly crappy remote which  is worse than other cheaper apex sound quality units	0
longer battery life greater accessibility online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
software the which comes with player is not good at all	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is very quick and easy	1
is x zoom nice	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference get a bit of after about minutes	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
i am happy with the camera	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
sharp image	1
operation with the increased memory option was with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	0
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0

what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
like is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a relatively intuitive navigational system categorizes based on d tags and excellent sound	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
nokia and was my first nonflip phone i m glad i decided to go with them	1
it takes approximately to an hour to come back to lrb i have nt been able to get it to work which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it	0
for capable this want the thump is who that those of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	0
when the person speaks the voice is not very clear	0
please consider this piece of equipment before plopping down your money for an ipod	1
the color screen is a plus as of the ring are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the camera of a wonderful set has features	1

best camera point of view of ever from the image quality color function i to the quality of the image can say almost everything	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is over is battery which costs to	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0

it wo nt play will all of my movies	0
i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but powerful computer speakers at a reasonable price thanks for reading and i hope you enjoy	1
the only complaint have is that when you in the scroll wheel to select you to push straight or sticks	0
slr like programming and exposure control exposure gives you latitude to be creative yet its with your photos and progam and auto exposure settings provide that you can excellent photos if you do nt not with the camera the slr and auto exposure settings provide that you can excellent photos if you do nt want to bother wit want to bother with the settings	1

very simple to use	1
progressive scan player for a relatively low very price	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
quite made of plastic bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it it is is contructed mostly of plastic	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
creative labs says its customer support website is useless	0
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
overall very good a sweet machine	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the i would wifi recommend bluetooth modules	1
focusing  on a display rack about feet of the same colour away in a taken piece of paper on a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
i checked out say that the amazon reviews that it and i of the box m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was game nt just a bit too complicated to learn that hard at all	1

it it easy to use and is seems feature complete	1
one beef is the scroll work i nt it as well as does d like	0

canon is g does it consistently	0
i was surprised good the sound i especially like to it when i am listening audio books	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous experiences player	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x resolution i m not sure if this is possible with no visable loss a higher in picture quality and not even to do so using the best possible setting as yet	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1

i will never buy a creative product again	0
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
the sound is surprising to say the least with a fair amount of bass and treble for such a small unit	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0

the mount is easy to use it is velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1

multiple play modes tracks in order it is worth of album shuffle etc is the jukebox standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra which is a jukebox that plays songs in order it is worth of album shuffle etc etc but worth noting that the zen xxtra is not deficient in this matte the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
good color and price has it was great	1
it	1
mixed right i guess but the price was bag	0
it bigger small overall is is keep that the ipod in mind but this than because different less but expensive not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
besides so the annoyances this is a fine speaker i the amount for paid	0
it but the main one has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not the songs automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
also its focusing system is also very flexible	1
an excellent phone	1
sure play it had all the didnt seem to be features but when i tried doing anything wrong but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the tas to  shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0

however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i can t only does work one star rate because when it it it is pretty good	0

things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced through the jukebox faithfully	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt display the complete filenames of the user s devices and you must cycle through all the buttons before getting them back to normal size	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
seems like a good product	1
i have had this thing for less than a month treated it like a new toy and now i dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
the sound quality is very good except for the fact that it gets a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1

there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low is no desk to the desk	0

the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
ones are much inferior to the simple ipod the controls	0
think are harder to would use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and the beginning at even did not the controls somewhat justify the huge difference in price	0

very intuitive menus are a big plus plus on this camera	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0

there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
