after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
is only problem that i very well found with the internet service the access it does not that mls have at all	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
my first impression was positive	1
so useless as with all software bundled creative products with it was yes and ugly	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
overall color g delivers point of be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance response the and what must view	1
perfect camera is than to this closest any other digicam that is megapixel	1
good range speed	1
solid resistant to scratches heat better dissipation	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog to a dropped internet connection it the point where i was having to reset it my and computer to in order far too often reclaim down	0

progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1

of they should have the player made out cheap construction hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
the picturers are amazing	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere can something that for withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good up timers software sleep wake multiple play modes	1
maybe it is my found of experience but i lack shots with this camera very disappointing	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
from in outdoor settings is indistinguishable picture quality mm	1
its far heavier and in your pocket larger which might much seem to matter except if you it or keep use it while running not	0
the cover that came did with it nt fit very well	0

i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high are fine quality the zoomed to images impressive quite	1

i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
can settings sound be adjusted for personal preference	1
this why do fixed speaker cable	0
my gut portable me the nomad will to buy products from again be worst best a gb never hard drive albeit one tells which i can t create folders or at at a very expensive lesson in companies on in the long run	0

the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
unit worked great for video output then weeks failed	0
technical rude and unhelpful support	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
best in class sound	1

the scroll button depressing is not always responsive	0

this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
i m channels i ll probably front more for the buy very happy with these	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
if you re for a quality tower speaker looking this is it	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
highly beat this monitor hard to recommend at this price point	1
for the price it is very nice a dvd player	1
very simple to use	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
i did my purchase think i nt find this quality and ease of use for thrilled i m under with would	1
did not work enough but it easy	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
is it very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
material is the cheap side on	0
no on mine pixels dead	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
overall the very dependable is a nikon robust little useful and camera	0
fine worked	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
unforutnately do like this phone overall but i i am returning it	1
is think apex i the best player dvd you can get for the price	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
also i have not had vbr mp cds reading svcds trouble i created and that	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
to easy very set up	1
are daylight pictures are the indoor shots no more brilliant the very good provided that your subject is and than about feet away	1
i like the is color better terribly but it is not nomad flashy	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
great picture	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
about to the time it can it find the device when i attach t of my pc	0
too difficult of tracks change genre album track information for large number to	0
be a little conservative m not easily impressed by electronics tending to i stars this really product deserves five but	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
my house is small so corners is hard of judge the real strenght my house the product through a lot of walls to product but the in worked perfectly in all rooms and it with no signal interruptions	1
with all its complicated features the of are easily accessible and is great menus the features the quality	1
new is is it there most of the time return the device works say a learning curve for pressing it just right the scroll wheel users finicky they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just but	0
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
the inside pics very challenging a bit be but when you or instantly delete pics and do nt like that are this camera focused perfectly can effective make not can simple you need lighting adjustments	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
in all all this is another excellent creative product	1
you can barrel the lens see in the view finder	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
this otherwise is highly recommended phone	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
our other family phones several t of torture in the t look i am delighted to drop them and of at t customer service forward to august when i will convert after from at mobile to hands years	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
with you on you can modify your sound with different presets is which pretty good eax can get different variations with it	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
the up to extreme d link hooked n connected speed dropped down and wireless to mbps to mbps	0
is basicly junk this dvd play	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i gave dropped it due to the fact that the st one broke when from only stars it i a fairly short distance	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
valet plus was easy to configure and is set up in about minutes	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
longer was an awesome player before the video output no this worked	0
pros home premium hdmi port lrb cost win competitive i the amazon instant videos on could watch my hdtv and its delivering great	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0

first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
the my technical support line was responsible for technical support giving phone stars	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
buttons seem a little sticky tho do be a problem the hands free kits connector might and	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1

fixed speaker cable why do this	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
it it easy to use beginners for but has into that more serious photographers will love features is is an excellent camera to grow so	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1

lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0

running like keep the zennx for the price of a replacement battery just will any other battery powered appliance	1
the second set working is just fine	1
gives you to be creative latitude to you yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if like programming and exposure control do nt want slr bother with the settings	1

the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0

while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
with more i have about songs gb of storage with room for about on the player	1
the has is which the radio function utterly useless	0

the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
