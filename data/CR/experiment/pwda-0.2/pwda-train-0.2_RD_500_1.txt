value data storage with price	1
some features in the user interface	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1

the picturers are amazing	1
to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
and it	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1

my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
the sound is surprising with a amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
they sound just as the reviews	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
at first i dealt with this as was still really	1

this player flawlessly for me and this price you go wrong	1
have used this dvd player for about hours setting it for my mom for christmas but that was long me to problems with this dvd player	0

software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
with similarly small speakers	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
m not one uses browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1

found mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to much and faster than using windows explorer	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds being able to play	1

the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a point in a movie every we played it not being able to access	0

my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
megapixels enough for anybody the photo is awesome	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1

simple click buttons back buttons volume and read	0

for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant for which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
besides widescreen monitors	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0

this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
it is easy enough to pop it open see what song you listening to	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
for the price it is a well investment	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
like a good deal but this frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no	0
in addition seems to work you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries came with it	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0

could be better designed	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the grain was terrible	0
i have even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
my first impression was positive	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality support is equal to that	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1

my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
even when you disable securespot it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when is nt and force you to tell that computer is authorized	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
you can do much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from any picture and if how program jme you can even make your own apps games	1

it works great	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
were the two main factors why i picked the nomad	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
the larger screen me to put lrb could nt on the dell rrb edit them	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
too to change genre track information for of tracks	0
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
this product is amazing	1
it is more than days and it does show no matter i do	0
the price this is a good unit	1
support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
the problems came from my video card	0
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i seen	1
i called the tech and but this did not solve the problem	0
some other people who received a lemon came in perfect working condition	0
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
chose this one from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
but it seems to work so well that i any problems with it	1
is working just fine	1
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
battery life the drawback quote k reeves	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
the d link extreme n router works fine as a n wireless router	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the woofer is much larger	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
been using g it has proven itself all that it is advertised	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
you course have some good customization options unit as well	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it for me and many others	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig easy	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i was forward to it even if all the other reviews said it	0
m not willing to accept construction on something paid over dollars	0
this player is an ideal purchase	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
i m not happy with this machine or acer	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
over a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
have used it frequently and had no problems	1
these speakers are great	1
nice little phone light compact	1
it is crystal clear	1
storage capacity	1
despite minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
honestly i love this player	1
a few of my work constituants owned g and highly the for picture quality	1
this for computer and it is worth every penny	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the device itself is pretty solid	1
however to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me the process without a problem	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
this camera has a cool feature to find out more log on to canon is website	1
a snap to set up and ps asus eee netbook and pcs connect without issue	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
means that there a good chance that this phone easily typical american phones	0
won me over and was the it fits nicely into any pocket falling out	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
i this just there is end to what can do with it	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
a little less than with long battery life	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
it running great all the dvds have and rented	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0

the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
sound quality is	1
no matter the format	1
