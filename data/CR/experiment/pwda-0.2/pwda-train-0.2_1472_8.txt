then it sometimes it working the wait a few minutes and system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
so slow useable that is not it for files of any size or back ups	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
the phone book is very user friendly and very good the speakerphone is excellent	1
pros so off i went get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
i am using them and they generally sound good	1
for me is that the dsub from the sub to the control station too short	0

other it than that this thing is great	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
however if speed reliability and power deliver a good signal to transmit home and the ability to connect multiple devices to all parts of a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
sometimes i find it hard to judge if i am actually doing it and turning it by feel alone or not but i am	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
i love love the fact that it a phone is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1

the zen stores data in memory but does not store files nor does it allow files to be opened or programs to be run	0

the labeling of firmware itself is a huge problem and it is clear that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
is large sub woofer	1
indoors picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
while these devices do have decent speakers the volume on such devices is a lot lower than with standard speakers making it difficult to hear some audio	0

setup was very easy	1
however its x the shots setting is acceptable for of i that optical take	1
it may	1
sometimes the system would i would have to then get going again	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
zennx is replaceable battery was in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can never expect much out of a pair of headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the mount is easy to use also easy it the mount is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after of the s	0
the i bought a player because unfortunately ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0

when you put this thing in your pocket you dont even know it is there it is so small and oh so light	1
after hooking the found out thing up i found that time i had it running it would play about half the dvds i had it would only played less than about half of the dvds i put in i of the dvds i put in it	0

the speaker on my car is very functional and i use it a lot it is very audible even with freeway noise	1
the battery life good very lttle time to charge and no songs	0
they are not the same	0
then sorting the files into folders is easy as pie	1
wo i difficult navigation nt necessarily say difficult do i but nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
if you have expectations you will be pleasantly by runs	1
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
i love that is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the software was great as long as account and not a user you account you have a have an adminstrative user account	1
the resolution is very good and the sound quality the colors are bright and even changeable	1

got this for christmas and i have been very happy with it	1
do item nt buy this monitor	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
the only thing like about this do nt i is the cover does suck	0
the only minor nits i have it is fairly looking it a wrist strap instead of neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
i am not sure while i like the the fact that it has a camera on top performance of the phone in every regard am satisfied with i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
in the hands of nt someone who does it mode yield good results on idiot program auto will	1
it is easy to use and it is free seems feature complete	1
the downside is requires a line of sight	0

do why fixed speaker cable this	0
it was easy to remove the front plate and was only one the could	1
color screen good is	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was turned on	0

speed means fast data transfers	1
this has so many capabilities will be able to will that you ll always have the ability to be ready room for new technologies as they evolve	1
the world volume	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
not is recognize player at random times despite being connected and does player displaying library	0
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i pleased the performance at the low price these sell for on amazon	0
i m giving this player cautious giving recommendation	1

far more difficult to select songs has no easy use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to it nt with contact lists numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i got both	1
the compromised contrast crispness and angles can readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ignored ca nt be beat	0
speakerphone	1

well flash photos a still great and there was never are lot of noise	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1

as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt display the complete filenames of the user s devices and you must cycle through all the buttons before getting them back to normal size	0
it is made of plastic	0
upon looking at these i would like them to be a bit small but having a solid feel to them	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic i think they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the legs he said that would have been better and put some rubber  on the corners	0
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the sound quality is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price of the phone is excellent	1
all aspects does well in it of internet browsing	1
so far the router fine has worked well	1
using wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera pictures transfer included the cable	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1

i that changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
sleep great sound good interface mode good sound quality replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep memory good timers multiple play modes	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
it is to use it seems feature complete	1

i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera and is easy to use and that figure takes too long great pictures yet does nt take would weeks to figure out how to operate	1
canon is better and believe algorithms are also better	1
easy all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
absolutely amazing pictures are the the camera captures the minutest of details	1
it had a and more sturdy casing	0
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
considering the price and specs this might just be the best deal out there for a large memory mp player	1
i like or do nt always does allow for care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
i like it enough to get through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1

the capacity is great for me	1
plays now it still so everything you can just t see it	0
does not recognize is and random times player being connected at displaying player despite library	0

contrary cocking to the shutter the excellent stopaction photos reviewers and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce halfway by to what other position experienced	1

i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
the sound quality of the audio is so bad that it is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
overall i would computer speakers to someone who of a set wants small but effective reccomend these at a reasonable price	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
but i the to rate these speakers on if i giving give a stars my listening needs i would m because i think they do were job that most people want them for	1
too many tracks to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
navigation is easy and i that found syncing files was the player to the computer too easy from	1

my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for s and there is no firmware update support this product	1

no way please feel free to contact their customer service	0
the screen size and ring tones are unlimited	1
some people have problems with the flip player on the bottom cover that the switch releases has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
and if you do well there is no complaints about that	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
it also has excellent coverage is well lit and through our two story house	1
the has the radio function which very useful but is utterly useless	0
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are made of metal they are more sturdy than my old radio	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
and ve does playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time i gaming it been run slower while multi tasking the compromised for me experience is not while	0
i cant believe the size and weight of this little critter	0

uploading to my windows based pc images the is very fast and simple	1
sub woofer is large	1
the fm radio is cool	1

weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it getting nt show of complete you the mp s with really long to filenames must cycle size every back setting before does normal names zoom through	0
the setup process for game the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the the quest player is sub par	0
when you turn on your player the player will turn off and the music will continue to play as you left it when you were last there	1
its silver magnesium finish is image quality is superb its clean with a matte stunning and the sharp lines and excellent any grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1

its far address difficult to it and has playlist easy the use on to fly mention phone such as the new ipod not to no select songs does nt sinc with contact lists creation numbers more books ect like the ipod	0
creative labs says its customer support website is useless	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have sound quality the jbl on stage are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i that feature rrb	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that you do not automatically play one after another in the same game	0
for have money apex machines the good features	1
sound best in class	1
the zennx will be up and running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other consumer electronics appliance	1

the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp that ll entirely about workspace issues	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no way for me to get rid of this product	1
sure than the ipod is by little bigger it but not a much	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1

i no problems had have with the phone	1
the lcd text on the screen was very large and readable	1
much faster single my previous than netbook with acer one processor	1

option i think the option to browse in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
the paint is easily scratched but if you dont like it you should be able to swap it out	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i this a bit find time onscreen displays annoying	0
as a result this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on your needs however it is predecessor the quickly becomes a disappointment	0
this phone game is a winner	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently fast to scroll so i end up pressing enter when want to scroll i meant to scroll	0
despite how small being the than slightly larger ipod i must say i surprised was to see it its was when i unwrapped the box	1
a week out of the hospital and i began to see slight flickering of the screen on my phone growing more frequent each day	0
lastly i feel that flaw  the speakers were over priced for what i paid for them got lrb unless there and i think that is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal a very clear playback	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
no battery stays than for and more takes the a long time charged or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
for the price it investment a well spent is	1
setup it and is simple worked right out of the box	0
it is just such a small light weight non intrusive device which you can take with you anywhere	1
extemely lame is this	0

one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music in	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable service	1
remote you can use and it is much better designed than the s	1
for the money apex machines are have good features	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the battery going and i had trouble the s but s the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
i ve also had  the nomad zen lock up several times	0
best camera function from the image quality can ever i color say almost everything	1
i have on this phone excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i also fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player want to listen to not just the one you made liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you in the browser i also the fact that it is a browser i also the way that it works made on the player want to listen to not just the computer	1
is this player an ideal purchase	1
although the sound quality is good it needs to be more than good enough on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
oh you put it in your pocket you forget it is this phone there is unbelievably small and when so light	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was software the	0
first asthetic cons a tad the not bulky most and looking player the does nt support a folder stucture	0
bass fanatics s	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
price the is very good	1
it wo a nt bought play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and it by feel alone	1
the headphone jack seems to a major	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of the two contrast brightness see and viewing angles	1
over the integrated radio better with the optional headset you can to music listen even	1
even leaving it produces crystal clear playback	1
i think the software is crap	0

overall i would these someone who wants of speakers at	1
there are limitations fact that you can adjust the frequency fact that there are no limits to what you can do with frequency adjustments no limits because of the built in speaker crossovers	0

longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc are the sensibilities	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
to be honest i think this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now makes sense	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile can give as a carrier	0
i tried it and it worked right out of the box	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but not as as when i view them on my	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums from my itunes library	1

i have to jpeg i m also by impressed on cd rs dvds the user interface for playing say mp and mpeg files pretty stored	1
they are very light and perfect to be used along with them	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was made in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
unfortunately on the screen after loading songs all i can see get now is player either not connected or busy	0
my one issue ripping is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the with the mediasource software fails process to populate the year field	0
in all this is a very good for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1

because it help a so take spectacular photos	1
the buttons are small even for my small hands but you get used to them rather quickly they are on the right side	0
it is it	1
is material on the cheap side	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is broken	0
i will definitely would not be inclined to purchase an apex use this as product again	0
overall i like i think it	1
all in all this is a very good deal for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants to upgrade	1
i do nt want to brag too much but this computer is incredible	1
to it the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
was dissapointed that nt more helpful	0
in addition comes it with a sleek and powerful headset	1
having spent a lot of time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays to be	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
otherwise i think this player is awesome	1
the remote works but to sit then stops working it does not work and you are left standing there turn it on thinking you are doing something wrong	0
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
considering might this the price and specs be the best a large memory mp player out there for buy	1
the software on the router is the same pretty good	1
great phone i d buy another	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its simplicity widescreen	1
the price was the lowest i have ever seen in my research lrb best buy office furniture	1
even leaving it on produces crystal clear playback	1

anyways to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of with acer and their terrible service support	0
the has a different type battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery be charged while in the camera charging also you use the plugged without running	0
this is wonderful your first dvd player have for to	1

sound quality is	1
on the positive is pretty good once everything configured	1
so far i have no complaints and i this to anyone wants quality over appearance also wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next	0
other than that this place thing is great	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly in english	1
my first impression was positive	1
zennx other battery options for zennx the battery life was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennz over ipo is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
used it a lot i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack not want to just sort of fizzled out	0
slow gui be prepared to approximately seconds time you change of the sub menu items and that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
the sound quality in the room level is also not as good as i would have expected is also not as high as i would have expected	0
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
it impressed me with disign the specs the price	0
it is weight and a good signal strength	1
there was no	0
all in all this is great is another excellent creative product	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and a small price tag and for most people that is the only downside it is not enoug for most people that is purposes the only downside it is not enough	0
it will just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
i have seen nothing of the problems people have complained and cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a week i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack or scroll wheel will show up with me too in any case	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the pain came	1
about a month ago bought my canon g i and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
the second part of the puzzle is working just fine	1
they have a number of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player and doesnt give you time to recover is awesome it just my heart when i see breaks fast the people which is horrible	1
line did nt work the way was supposed to so we re returning it we this for our two computers	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks stored on the computer are listed individually and is not the same as a playlist are organized by cd in addition which are not listed but are a playlist from the computer can be complicated because the tracks stored on the computer are listed individually and is not the same as a playlist are organized by cd in addition which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical orde organized in alphabetical order	0
possibly the biggest player has is fact that can the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
it anything this phone does does perfectly	1
so slow that it is not taking with a file useable for note files of any size or back ups	0

even slightest of the shakes totally distorts	0
packed and after a lengthy and camera extensive journey search for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because image quality and the fact that it has a of the superior digital picture quality mega pixel	1
i have tried several times to contact apex bank through their on line support site and their telephone line but they are nt answering any of my emails and they telephone line is always busy	0
the player its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down i to turn off and turn it on again which is not my likings	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
i purchased a pair of these glasses for my wife from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0

price gb of storage	1
focusing on a display rack of the same colour about feet away in a taken brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were n blurry and in a shade some cases had a very slight tint of orange	0
when the backlight fails i have to it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
they were both good	1

the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also has a lot of flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual mode	1
the controls are much more complex compared to the simple ipod ones	1
it does make you look pretty spending that kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics to bring it down of course	0

there are as of interesting features such included lots eax and customization	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1

the only two minor issues have with the are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
not is nothing special for but it a bad monitor	1
great works	1
i found using to your songs to the jukebox be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the unit would either not or the song that play skip wildly no matter at all it was resting on my desk	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0

however its x optical setting is zoom acceptable for of the best the shots that i take	1
it has a inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically one after another like on a cd	0

to keep it short a better choice is cheaper and in this my opinion than an ipod	0
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not indicated bad as some reviewers as have	0
i will have to see if i agree with others here about the character of this speaker	0
the computer direct outrageously fast and shipping was processing	0

they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
the sound quality is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is a speaker but i only use it when the display is off in which case you can see you own reflection on the screen	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is when she was in the car it worked as expected even out of doors	1
it can t rate it one star only because does work it i when is pretty good	0
then able to be my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be at all read at all	0
for of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
we and when finding nemo dvd we the tried got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0

of decency he the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
its far more difficult to select songs no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists numbers address books ect like	0

my other big complaint about this monitor is that	0
were the two main factors why i picked the nomad	1
this has so many for that evolve ll always have room you new technologies as they capabilities	0
the end of the day what i wanted a large capacity player which allows me to easily any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1

it is tall so i ended up putting it on top	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
overall the g dynamic range point delivers what must be in terms of image quality considered the best image quality of any current  megapixel digicams from a sharpness point of view as well as a tonal balance and color response poin detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1

my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean smile light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1

it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking pictures in low light but it does not allow the camera to focus in low traffic	0

they are very sturdy and have no trouble at all when carrying or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
it takes a while for it to come back online lrb i have nt heard of it rrb which does nt sound bad until you get nailed twice in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
mid loud enough to get your music out the bass range is nt the best but to your music this is a good option for it is certainly there and enough to response satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0

i	1

i have not had to deal with any of the usual problems with digital cameras so i am very pleased	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to in the which somewhat a disappointment	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software that comes bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
i d venture to say that because it is low cost it set out there costwise	0
this phone is one of the few in the world that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
in suck i would invest headphones it since some cool ones has the eax feature	0
the main problem for me is that the transition from the sub to the control panel is too short	0
i am very happy with the jbl n ii as well which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the as was great as long software you have an adminstrative user account	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged the company isn and can t keep up with keep demands	0

about service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive of you customer the quality tells their products and their stand to willingness behind them	0
i immediately had to getting the player problems recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
beautiful home theater and music mids and respectable bass	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost any dvd you throw at it	1
i m very happy with these am very happy with these i ll probably will probably buy more for the front and back buy morefor the front bac i ll probably will probably buy more for the front and back buy more for the front channels	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
if you do can artist tags all of your tracks and lump it not the same directory ll they nt into be searched via have or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
it is sound quality small light and nice looking and the display a very is decent as well	1
the final insult is that while the printer comes with useful software to make sharing printers a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then it is an additional to the cost of the printer to use	1
after nearly pictures i a year of using it have found that it is a great camera and this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
the auto settings available setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for dont want to use the want to have the those who want settings available them	1
the phone book very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
listed complicated playlists from organized can be making because the tracks the computer finally individually and are organized by cd which are not listed are but are in alphabetical order	0
i love these machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
very simple to use	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality great hd size and price make it a great value for money buy	1

i checked out the worked reviews amazon i m pleased to say mine fine works and right out of the box	1
overall small sounds great and but not as good as less expensive than better than apple is overpriced ipod	1
one that plus is other napster now via this device supports their software	0
take a look at the s pii	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers the best solution	1
so far have not problems with dvds not being able to play	1

i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
it has very good much better the linksys router it replaced	1

it really impressed me with the quality and the price	1
the device itself is pretty good	1
unlike some of the other people who a lemon came in perfect working condition	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only  so of the screen are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must right th cycle through every zoom setting before names the zoom settings ar so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must right th cycle through every zoom setting before names the zoom settings are not adjustable so you must right th cycle through ever getting the zoom settings back to normal size	0
