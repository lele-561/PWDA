this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
i get to chapter and it everything freezes	0
i try  navigating using back to the main menu and the player could have tried is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
i pretty good job use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
yes the picture quality price is high but the and features which are too numerous to is very good and yes the features mention while are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1

can be used to the eax features are pretty cool as well as  creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for features that can be used for audio features that for example compensate for features that can be used for audio the extraneous noise added encountered in a car or on the extraneous noise added encountered in a car or on a train	1
lack of bass which i have my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
audio is the quality excellent	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
also when the screen is too big the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0

i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
my only complaint is that the cord the problem is not long enough	0
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and a small price tag and for most people that is the only downside it is not enoug for most people that is purposes the only downside it is not enough	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the speakers are nice no question would about it this size the sound of this size is good for the size the range is what you might expect the bass is very good for he speakers the bass even better tha from speakers this size lrb perhaps he speakers the bass even better than expected rrb	1
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
etter and i think canon is optics i can see that they are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
the resolution is very good and the sound quality the colors are bright and even changeable	1
storage capacity	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software that comes bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1

equipment included is average but that not included in the price is nt a big deal since that s not need need what you are buying it for	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
all nice and compact	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
say that in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
weaknesses are minor not show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoo the feel and layout of the remote  control setting before gettin back to norma are only   so so it does nt show the complete  filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting range of the screen the screen is full of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before gettin back to normal size	0
as much all the time it stands now the case for a trip is in one place pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all in the car your songs beforehand	0
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is like this that it now makes more sense to use uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that of a difference it not does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1

the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
i expected the x digital zoom very clear and very to be grainy but onfull size high images to be to quite clear and the quality is fine quality the zoomed images are very clear sharp and very quite impressive	1
but it works very the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i tried to contact the called apex cust service no help	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
and well made all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
