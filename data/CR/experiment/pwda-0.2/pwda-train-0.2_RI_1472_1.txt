they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0

loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0

it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
however once you crank the volume a little to up to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to music like a violin or viola the audio is great a very good speaker for the price an get done with some background musi a  level a bit too distracting get done with some background musi a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to music like a violin or viola the audio is great a very good speaker for the price an lrb well for the work i like to music like a violin or viola the audio is great a very good speaker for the price an  get done with some background  music viola the audio is great a very good speaker for the price an lrb well  this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1

kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward guess but boring i can deal with that	0
usb means for fast data transfers	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0

it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
like other reviewers the installation was hell	0

pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
the features are nice i really cool like the radio	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been for myself extremely impressed since receiving and i have already used happy with it for myself it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1

all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
this good means that there is a good chance that this phone will good good not break easily like typical american phones	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
otherwise this player is is awesome	1

for the price and features it is really good	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
these speakers have great leave sound the sound on mode but they will buzz if you leave them on with the volume sound turned up	0

navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
my my computer jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as on my phone when they are i view them on my monitor	0

months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0

it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
it does not interfere well in all aspects of internet browsing	0
its far heavier does not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocke and much larger which might not seem at first but if you have a small one you could carryin your pocke to matter except if you h you could carryin your pocket or keep doe use it while running or keep does it in your pocket	0
it worked perfectly for about really well a week then pain the problems came	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
both units are small with arms similarly small speakers	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
with the mouse it will only move the monitor side to side lrb be able to move no up down or tilt feature rrb	0

great sound very long  battery great sound great life very fast recharges rate great battery life great removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
the read screen is see what you are looking at very easy to read and the blue dim light is bright  enough to read at night light is bright enough so you can see what you are looking at very easy to read and the blue dim light be bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too lon but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
i am quite quite well happy having over gigs of music stored in the music folder on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
you re market is going to going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones crash and you are going suck	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
i would not be inclined to will definitely purchase an apex able product again	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
i spent hours spent a couple of hours on that and i could nt connect to the interne on that and i could nt spent connect to the internet	0
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
i have not played with all the features yet it get the hang of it and but the camera is easy to use once you i can tell you that it get used to it	1

i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
nice machines low right but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
i will have when they complain to wholeheartedly agree with others here agree about the quality of this speaker	0
first the cons a tad bulky but not the best not the most higher than the pros asthetic looking player and does nt support a one of folder stucture	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was the app anything but easy to use	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1

enough the first routers worked good for years	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0

the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
anyways the last few days but i ve had enough back to the point i ve tried to be so way of treating me and calm over the past month been able of dealing with acer and but i have had enough their terrible service and support	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why quality of the i picked i think this the nomad	1
you can do what you want with it such of music you want to play or instead as choose what kind the type of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classica other different things with it such of music you want to play or instead as choose what kind the type of now playing interface you can old see the interface as modern or classical	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
the windows premium is good windows is good lrb do nt recommend not starter rrb and user friendly	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
i was with it impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three for a week and was entertained hours and then it died	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the up i tour pop speaker on the i was sold	1
name user replaceable battery	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
this is one of have the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever seen owned	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
update jan apple says the device has worked flawlessly for the past yea the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
if you re looking are for bluetooth a quality tower speaker this is it	1
her response delivery was prompt	1
the fm radio station is cool	1
this is what you need wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
i dont highly recommend a nokia	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
it would just spin a message up and will stop and display no disc	0
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
i give it a rating of stars couple for looks	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
excellent battery life hours what beats ipod is	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots in the same way it that are not going to the game but not be in a regular setting	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
guitar a bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
i tried called response apex cust service no help	0
the device itself is good pretty solid	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
software development is easy to use	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it came back working and things was like i was in a dream and things i was momentarily glad that the rumors i turn d heard about acer tech support did nt acer temp support was there but then i turnd around and everything i had heard abou i was momentarily glad that the rumors i turn d heard about acer tech support did nt acer tech support was there but then i turn d around and everything i had heard about acers tech support did nt turn out to be true in my cas turn out to be true in my case	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
recently bought  this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i detail and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr model happily found that qualities of the picture are card as expected i found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m camera along with pixel fine detail and many of the user friendly functions are very similar t excellent with m m  camera along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine detail and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr model happily found tha pixel fine y similar to slr mode combos and many purchased this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m camera along with pixel fine detail and many of the user friendly function of the user  friendly functions are very   similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
bright vivid clean lines wide good contrast viewing angle and best of all great price	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
technology it is the case of and more expensive small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used of the fact that a in the same the zx	1
the build very solid quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while sound quality is playing discs and the picture and sound is top feel like it is going to crack notch	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
its silver magnesium finish ofocus and excellent grip make it easy to use the quality of the images are better than any other camera i ve see is used stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip ail of the images are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
setup software software for found my application i found found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
only thing that causes the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station too short is too short	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with far so not wrong digital pictures so hopeful i am very pleased	1
the only drawback problem is the speaker wire is very thin	0
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
good battery life	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
when the radio player was working it was great but	0
the bottom line is that this is an excellent game enjoy all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
this is i have used and the best by far the finest camera i have seen in its price and category i have ever used	1
maybe like this to be it is my lack of experience but i find the quality of my found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
the eax of sound enhancement of feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band work with the custom eq eq	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
the first routers worked good for years	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
in may mean addition it comes with a remote control	1
well excellent range of metering options as well	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
so a good deal besides the annoyances this a very good deal is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
sound is crystal clear very good and the bass is very deep as well	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is saying that i think pretty so good	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software that comes bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
i couple of months have it for a couple of weeks week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
be a bit slow p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and does nt not always seems to respond but it may be just operator error	0
this machine computer is and how will change your whole idea of what a laptop should life and your be	1
i also did  nt like the way it displayed information way on the screen when you zoomed down into the screenwhen you are in zoom mod did nt like the way it displayed information way on the screen when you zoomed down into the screenwhen you are in zoom modei did not likethe way it showed information wayon the screen as you zoom down int down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
they will not respond to my emails always and the phone answer the phone line is constantly busy	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
made out of metal and plastic like but seems pretty sturdythe phone is kind of made out a meta here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of made out of metal and plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
price gb per gigabyte of storage	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it was just there it was just intuitive	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
takes excellent photos	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
they are not wowable good	0
i have had this player for months and have trying to get been able not being able to get to the dvd see a total of dvd lack of interest in this player and this is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player t is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
player has a problem alias alias not available with dual layer dvd is the following season by such as alias season and season	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
very easy simple to use	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited just limited to the very low and zen it quality applies to all the company is products	0
the price performance looked just right	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
the used for has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
d link does not atible with the adapter provide mac support for the adapter however i was party able to mac adapter that is find a free third not party driver that is compatible	0
i bought this slick phone and loving it i am very happy with it	1
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
my first impression was text fitch rating positive	1
unit failed and worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
longer battery life greater the internet and pc compatibility are the main goals accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
second the automatic sync on creative lets you preview the quality of review  the songs before it begins its transfer	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans high prices and and to another carrier is horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
speakerphone	1
the first night i had it next to me when i to my bed went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy wit got this phone  i put  it next to me when i to my bed went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and next to me when i to my bed went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy wit the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy  with it	0
this is an excellent value	1
since it would not work as advertised i i tried it and called did support	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are other issues the lens cap and the lens itself	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
although lastly i feel that the speakers were over i have to say priced for what i got lrb unless am not aware of would say there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
how easy to hook up	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
i did buy the notmad software a week or so ago ago and found that a vast improvement	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
for a week i ve now in my hand had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
some of the t is which does not work the entire route or for along several long stretches on that same route	1
they sound really good just as the say reviews say	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
it is easy for beginners to use but tool for a beginner has features start with experienced that more serious photographers will love so it easy is an excellent camera to grow into	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
the size is small	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
you can a special number also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
of the memory is staggering	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
short this model router has now failed me twice in the short ive had it span of time mentioned	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
hooked down up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
harmon international has done sound quality is very good it a great job on done a great job on all of these equipment the sound quality is very good it a great do a great done all of this equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarit all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
fm receiver says it has none	0
life is battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
x zoom zoom is nice	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
the manual does may arise  a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
the is that its easy for unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shot catch with the canon g camera is that its make it easy for unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
is very easy to use the color screen makes this free after rebates and easy to set upgoogle phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
bright visible light screen	1
it is sound quality small light and nice looking and the display a very is decent as well	1
forget about the sleek looks if it be done with can t play some be done without of your real dvds	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i great battery life and performance love would definitely recommend this phone	1
even the new apple music app where your favorite music better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
also for some reason the a lot of noise and picture looks washed out on s video with of noise and noise lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
i m sure it would and can be useful be useful if you set room but the in a different setting one where quiet you will be fine am not would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
i just purchased this player say that i love i and i have to say that i say love it	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1

all of no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians people for that thank had because i gave all the information i could	0
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the software has nt for me been a hassle for me at all	1
ooh and i dropped this is my little camera and i dropped it and it didnt fall off but it still still works fine this little camera has so many features i have not been able to get nt even gotten to all of them ye it and it didnt fall off but it still still works fine this little camera has so many features i have close been able to get nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
second gripe in weve had the review is that in the or of units some of the units so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have after already been returned for repair or replacement	0
others may have better luck but i have screens never h such a bad seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low high volume the ones that are and at the end of the day low volumes they tend to be sound a little weak	0
the screen is large and easily read	1
ring tones only  come with crazy songs a few different rings and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
and man i had to work to put all the songs my chinese songs on go back to my computer the player because i had then the actual the list chinese names of the songs as the title	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter hard adjustment dial its very small and hard reading to turn so you it to make can little t get little an accurate adjustment	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature every site but not on this player	0
me this product is too fragile for normal use	0
too small the storage capacity is great for me	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
the interface used could be better to designed	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g looking to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there a reasonable price is no better camera out there dslr to anyone period	1
great to have when it works through two of them its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
it also also has unproven battery life	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
the end of i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and tried it would nt do it	0

but he canon never fails to amaze	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for features those who a lot of features features for those who are looking are serious stated about photography	1
my gut save files and at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to bu tells me the  nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit ry expensive lesson in companies never to bu one on which i can t create folders or end result of this at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to  buy products from again	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
then my dvds would the background and the would just stop playing or not even be read at al stop playing in go to sleep the would just middle or not even be read at all	0
you ll be changing track information you ll be listening to a lot of music the music a on the cd lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is cd maker mediocre at best	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
great color display sharp picture you and just the right size for my desk	1
creating playlists using the included create a playlist software to minimize issue was nt as easy as music i would have liked	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear a lot of spent i find onscreen displays annoying	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
works out super easy	1
it despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i i expected it to be is a very small ipod despite unwrapped have i have to the box	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
lots of flaws but exceptional  sound quality hd quality great battery life great size and price make it a good buy	1
i find find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the the subject indoor shots are very good provided that are very good your subject the results is no more than about feet away	1

people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
it first but then worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio also which the is a very good speaker and is a nice feature when you are bored	1
the macro the macro lens works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
so far the router has worked well	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1

it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
there is no speaker grill bumper or on the front to offer any protection to the driver	0
the more i work with it the more the more i love it	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the auto focus performs well but i love like to use the camera having want the optional scene modes they are dummy proof would recommend and the camera correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to like to be able to use it and i seek t use the camera	0
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1

multiple play modes tracks in order it is worth of album shuffle etc is the jukebox standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra which is a jukebox that plays songs in order it is worth of album shuffle etc etc but worth noting that the zen xxtra is not deficient in this matte the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1

i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
very simple to use	1

great price	1
this camera use was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1

the larger screen has my own take photos allowed me to put all my photos on it do a lot more with lrb could nt on the dell rrb and take photos and put them edit them	0
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0

mid to high end in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this looking for to anyone wanting a high quality so point and shoot camera in the medium not hesitate to price range	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the usb port the m logo on the back is a nice feature	1
sound quality station and base is amazing	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
very you a lot of light and it i can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with  the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful very if focus mode that would be really helpful very if shooting a scene that is wit shooting a scene that is with a camera tough to automatically focus	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
equipment big looking for included is average but that is looking for nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not it is a pocket protector that is bother you	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
i needed three batteries to  use two or keep s myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
like the g looks like a work of art	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
great quality picture and of life features	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i can already tell that am going to miss it i am disapointed	0
for the price there is when nothing better	1

blank the screen is large and easily read	0
no use it games it has a big cool screen why not use it	0
i started accessing data from my laptop it to my phone only and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and delivers on this product one i was also looking for performance it delivers both	1
however i do nt carry it on my belt shoulder at all because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip of the case and the clip can slip off and the strap on the side of the bag ca like to carry it on my belt shoulder at all because the clip is nt secure and i nt like to carry it on my belt shoulder at all because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip of the case can slip off	0
in fact each of same time and my creative mp players had software problem in the same idea the first place	0
the interface was and some of the atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard headphone jack instead of a mm other features headset jack	0
so far i have no complaints and i recommend save a lot of money for is looking for this to anyone  who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to listen to mp s over the internet and also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants t to be able to listen to mp nothing	0

in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
it does it is made of nt smell like burning plastic when you open plastic it smells like the drive	1
the front cover can pop off it easily but i always have mine in the case so i did dont nt if you are not careful notice after first day	0

definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
does not provide enough volume headphones with built in when connected power supplies to larger headphones or external receivers	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it for it was supposed to knowing it was going to work so we re returning it we bought this not router for our two computers	0

all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
it is smaller much smaller than i expected and for than is the world the smaller what i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
things the colors are much more distinct and i a i do nt trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor have to strain my ky old eyes and squint laptop when  i love this monitor it is so much brighter the colors are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my ky old eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1

it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
my wife is with it due even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
so in the background now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
they do look cool in the dark video though	0
deficiencies the addition of third with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones easy to and software	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
in addition it weren t charged properly if you have any problems only seems to work if you re about  it five feet away happen from the player although that may have been just the batteries that only seems to work if you re about it five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with i came with it	0

overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
my first impression was positive	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was easy was a breeze	0

from the speakers so if you want to get a bigger sound you would need a hug the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not a bigger speaker than a subwoofer but there is a lot of thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
