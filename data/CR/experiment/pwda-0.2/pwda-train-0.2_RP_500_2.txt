when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
i think this thing is great	1

the image quality is poor	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1

because it can make a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1

the more i work with it the more i love it	1
like it is predecessor the recently revised nx this player boasts a good balance between size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes songs based on id tags and excellent sound	1
this router is the best router i have used to date	1
the screen is bright easy to read in the dark and in the daylight with nice colors	1
i am sure this unit will have many uses in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be a good one since creative will only warrant it for a few years which in itself is a good thing	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1

the zen xtra sounds great with a good mix and well recored mp s	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play a decent amount of everything you throw at it	1
however a phone call to the customer service line was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process of contacting the company	1
p s it does seem to get confused at times and its a bit annoying but it may be just operator error	0
the apex has been a steady source of inspiration for me	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
the red light is bright and the blue light is dim the red is bright enough to read a book but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd files and i have a lot of files	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1

the standard battery include with the phone is a mah battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
i bought this slick new laptop and i am very happy with it	1
they are very easy to use and have no trouble with volume wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
this camera can be set on auto or in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
the price performance of	1
the screen is larger than the previous model the screen is brighter and has a blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the is green backlight did	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
but anyway the other thing you should take a look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is not very intuitive and does not work very well	0
keep your fingers on the keys	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy construction	0

no problems with reception of signals unlike the previous system it replaced which only lasted months	1

the second part of the puzzle is working just fine	1
reviews for sound quality are generally very positive	1
at the moment it is pretty light but not as light as the sun	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
also it was only with one and a half players so overall it is a decent game	1
the nikon coolpix is one of the best cameras to use high quality and compact in size	1
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
i chose this camera because of its ability to shoot for very high quality clean images	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and they will tell you about the quality of their products and their willingness to help you	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
c i do love the new music player which has a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
these are great portable speakers for when you are cycling in the park	1
also the head cap design is flawed	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent place to start but not on this player	0
my husband was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
the support was very helpful and helpfull once you actually got someone	1

it is nt play of my movies which are all in the boughten	0

but this is not documented in the zen manual neither in the book nor online	0
speaker speakersa home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined by high end treble and respectable bass	1
halfway through the first upgrade progress bar the infamous not found screen pops up and most of the time there is interface	0
i thought the game was decent enough it was nt complicated to get into at all	1
i am able to carry it on my person and in places where other weapons are not so easily concealed	1
easy to hook up	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
now heres the stuff you should know about this phone to go with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect its fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use and	1
it would just spin up and stop and there would be no disc	0
i got this thing for my birthday and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl speakers and are much more powerful they can be used with any headphones i love that feature rrb	1

because it can be used as a so so to take spectacular photos	0

with a simple interface the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1

this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
battery life is limited because i use it every day and i have to charge it every night	0
it would have been a lot nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the screen did not cover up the screen	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device you can only buy the music you need for your music collection	0
i started accessing and transfering files to my computer and uploaded it to github	0
i love this player and am very happy with my decision	1
very long lasting battery life	1

my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
uploading the files from my pc to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
this product is definitely worth it	1

with the smooth knob i can turn it without having to judge if i am actually turning it and turning it by feel alone	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works very well for me but many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1

the sounds were as the music directors intended	1
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0

a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
speaker joints excellent with a smooth finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1

having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
with it enabled anytime we made a connection to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would not work	0
it is a great device if you are travelling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0

cons i think the satellites will be ugly	0
have used it frequently and have enjoyed it	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
huge amount of music i loaded my entire collection of music which is so huge that you can listen to all songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
i tried it as bunch of different formats to see if it would work and it did	1
games kind of stink and you dont like them so you have to pay to get additional games	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
i give my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier why i dont know	0
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed down to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0

the sound is pretty good for the price although not anything like a surround system and there is some distortion but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you can see you own reflection on the screen	0

the screen quality is very high and the color is very sharp clear	1
in fact i would say not bright enough	0
speakerphone	1
add the player to your computer open up your library and you can listen to your stored mp s as they come in enjoy	1
this product is not available at any price	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
multiple play modes with different songs in order of popularity etc is standard on all jukebox games but worth noting that the zen mode is not deficient in this regard	1
works out	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more value from a cheep pair of shoes	1
it would look great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other issues	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
it is a bit bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not the same technology that is used in the zx	1
other then that it is very good for the price	1
they have a number of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt about it and if you want to buy a good product these random disconnects kills it for you	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
only con i foto there is no camera	0
the alarm on the phone goes off when you are not there and there is no way to change this	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1

the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
the scene mode will work well for the remainder of the players that are not going to be in the game	1
they do look pretty good in the dark though	0
the colors and everything else	1
i found that it was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than what i had been using for years	0

this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1

android is good with a wide array of features built into it	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give them stars but i am not going to because i dont think they do the job that most people want them for	0
the only downside is the remote which is a bit out of sight	0
this has happened with several things we dont know what the dvd is and sometimes if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work the day before	0
the display is very good and the text rendering is good enough that you can forget entirely about workspace issues	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
so it was useless and ugly as with all software bundled with it it was unusable	0
please feel free to contact their customer service	1
instead	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
the only things i have to complain about is that the book is hard to read in daylight but i guess everyone elses is too	0
our special friends at creative studio have given this thing good sound quality great features for the price long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
does not provide enough volume when compared to larger receivers or external receivers	0
billy joel was right on the money when he said you get more mileage from a good pair of speakers	1
it seems to me that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their ability to stand behind them	0
the price performance looked just right	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my purchase	1
trumps instincts are razor sharp even in	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
harmon international has done a very good job on all of these equipment and it produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
in a world where others say not bright enough	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been pressed for a few seconds	0
they were both good	1
and so far there is no complaints about that	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
the use of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that this is not the case in this matter it is used in the following ways	0
the monitor works well with a sharp and clear display	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you can throw at it	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean i hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and it works fine	1
it may	1
the design and construction of the nikon optics are outstanding as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
so far i really like it and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality music for cheap and anyone who is looking for a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
when i put it to the test for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker still worked and it was even out of doors	1
however as with all built in flashes in digital cameras you get the same issue with depth being lost	0
please a firmware update that enables all the applications that are connected to this wireless router to be accessible in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to use it to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
the other day when i was trying to get it locked up and will not do it now	0
very convenient to scroll in menu bar	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
this is by far the best in its price and category i have ever used	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms can be used to bring you just that much closer	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the results	1
the only thing i am not happy with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times etc etc	0
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
so sit back relax and brag to your friends who paid a lot of money for a player that can t do half the things this guy can and for a fraction of the money	1
this is a good one i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to a good song rather than heavy metal no problem	1
the power off option can be turned off easily by pressing the power button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1

the combination of the price storage size and player performance makes this player the best on the market	1

the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
this thing is awesome	1

the router i bought today lrb and rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0

the interface used to be better designed	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
i m very happy with these i ll probably make more of them	1
but about of dvd is i cant get the picture to play on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and then the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
the problem is that everything and anything has connected to it has been around for a long time even when in the same room	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
i am very interested in the future of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i ordered it on a site called lrb around the same time and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was here in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
player is great and looks great if you can get the dvd version	1
i quickly got used to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast and easily	1
halfway through the router upgrade progress bar the infamous router is not found it has been replaced most of the router is interface	0
this is extemely lame	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
the door closed	1
key words	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up things on my countertop and then to listen to music	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
i will never use this machine againwhat this machine is capable of	1
this is a great piece of work for a great price and it is worth every penny	1
the best at an incredible price	1
something tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive with no one on it so i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies not being able to be trusted to	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
the sound quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
very convenient to work from etc	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
the good news is that the unit has both coax and coaxial audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the brochure i d scanned before buying	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
samsung galaxy s has a system error problem days after purchase	0
i can see a big difference between the dsl and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
i am really impressed by this	1
naturally i did quite a bit of research before buying this one and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth adapter	1
despite most reviewers giving a thumbs up to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using it	0
the colors and everything are great	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
it is another great misfortune that my laptop i use to operate crashes frequently and my music player set up does nt work with it s the list goes on and on	0
this is so lame	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
the controls are a little harder to get used to than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and i at the beginning did not think they would be enough to justify the huge difference in price	0
however my hard work has paid off and i have not dropped it once	0
the problem is much larger	0
the problem is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
the bottom line is for the most part these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
this thing is trash	0
great value great investment	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work properly	0
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
getting access to the device is so easy	1
in fact it caused my phone to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and replaced it with mediasource	0
contrary to what you might think the g does sync at of course with third party flashes just as it does with the g from canon	1
i have this connected to my pc and it works flawlessly	1
i love you and i tell everyone	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the problem is that the fact that anything has connected to it has been around for so long that it s even when in the same room	0
naturally i did some research before purchasing and i found that wise zens are unbeatable	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
when i put it to use for my work it is very quiet in the office and the speaker has worked as expected even out of doors	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
first the zen lets you sync with your friends	1
i will definitely not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
over all a great experience with a very compact camera which made us take our photography on a totally new level	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
great sound quality good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers good	1
it would have been nice if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the screen did nt show up on the screen	0
i made this a few years ago for a project and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	1
this app is good with a huge array of apps and games built into it	1
i have tried to play the song three times with no success	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your hand	1

i called it a scam and will be sending this awful deceptive product back https www amazon com gp product b a b b ref sr ie utf	0

no dropouts good signal strength all over my three rooms in my house lrb unit is very easy to use and easy in the setup and security aspects	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
however the wifi on this new router worked of the time	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
it will just spin up and down and display no disc	0
best in class performance	1
i had it fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the investment	1
i am sure this unit will have problems in the future and the no charge no questions asked replacement warranty will be of no use since it will only warrant it for days which in itself is a problem	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
i found it easy to use to the interface and can find any song i want etc fast enough	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made me experience photography on a totally new level	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i have better speakers on my laptop i think they are better at least to my ears rrb for the cost	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you not buy it	1
i was entertained by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it was over	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
cons i think the satellites will be ugly	0
i can see a big difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
overall a sweet machine	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
i have been using xp for a while now and when installing the enclosed driver i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
please make a plugin that enables all the usb drives attached to this site to be able to be accessed in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be ableto drag and drop files upload attach etc	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0

this machine will change your whole idea of what a computer can do	1

first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
finally i give my thumbs down rating for t mobile as well	0
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as it could be	1
i did not think the eq would do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see how it works	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always use it so i did nt worry about it after all	1
this is a winner	1
paid more than what amazon is charging and they are selling this router at a price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and amazon are trying to get a good quality product these random disconnects are making it impossible	0
the app also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
the sound quality is very good except for the fact that it gets a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
this did nt bother me too much because it wasnt my fault	1
ripping your phone off and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the progressive scan feature can be turned on and off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the most intuitive remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
user replaceable battery	1
so yes as with all software that was released it was useless and ugly	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
they have a whole bunch of them in the us that all have the same sounding name	0
best in class sound	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0

i think i like the unit	1

i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other people are not so comfortable with it	1
having unfilled i d tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
it is like when it randomly comes back from the dead and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often and its really annoying	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
the lg g has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are plenty of other features to keep up with things that you need this phone to do	1
i found the system very intuitive and learned how to use it quickly	1
i would not recommend this product to anyone	0
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
the speakers perform very well and with the addition of the subwoofer the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1

the speaker phone is very functional and i can use it in the car very audible even with the windows down	1

finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
the nikon coolpix is an easy to use high quality and compact in size camera	1

for those who want to buy an ipod just to say you have one and do nt use it this is a much better option plus you can store all your data on it which is a plus for all you music lovers	1
i have been disappointed to see that there is no printed instructions with it just a link to the website with an instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
door closed after a month	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
the sounds were as the movie directors wanted them	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems to be down resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
as a result this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on your needs however it is predecessor the quickly becomes a disappointment	0
