the infrared is a great feature if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to the new one it saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1

this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people you know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the may not know ipod ipod without first removing without the skin	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
i think the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1

the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
one downside though is that work does is autofocus well when battery not low	1

technical support line the support line on the other hand was very helpful technical support linethe support lineon the other	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch properly among nt working on the bottom making it city forecasts to select was impossible in my area	0

within a year i think there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
at the end of the day what i was looking for was a large capacity player which would allow me to take with me any game from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily	1
i sent my monitor in to be repaired for free for such a long time and still have the problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0

if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs would give a stars but i m giving because i think do the job people them for	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery suggests this company is scrambling to put out fires	0

i m very happy with these i ll be ordering a few more for the front channels	1
for a small portable unit allows you to listen to as well ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1

now that i own it and love it have it i miss it however i can t imagine being without it	1
in any case it is by artist so it is ok but i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
feel cheap is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would survive drop	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all of metrics	0
the apex has been a steady performer this year for me	1
the memory is staggering	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction product support of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback problems with the headphone jack	0
you assign also special rings and graphics can to special people when they call	1
and with transferring usb music to your player is incredibly easy	1
well on keypad	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will  very happy with it except in six months it will cost half of what i paid took but that is the price for what i believe to be a chance state of the ar cost half of what i paid took but that is the price for current be a chance state of the art	1
the sound level is also liked not high as high as i would have expected	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best best digital camera i have ever used available under	1
the sound quality is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
i m very with these i ll probably more for the front channels	1
however times the main reason i am not satisfied too happy with this product is the fact that times it will times lock up at odd times	0
with zen xtra sounds great the good headphone and well recored mp s	1
the catch with the gopro camera is that its unresponsiveness will make it easy for you to miss precious shots	0
the rate are very good	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack i think it was for i dont know about me and many others	0
get it every penny is woth it	1
chic look and good build quality and comes with a metal face plate	1
large files found it very useful for transferring i to another computer	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
both the speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
the interface could be better designed used	0
in fact to more times my system it hang caused than not so i uninstalled it mediasource stuck with and	0
minor complaints even though the id tag on the player sorted music is the music option to search for via contained in a folder is unavailable	0
had xmass and love it	1
bottom line it we bought work the way it was supposed to so for re returning it did nt this router we our two computers	0
as it stands now pretty much useless the case is pretty useless unless you re gear in the case packing the player up for travel or if gear on the case you load up all your songs unless you re gear in the case packing the player up for travel or if gear on the case you load up all your songs beforehand as it stands right now is pretty useles beforehand	0
the difference is much larger	1
of plastic is made it	0
use it if you it is a fun little gadget do not nt expect high definition sound	0
hooked it worked weight like great picture bright colors and very light a charm	1
the battery is nice	1
the zooming lever is shaky it does not operate ll feel uneasy	0
considering the price and specs this seems to be the best deal out there for a large memory mp player	1
lens built quality and lens	1

when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	0

zoom takes zoom digital as good of pictures as the optical the does	1
be i think it prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
but i cant do anything i m not very happy with this good machine or acer	0
although the nokia is a little to on the features department doing is an outstanding short of hardware for what it it primarily was meant to do piece be a wireless telephone	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
the windows premium is good but i do nt recommend starter rrb and it is not user friendly	0
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the the best feature that this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid this device has is not the fact of the battery himself or herself but the feature that it has is that th herself b battery him the best feature that this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid this device has is not the fact of the battery himself or herself but the feature that it has is that th herself by opening the lid this device has is the fact that the user can replace the battery himself or herself by opening the lid and popping in the new batter and popping in  the new battery	1
for most reviewers giving kudos to the zen music despite quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
the speakers have a rich sound and good bass obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1

the has function which utterly useless	0
is except maybe a tad too quiet at times when are quieter talkers on the other end	0
silverish color it really adds a special touch	1

however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
no option caller i pictures or individualized ringtones	0
at least i dealt with this as mbps was still a problem	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1

there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
what i do nt like lost is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0

the rate plans are also very good as well	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than the tv remote	0
after it for about a month i unequivocably that this nikon delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and bass	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
it is the most bang for out there	1
this router is awesom but will only you can get more than a open nat type are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried to get it working right but bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1

the backlight will periodically go out the first time it happened i sent it in for a repair	0
feedback on creative is product support this is not limited the zen it to all the company is products	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed buy to me and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
all the company on creative is product support is universally poor this is limited to to the zen it applies not feedback is products	0
fix all the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if it also there are any	1

other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard headphone jack instead of a mm other features headset jack	0
this is a great phone especially for the price with features that are comparable to and better than the ipod	1

those you are looking want the sound that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a phone speaker rrb this is probably necessar for for those who well but for those who are looking want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
it does tend to and should given of room circulation	0
my alarm goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change thi the backlight on the way phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
the standard battery what they dont include day long with the g that comes is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all is the battery that comes day without worrying about charging	1
like the g looks like a work of art	1
the dvd link to the player does not work properly	0
i am sure this unit will have many uses in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be a good one since creative will only warrant it for a few years which in itself is a good thing	1
comes out the matrox g one dvi purchasing when i ll consider card dual more of these super displays	1
of field flash flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the zen stores data files but does not to nor allow it does from to be launched or programs allow a folder structure be opened documents its disk	0

the case to too small get took me like a half hour just to in this monstrosity is fit it its cage	0
i find it depressing too bright	0
finally reiterate my thumbs down for t mobile as a carrier	0
will find full auto setting will give them right out of the box	1
reasonable it has good color and price was great	1
the feel and layout of the remote control only so so it does show the complete filenames of mp with really long names you cycle through every before back to normal size	0
i just started playing this player and i have to say that i really like it	1
even after a bit hard reading some of the instructions it is still a bit difficult hard to figure out	0
the nomad about my favorite thing is the eax feature	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i the look of like think i like it	1
small light is the phone and very attractive	1
etter and i think canon is optics i can see that they are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
i fully expect it to be bad again in the same or similar way to the first one because as many people have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
i bought this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the price	1
the only minor nits i have with strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between strap to hold it in place and it and it need a wris  the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead and it need of a neck strap and it and it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between strap to hold it in place is a bit slow between strap to hold it shots	0
the scene mode works really well for the kind of things that are not going to be in a regular setting	1

even a little weak the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
with this mp player you get a lot more memory for much less than an ipod	1
my other big complaint about it is the stand	0
it have been much nicer had a window so could see the screen if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
looked normal fill a great job converting the letterbox to did of the image and the screen still the aff feature	0
this is a nice feature i recommend if it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening music with no distractions	1
it have a usb port you so can plug in a usb powered drive and has network accessible storage	1
now heres the stuff you should know with the screen is really big and the blue light in the back perfect fast as hell in are easy to use great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton deals on here	1

your site has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
the shine screen makes rebates free after this responsive color bright and commands are very phone	0
i have the manual to try yet all of are adjustment options shutter and aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls priority well thought out and the using is relatively clear	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
i recommend unreservedly the i g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera and i think there is no better camera out there period	1
the sound quality sound is very exceptable	1
but after days the sound worked working the video quit but	0

for the right reason for the right reasons nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere can something that for withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
but should the only thing you anyway does look at here is that fact the the phone really have voice dialing	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on available on this page this player	0
the pictures come a moment hazy entire your hands shake even taking out during the if process of for a picture	0
i think it too bright	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for free in the box is mind blowing	1
about of the time it can t the device when i it to my pc	0
this phone joke is a winner	1
the screen is bright and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
is cool the fm radio	1
player works and looks great if can get the dvd is to play	1
the only other minor issues i can think of are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
on dvds so far refuses play with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
the speakers have a very rich would need a huge subwoofer and good bass also bass not you obviously for which thumping sound	1
are very good the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject as long as you make sure your subject is no more than about feet away	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the hard drive with room for about more	1
it great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
the come that earbuds with it are nt that bad	1
this product is not available at any price	1
speed usb means fast data transfers	1

battery life	0
after seeing and listening to the sound of the i tour pop speaker i have decided	1
i left right using jbl n ii excellent surround am which is set a very nice as speaker again	1
the pictures are amazing and their is a lot more to it there are tons of pictures that i have nt even gotten to	1
it in a mp camera my greatest expectations surpasses	1
the is easily scratched if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
the menu options looking for scroll as see menu items to pick from t you a full screen of can you have to uncreative up and down to find what you re are	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
you ll be changing track information you ll be listening to a lot of music the music a on the cd lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is cd maker mediocre at best	0
without having go netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the steps far better	0
range of functions as indicated above it camera with basic functions has is a great camera that something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions a lot of features for those who are serious about photography	1
every penny this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
was support tech very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
the main problem for me is that the transition from the sub to the control panel is too short	0
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my home	1
this is an excellent value	1
i navigating using the player built in menu and it still	1
however the main reason i am not with this product satisfied is the fact times it will lock up that odd at	0
listen thing is great pick like to use up to i it tough stains on my countertop and also to this to my old track records	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
before asking for this mp player for christmas i researched many different mp players but i finally decided on this one and now that i have it i have used it many times and i am convinced it is the best one out there	1
is included earpiece the very comfortable and easy to use	1
so yes as with all software bundled the game it was useless and a mix of good and bad with creative products it was useless and a mix of good ugly	0
however too impressed the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact i am not that it will lock up at odd times	0
i ve do only slightly better bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g to seems been	0
i wo nt go into the details here as go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed picture quality the flexibility automation and the conveniences camera offers	1

such a large screen others may have better luck but i with such poor viewing angles other screens have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
has static obviously problems with the router ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
due to the this router having lack for whs upnp guestnetwork and of just dropped the bones for support i was very unimpressed	0
was	1
the tiny remote unit it wonderful not only does to trigger the is shutter can also be used it zoom and review pictures	1
say that in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
the inside pics can a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments this camera very simple and effective	0
the problems came video my from card	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
i tried it as bunch of different formats to see if it would work and it did	1
overall small sounds expensive great and less expensive than apple is good overpriced ipod	1
i do it but care for gracenotes genre listings always nt allows easy editing of id tags	1
i one of the best a laptop looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the ard set of discs standard set of features and of dvd players have this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
the combination of price storage and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
oh yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i just went and got a new dsl modem i love it	1
this phone is highly recommended by me otherwise	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally we keep trying something it will when it did not work	0
the main problem with the zen jukebox is xtra gb nomad the software	0
in any case navigation to is ok miss i however an ability by artist album navigate by folders	0
the very rich have for which speakers sound and good bass bass obviously not thumping also you a would need a huge subwoofer	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on program auto	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it proven itself to all that it is advertised	1
the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
in short if you re just someone that is but just want to check my opinion and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this route a little afraid not of technology bit check my opinion and you just want a router to get online do basic networking  and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at the bass to drop at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no the bass is not balanced you cant get thebass to drop in your room you cannot getthebassto drop a lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no the bass to drop at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the level try matter how you tweak the levels	0
i have no complaints with this game or the player	1

only one thing to note about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerbo feature once when you are on the other end of the phone not while it is ringing	0
the monitors were both results good	1
my other gripe the incredibly crappy remote which is worse	0

i from this one what chose because i read it was the best deal for the money	1

the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
well the theory was great mode on the server but upon enabling the guest mode in the network things stopped working	0
do like this phone overall but	1
phone an excellent overall	1
multiple play modes with different songs in order of popularity etc is standard on all jukebox games but worth noting that the zen mode is not deficient in this regard	1
since it would i work as advertised not called support	0
the zen stores data files but allow folder structure nor allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched its disk	0
well player apex dvd this turned out great	1
speakerphone	1
size i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability size was a big zero	0
and it has sooooo much music and audio files	1
you ll be and you ll be missing changing track information a lot the cd maker out because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
all and all i extremely am pleased with this camera	1
at this price point recommend this monitor hard to beat highly	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
despite the things that i dont like i could not be happier with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to and from to the store etc etc	1

what bothers me is the fact that it does not allow me to read the dvds	0
also the carrying case that get to the buttons and came with mine comes covers up the display so n even though the side controls are reachable has a plastic cover that i open have to open it up to see the display	0

before i bought my mp player for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i couldn t be happier and i m pretty sure it	1

the person too on the other end hear of the call can hear you perfectly	1
the of filling manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1

i have yet to try out all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light level adjustments etc but all controls are there and and the manual is very clear	1
it is not an extremely cool gizmo	0

the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that may arise	1
i will never never buy a creative product again	1

i found that it was comparable to or possibly slightly better than the one i had been using for years	1
for me is great the storage capacity	1

i a few of them tried these speakers and found them to to buy the shares preform well below expectations for this price	0
is the woofer much larger	1
it it worth is	1
considering might this the price and specs be the best a large memory mp player out there for buy	1
sure more expensive it is a little bigger than the ipod one i had before but not by much	0
i have stored around on it is the cd i havent cd is on this and have the only thing i have barely touched the available memory	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at works times and i have had the same problem with works doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
even the bass is a little weak from such rather small drivers	0
how to hook up	1
and so far with being had any problems have dvds not not able to play	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
and annoying when you does its it pay for a router nt work as it out straight is supposed of the box	0
i personally would not recommend this router in a large house hold or small buisiness environmnets	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb t anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection really good and the speakers are also lrb although not much of a difference from the speakers in the room the sound is really good als although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection really good and the speakers are also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case really you see like you own reflection on th but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case really you see  like you own reflection on the screen	0

creative of each fact my in mp players had software problem in the first place	0
is it easy	1
i think i will be giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems i had with the previous version but as i have only had the phone for a while i leave room for doubt if the keyboard jack issues or scroll wheel	1
the fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only  because minor  it bluetooth would have been nice to have but there are very few problems with things that would expect you expected this phone to d lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that would expect you expected this phone to do	0

had a great time they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
the buttons interface are very easy to use	1
the good news is that the unit has both coax and coaxial audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the brochure i d scanned before buying	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the wireless earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1

i have to say i m actually pretty impressed by the quality of the sound quality especially for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see the writing enough is big and for people to see	1
treat i the battery well and it has lasted	1
second the changed menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
it worked great and we	1
but anyway the other thing you should take a look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
i of the house nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is floor the speed much the on and would is bottom improved	0
this kind of dvd play is basicly junk	0
player was everything i it be an affordable multi format player with a case as advertised	1

the front cover can pop off it easily but i always have mine in the case so i did dont nt if you are not careful notice after first day	0
i are no buttons on it there especially love the remote controller stand and the fact that there with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	0

t i find it too bright	0
a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
it is easy for you to keep it open to see what song you re listening to	1
for but what i do use it is perfect	1
vocals the guitar have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
only thing missing from creative a cd burner is	0
no changes to the format	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one	1
my biggest problem with this speaker incompatibility with nd generation nano	0

the player has like turn on percent of the time it sais down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again not	0
it has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of plastic and put some on the corners	0
not it is made of plastic	0
it still fits in palm the palm of your hand fits and it is not heavy	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to when it use i am audio books listening to	1
i am very happy with this product and given its features and specifications price the very reasonable was	1
is usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
it would have been much nicer it had a window so you could see the screen and if the did cover up the ac jack	0
when you continues on your were turning it off the player turns on really fast and left music turn when play as you the it to you player	1
i especially love selector knob stand with it is big remote controller volume and simple the buttons	1
can be done but it ripping your songs should and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
when not saw be as good of concerned where there was metal i was plastic that the sound would i a lot	1
has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
it is running great all the dvds	1
when i saw was the there was metal i a lot of plastic concerned that sound where would not be as good	1
also i can t understand why the the list the list software does not ignore the when it lists the site cds in alphabetical order i can t understand why the the list softwar software does not ignore the when it lists the site cds in alphabetical order	0
very good value for the money	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit in to standard rectangular layout keypads but is not too weird	0
i took the plunge with this new product and am pleased except in the fact that it will cost you half the price but that is the price for a state of the art	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
reason rated it a four is of its very small and so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
but great camera is this	1
the sound very good quality is very good	1
and it with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
even impressive bass is pretty the from such rather small drivers	1
at the very more protective a sturdier least case carrying would be nice	0

and can has it for such a great price how go wrong you amazon com	1
great it is a have to worry about fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
over for this is a good unit	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
i sound a little wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
as a portable player it should if you wear it feel a bit more durable	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand dvd players	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i did a ton of research and found a lot of value on this phone because of the great speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
what a disappointment	0
the player has its minor glitches like when i turn it on percent of the time it sais which i to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
i think the lens cap design is flawed	0
but with a low price a high risk comes lower quality	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes the router to manually the the front gui one would work	0
anyway this is a great deal and i really love it	1
so now it still plays looks like it everything you just can t see it	0
even bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
this is a great camera not for you	1
last night i forgot to reset the router	0
even the bass is pretty impressive from here	1
is not always responsive the scroll button depressing	0
there of included such as eax and customization	1
but the sound quality is very good is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
form look and good build the player comes in a compact with a metal face plate chic	1
when the computer was nt contracting or glitching the performance was poor to fair	0
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
so if you re game for a little adventure you may be very happy with this day in your life	1
the system has failed repeatedly	0
find i it too bright	0
i have charged treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0

how easy to hook up	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which will help us experience photography on a totally new level	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can will be looking withstand a better product the rigor of a business traveler	0
big minus also does nt have voice activated dialing it	0
it	1
tech support was pleasent and helpfull once you someone	1
its heavier seem and much larger use might which far to matter except if you not it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i found useful as a tool it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork having just dropped the for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the windows premium is good but i do nt recommend starter rrb and user interface	1
well the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
of storage price gb	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox	0
it does have a lense cap but it is nt too heavy and you can take pics with it on which is real good	1
video has stopped workin	0
manual and auto the function auto and manual lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0

frame freezes and the family yells that there are somethings wrong with the dvd player come on	0
getting access connection to the device is so easy	1
they caused a problem ie when they put it in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said	0
few was simple to set up and has worked couple for the the netgear router well to last months i have had it	1
the infrared is have a previous nokia if transfer you a and want re blessing your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of to entering my numbers	1
fios d link support my more helpful the router and guided to the actual problem which was that me failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from was this time optical network block	1
second automatic lets you the songs before it begins	1
upon these i found them really small but having a solid them	1
save also made the fact that custom playlist can i you you liked on the player not just the computer	1
some people is problems been the case on the bottom that releases the player cover has not with an issue for me if the switch immaterial and you use the flip switch as the case covers have	1
it was a snap to set up and my ps asus eee netbook pcs all without issue	1
i personally would recommend in every house hold small buisiness environmnets	0
ring tones only come with crazy only one ring and annoying rings there songs is that to close sounds a regular ring	0
is weak the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
proven canon lens built quality and lens	1
my friend and i just bought a house that has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
battery life is pretty good but i recommend two rechargebles or a spare battery as a backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
acceptable its x optical setting is however for of the shots that i take	1
the zennx will running for the price a replacement battery just any battery powered appliance	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit awful it worked well is i set it but top of a portable radio with it was on somewhat to use in the car which when trying of a disappointment	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges the above mp cameras by of approval use to understand and easy a lot of features add on and fiance comes with great software and last but of far not least received my options stamp is all	1
so it was useless and ugly as with all software bundled with it it was unusable	0
this phone is great as a phone and is not like any other phone with one or two good qualities	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the fact that it doesnt have any options for processing raw images i only shoot in raw mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
volume level ok is	1
if you looking for a quality tower speaker this it	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the speakers are able to fill out the sound outs exceedingly well	1

i find all of the controls well placed to be very intuitive and not flimsy difficult to use in the least	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit cool screen is and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants to use it for music and external speakers	1
though do while really that think up i i mean hooked my xbox matters to the standard vga port a little nt ago and the picture was awesome	1
despite a flaw using eax reviewers giving kudos to the zen experienced i for music quality most	0
if your life is shaky i hope it does not get worse otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
do nt this buy monitor	0
range of functions as indicated above something point and shoot power plus advanced functions those who are serious about	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
the only drawback the is speaker wire is very thin	0
worried was i would megapixel photos that download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
only owned it for a month so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan or player of higher quality very soon	0
the monitors were both black	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts for a year on one single charge the software is great and it is easy to get in it chrome is great	1
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
there still an is i alarm havent used it yet but it should be good	1
for two months ve pleased had the camera i and i m even more now with it	1
the pictures are razor sharp too	1
lastly i feel that flaw  the speakers were over priced for what i paid for them got lrb unless there and i think that is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i have used	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully charge the battery the battery can be charged via the included ac adapter	1
great camera	1
the volume range is great so you can on this blast it if you want	1
it has a x and y zoom which is average for a smartphone	0
it plays every dvd i ve tested so far even an old dvd that i ripped years ago and the only dvd on my dvd player that could nt be played was the one on my old sharp player	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this was the first time i was able to take a picture of something	1
as always and it super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
it a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
it really impressed me with the disign the design and the price	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and play them directly from your player to your playlist	1

to immediately had problems getting recognize i the player two of my favorite dvds	0

the mms technology is very well integrated with which you will enjoy	1
but if you re looking of the apex dvd player for opinion my i love it	1
the design and construction are superb as is the legendary quality of the nikon wood	1
the sound is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds great with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all the more impressive because these are not your average headphones highly recommended	0
battery life is good although i recommend two battery life rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics take you have to have	1
ripping usb cable out the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
for those want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
is system this very powerful	1
and it works great too	1
lrb lost internet connection connection with the router due to a power outage internet internet service was restored when to the router the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
it is lighter to carry around and it easy has enough functionality to use	1
when the player was working it was not a problem but	0
they could consistent with the music be of a pop song more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
i have nt had time a player of this quality to really not push this player to the results i have seen so far the limit but audio aspects on the nomad really are satisfactory as should be expected from creative test labs	1
the display is very good and the text rendering is good enough that you can forget entirely about workspace issues	1
color and are perfect for my needs contrast	1
usb for fast data transfers	1
there was lip sync a occasionally issue	0
the switch the router the and just fine speed presented negotiated with a gige link	1

highly is worth every penny and i this camera recommend it	1
unfortunately the computer would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in the fire	0
it surpasses my greatest expectations in the performance a mp camera	1
all in all this is a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features and an interface that is simple to understand and use and a great user experience	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and in the setup and security aspects	1

slow to download and run certain programs wish the best hope helped	0
i purchased and three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are with them extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
detracts is added prone to popping off as what in build quality functionality the face plate is in	0

the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
from the speakers so if you want to get a bigger sound you would need a hug the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not a bigger speaker than a subwoofer but there is a lot of thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	0
anyway is this player a great deal and i really love it	1

it around with you is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
the on off button is very small and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that has to be pressed to turn on the camera	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
huge storage space at kbs you can store a of songs on thing	1
i was really impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
the quality of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this is a case where the company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
its small size which might not seem to be a problem except if you use it while running or if you keep it in your pocket	0
in other words the price is not a good indicator of your data storage capacity you can only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
also the feature update the page to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
for great price all the features	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency conversion and a built in camera	1
phones is one of the nicest this nokia has made	1
second the automatic transfer of your music which lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
this phone of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
the controls on the keyboard are very simple no need to know	0

this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
i e mailing and they come back saying undeliverable	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
lack of bass which i have my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0

anyway this player one is a great deal and hope you like i really love it	1
it is more than days and it not have to be does a month old a year old not show the picture no matter what i do	1

what really made this for me was the software	1
i for not willing to accept shoddy construction something on i paid over dollars m	0
i think the real reason that they made the changes is that it now makes sense to use gpu hardware acceleration	1
i am happy and have no complaints over this unit	1
unfortunately it turns out to the disposable	0
i am using jbl n ii as left right which again very nice excellent set	1
not plug play relies on it	0
the memory is gone	0
other things that i miss are bluetooth activated dialing and internet access	0
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
well turned this apex dvd player out great	1
setup software for my application on found the setup software i the enclosed cd to be useless	0
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
the movie clips taken will probably have some noise in it you can t hear	0
is really good screen brightness	1
other than that this thing is great	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
camera the is a dream to aperture priority shutter priority in automode but also gives operate flexibility in tremendous and manual modes	1
quality very bad	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software that comes bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1

in a world where others say not bright enough	0
at ounces it is lighter than the mp pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
the g problems in low light would not take the picture when shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released few seconds	0
