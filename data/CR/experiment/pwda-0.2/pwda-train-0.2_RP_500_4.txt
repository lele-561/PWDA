i lived in a small college apartment the e s and f s were nice but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the system through windows explorer windows recognizes the nomad as an additional hard disk so it allows you to easily drag and drop files from the main drive to a folder for the nomads to access	1

but then again it can be argued that i heard it ringing in my office when i was already out on the street	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the speakers have a very good soundstage with good treble and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up things on my countertop and then to listen to music	1
protective case is useless as is since it obscures display window	0

i ve now had the chance to try it out and i m even more pleased with it	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1

it works flawlessly for me	1
the subwoofer is very loud and s l o w and it just sounds unnatural even with the subwoof know the volume is all the way down but it is not because these are bad speakers	0

the font size is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you can read it	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is easy to read and easy for people to see	1
sound quality is poor	0
i think it too bright	0
the bag that came with it did nt fit very well	0

as a whole the cd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
you ca nt go wrong with this if what you are looking for is a good deal in a small package	1
my only gripe about the hardware is that	0

the rate at which things are also falling at least for me	0
material is on the cheap	0

its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
view this screen	1
it took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
in this system the zen xtra uses i tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0

without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
the speakerphone the radio all features are available	1
however here is a list for of the shots that i take	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear the music	0
due to the lack of support for the project and having just dropped the project from my mind i was very unimpressed	0
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
the only disadvantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace the cheap user replaceable battery is not available	1

i am able to carry it on my person and in places where other weapons are not so easily concealed	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a variety of different methods and i still can t get a good signal from the machine	0

the keys are a bit small and the layout is a bit weird in comparison to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
it is not easy enough to use at the moment but it has plenty of features for me to get into	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
i am also using jbl i and jbl ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent sound set	1
it allows the ip address on the router to be used as a proxy for nas or print server	1
i am using them in my office and they generally work well	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i have used	1
this is a very good looking phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
exasperated at am i going to call it quits and will be bringing this useless product back	0

on dvds so that it would be possible to watch certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0

the canon eos d mark ii is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1

compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i spent hours on that and i could not connect to the internet	0
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few months and its been of use to me	0
the only bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is useless	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the lack of a manual	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
after multilple tries it was finally recognized but video was missing and features not working	0
the labeling process itself is a mystery and suggests that the government is just scrambling to put out fires	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
the music sync feature is superb that comes with nokia software	1
it also has a very interesting and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1

protective case completely unusable as is since it obscures display area	0
the sound is pretty good for the price although not anything like a surround system and there is some distortion but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you can see you own reflection on the screen	0
also it sometimes freezes not a very big problem but still annoying	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i was a little surprised to see it in the low end	0
excellent battery life hours of play time ipod is	1

navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1

they caused the problem ie the software in the box the service tech was unable to believe what the software said was wrong	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth adapter	1
then my dvds would either be in the background playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0

i also really liked the fact that you can play the game that you made on the player not just the computer	1
the on off button is somewhat flimsy and has an extremely tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the light	0
