color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
progressive scan player for a great deal a relatively low price	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1

and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
now there shooting raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the  is  one more complaint i have mbyte cf with a about the g and that is the the software that comes with it for processing raw images and i have mbyte cf with a about the g and that i software that comes with it  for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i   did was replace the mbyte cf with a  mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0

space storage capacity	1
my only significant complaint real is sound quality	0
the best fm radio is cool	1

despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g interested anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the quality of the sound software is not good either and no way of the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
shut off and the dvd player would the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused  to occasionally not turn on	0
being i love the storage in this thing	1
they fired away turned and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
naturally i bit did quite a bit of review before is pretty good purchasing but i think the quality and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
the picture editing software software that it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
the speakerphone the radio all features speakerphone and work perfectly	1
i purchased with it this phone for just and there is no with it end to what i can do have been playing with it	1

the remote hard to get used to is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago works great and so far it has been excellent	1
only thing missing from creative from this is a cd burner	0
however for a budget is a great option and i do think this i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
seemed like a good deal but is not very good it this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes it a long time system loading and then concludes no disc	0
uploading i have not yet seen any problems i have had of the usual problems with digital pictures so yet i am very pleased	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
the interior of the car case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0

joystick the controls on the player are very simple no need controls for a manual	1
in other words data the zen is not order to save your a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for data your music collection	0
dont think i would be if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i would not give them think they do the job that them based use most people want them for	0
cheap construction they should have made the bottom put player out of hard plastic and put some top rubber on the corners	0

the dvd link to the player does not work properly	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the picture editing software it came with good is adequate but not very quality is good the robust	1
speakerphone easy to usesmartphone loud and clear has a lot of features some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
in stylish wireless addition it comes with a sleek stylish and powerful headset	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear clear and would i would still purchase this all over again	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
the volume range is great hear everything so you can blast it if you want	1
and really the best this is the best phone one could have	1
very overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
this was removed because it was an awesome player before works the video output no longer worked	0

creative are the sound people for computers i see can t understand why they eax would introduce static	0

the size world is small	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive service the fact that their customer service tells you about ability the quality of their products and their willingness to stand customer behind them	0
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low is no desk to the desk	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1

sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not do other monitors be able to fit in	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
what makes the focus lock so short lag time i have something i can live with is the extreme depth of field  obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
too difficult to change this album may refer to a genre album track information for large number of or tracks	0
within a few listening the software is very easy to use very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
me this product is too fragile for normal use	0
and would love to replace i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the finally system with a sweet jbl sub	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0

for those of us those of us  that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
however if speed reliability and power deliver a good signal to transmit home and the ability to connect multiple devices to all parts of a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
njeh but i would definately recommend this phone	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price for less than how can you go wrong	1

the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward awkward to press tiny obtuse feel to it and it feels little lock out a bit button that needs activate it to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
