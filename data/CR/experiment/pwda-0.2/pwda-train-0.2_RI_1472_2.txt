love it i  bought my canon new i g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
this was very of prompt standard shipping service	1
the g had problems focusing on the subject in low light and seconds later would not take the picture when the shutter was the camera pressed but after the a picture shutter had been released a few seconds	0
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the included  earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
unfortunately please note that it can t play all of the dvd	0
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
avoid this model like like the plague	0
overall it is the best camera on i think the market	1
scroll down button switch	0
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the battery the battery the fact that the user perhaps can replace the battery him herself by opening the best feature that the lid and popping in the new battery	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has not very good made most of my songs sound worse this than without it	0
ripping your songs selling them online and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
everything was great until it started it dropping internet connection sporadically	0

the person on the other of the phone end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1

this in phone is good with a huge array of features good camera and an built into it	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0

it being heavy is light enough to carry around all day day long without bother	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time are times when its not enough and there but there of giving you all the options are manual settings for those who want them	1
the reception and sound quality were poor are top notch	0
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
this same way has work the happened with several different dvd is work again and again even and occasionally if again with the same dvd so i guess we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0

screen was good it easy to read	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
my only gripe about the hardware phone is the buttons	0
i think the real reason that made one of the reasons the changes is that it now me want to make uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
are working great they i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you money on a car but at all but if you want to spend want something that has the asthetics of a sports car and the safety bit down of course	0
the functionality of this app on this camera is mind blowing	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
i have to say i m also pretty very impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvd impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files impressed stored pretty very impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvd i have to have say i am pretty very impressive by theuser interfacefor playingjpeg m etty ver on cd rs dvds	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
even if its works better on g band than the linksys	1
it would spin read spin some more and then and then stop show on the display that there for a few seconds was no disc	0
dr johns awesome sound system	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
i bought my canon g a little over a about a month ago and and a half ago i have to say i am very satisfied	1
make to keep it short this better is cheaper and in my opinion a opinion it is better choice than an ipod	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
folders can not be following created for the audio files	0
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the most amazing amount minutest of details	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
a great camera great investment	1
just an average example of a user getting good value in this product	1
does does it well which what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
well it had good power but no precision i thought at all	1
mid loud enough to get your music out the bass range is nt the best but to your music this is a good option for it is certainly there and enough to response satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
only thing missing from creative from this is a cd burner	0
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
was the sound quality what really made this really a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
for the price it very good is a well spent investment	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up picking the next day and for me paying for the return shipping	1
i love this player	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows a better option for the season and i like to use my own which is what i have	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
what got me to buy was up the reviewer would play dvd files and it did play my fill of file that said it t fill up would play dvd rs fill of files	1
easy set to hook up	1
now that i able to live without own it however i imagine ever can t imagine being without it	1
red bright visible screen	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and buying the wifi bluetooth modules	1
after using it for just a month i could for a while not play any playing dvd	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the router recognized my other wifi was very easy to set up devices easily wireless and further setup was a breeze	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who  i am sure the phone line the one lonely customer service reps is probably extremely overworked as swer the customer servic does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number be able to get in touch with me as their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as swer their calls i am sure the phone line the on is constantly busy as swer their emails and calls i am sure the phone line the one lonely and telephone number i am sure the phone line the one lonely customer service reps is probably extremely overworked as swer thei customer  service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
they sound really good just as the say reviews say	1
it also costs a lot a lot less than the ipod	1

even better you do nt have to if the battery dies worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
very clear and the sound is surprising full with very a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the top that covered the battery completely dead kept poping off without much of a touch warning and the battery was near the bottom latch	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
anything this phone does it does well perfectly	1
i would recommend recommend this product to anyone	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
a lot of features speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
well backlit room keypad	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
audio is the quality excellent	1
buttons the buttons on the phone are all small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the   remote control are only the characters it only shows the ones with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting befor so so it does nt show the complete filenames of  mp s with really long names you must cycle  through every zoom setting before the characters it only shows the ones with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before gettin getting back to normal size	0
i really have no one complaints over this unit	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
quality sound quality is good	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
creative zen feedback suffers and a lack of ergonomics but there is good feedback about the ease of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphon about the design of the device which suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel about the design of the device which suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack but there is good feedback about a lack of ergonomic and  reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	1

highly dvd player and the recommend getting i would the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the price was the lowest price i have ever seen at the i d i d ever seen seen in my life i d my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
the screen may font be a little small for my taste smaller but bit it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
however if job for you speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across router will do the jo the house are your requirements then this is to connect to the internet and router high will do the job	0
this is my second creative labs in a row rd mp player and it is definitely always a pleasure to use such a fine product	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this support did not fix solve the problem	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
the image quality the quality is excellent	1
here all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the quality the price is very good	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
color color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
the software very easy to use and is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
