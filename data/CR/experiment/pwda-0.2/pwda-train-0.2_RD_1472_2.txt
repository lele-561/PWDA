the ability to an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1

the first got this put it next to me i went to bed just to to my favorite music station itself does nt and feel so comfy with it	1

i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player had than the standard set of features this item seemed be best in that category	0
the positive side of the player is pretty once you have everything configured	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0

it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
the build quality is top notch	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
i do nt really though i mean hooked up to the standard vga port a little while ago was awesome	1

so now it still plays everything just can t see it	0
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
the size is small	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery suggests this company is scrambling to put out fires	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0

my other gripe the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
size little bit than the ipod and weighs a little bit more	0

after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge for the buck	1
the end i wanted was a player which allows to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
but then again the ringer can so loud that i heard ringing when was already out on	1
creative are the sound people for computers can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
the setup process for the nomad and the interface with the is sub par	0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0

i it was just the player but then i started the discs to that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with turned all the way down but it all right because these are computer speakers	0

i was able take great photos of the th july fire works got some amazing shots of the kids	1
the case is too small took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity fit in cage	0

i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc enough	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1

the setup process for the nomad is infuriating the interface with the player is sub par	0

another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
it does tend to and should given of room circulation	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1

when the player working it was great	0
the sound enhancement nt do enough and the custom was a limited band eq	0

installation was hell	0
memory is staggering	1
sound exceptional though can really compare it to the ipod	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
i find the lack of on this phone quite disturbing	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and did job i bought it for admirably	1
its far more difficult select and has easy to use on the fly playlist such as new ipod to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
i found to be really small but feel to them	1
canon never fails to amaze	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
t is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
it would just spin up and	0
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
however since i am in an office keep them at a volume and at they a little weak	0
the system is terrific size and design imo better the ipods	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1

this player flawlessly for me and this price you go wrong	1

voice recording these would have been nice extras	0

because this camera is beautiful	1
indoor shots a flash are not	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
i two of these players christmas gifts and were bad	0
if re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
they re stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
anyway this player i really it	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
i am to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	0
this has that you ll always have room for new technologies as	0
very long lasting battery life	1
i fell in with camera it combines ease of use an immense amount of options and	1
its focusing system also very flexible	1
the replacement than the original one which was now working fine	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i really notice display is off in which case you see own reflection on the screen	0
sound is good it takes sound on a portable mp player to result	0
the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on program auto	1
even leaving it produces crystal clear playback	1
due to the lack for and having just the bones for this router i	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built it	1
they are clears and perfect be used along with a sub	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
a week out of the box began to see slight contractions from time time more frequent each day	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
this time d link support was more helpful guided me to the actual problem which was the router failed auto negotiate ethernet link speed my optical network block	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant on my hdtv and delivering great	1
small size	1
had no problems all so far and i very happy	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
music is based on id and be older downloaded music files with information	0
it is light enough to around all day without bother	1
first of all the player sound quality	1

got a system error problem days after purchase	0
i have ever experienced	1
when got it i discovered the menu for sending messages either text or simply there	0
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i have not yet any with digital pictures i am very pleased	1
user replaceable battery	1
however you do get what you pay for in products	1
only nits i are it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it slow	0
sound quality wonderful really	1
yes the picture quality and features are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera this price range	1
its fast forward and work much more smoothly and consistently those of other models i ve had	1
in class	1
ripping and creating playlists could be any easier	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
mediasource did not install	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased of of these monitors have already been	0

is small overall bigger than the but keep in mind this is because less expensive not necessarily inferior technology is	1
it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
apex is for dvd players	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
after nearly i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
for that is still less the lowest level ipod i able to get this gb monster the is it works as it was advertised to and then	0
the problem is that fastest anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was to it down to where i having to it my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
player was everything i it be an affordable multi format player with a case as advertised	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the sound is the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
the sound came from that cheap little record player like carnegie hall	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1

battery life the drawback to cameras to	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
storage capacity	1
the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning	1
it would have been if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
it is and well worth the price	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
office starter web cam also fairly good in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say bad you are just paying for this net book	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the files into it	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics course	0
wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
it gives great pictures are to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it casing	1

of the g gives better picture quality in low light and optical zooms you just that much closer	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work due to heavy snow	0
i m extremely glad i bought	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
the g has a type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but turns it only contained a of instructions and offered by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
they could be more comfortable but in the sound department	1
i do nt think really matters i hooked my xbox up to the standard vga a little while ago and was awesome	1

equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1

silverish color adds a special touch	1

the sound quality except maybe a tad too times there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1

i would strongly	1
this was very prompt shipping	1
multiple play modes tracks order of album shuffle etc is standard on noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
what got me to buy the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
it the perfect size it has all the a high tech phone user would want	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1

it has a beautiful design lots of features easy to use configurable and and the battery duration is amazing	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0

they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
software is real	1

this time d link was more helpful me to the actual problem which was that the router failed auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1

even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1

without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb ever size it is rrb power adapter	0
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
highly recommend a nokia	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better for windows which is what have	1

other than that is great	1
the on the player are very simple no need for	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery	1
the backlight will fail the first time happened i sent in for warranty repair	0
the final insult is while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers it is to download the trial software from the internet pay an additional to some unknown company to all the features	1
but the sound is and well on my portable speakers	1
meanwhile the instructions indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained of instructions and offered nothing by way on for apple computers	0

is which does not work long stretches on that same route	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
overall sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but was long for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
but after days the worked but quit working	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
for a specific location think its a phone	0
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0

the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
overall i would to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
because this camera	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
newbies will find the auto setting will them perfect pictures right of	1
it is made of plastic	0
ve been using the g about six weeks and has proven itself to be	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0

the volume	0
when you turn the player on and the music continues to play as you left you were turning it off	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0

if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1

small than the ipod but in mind this is different less expensive but not necessarily inferior is used in the zx	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music be placed in a folder called unknown	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
the software has nt a for me at all	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on with room about more	1
the crispness and readability the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good	1

the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1

on dvds it refuses to episodes with no problems on the others	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0

i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1

overall i like the system features and performance	1

unfortunately i bought a player because ps could nt play all my dvds now the player can t play everything	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
the digital zoom as good of pictures the optical zoom does	1
there one more complaint i have about the g and the software that with it for processing raw i only in raw image mode and the first i replace cf with a mbyte cf gives raw to	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so that they just return the device	0
bottom line well made camera easy use powerful to the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0

this excellent player for the price with features are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in philips machine	1

i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1
it has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
not a bad monitor but it is nothing	1
for the cost this product	1
excellent picture quality on par with panasonic and jvc players	1
i think apex is the dvd you can get for the price	0
pc sync feature is comes with	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
even better with the headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	0
not only the perfect also has all the a high tech phone user would want	1
like a good deal but this frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no	0
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the speakerphone is quite powerful	1
creative awkward difficult to and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
the zennx keep running the price of a replacement battery just like other battery powered	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
great	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
i would be inclined to purchase an apex product again	1
i am very with this product will be using it often	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
i this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no asked replacement warranty will be since creative will only which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
proven canon built quality and lens	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1

this phone has a cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
one also exhibited when going to the menu	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd that had more than the standard set and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
d link does not provide mac for the adapter however i was able find a free third party driver is	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider one more of these super displays	1
tests showed that the wireless speeds were to of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable as input	1
have mine for a month now and say i have enjoyed it	1
i have it for a week and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
the battery is nice	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
however you crank volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i to get done with some background music viola audio lrb well this is great for a speaker	1
this phone me over a big seller was the size fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
sharp image	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor dell ultrasharp in of and viewing angles	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
material is on the cheap side	0
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
the picturers are amazing	1
surprisingly everything seems to	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the player itself has all sorts	1
the day finally i d leave sprint	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
or screwed up that does nt know what to do	0
have used it frequently and had no problems	1
i have tried times to a hold of apex who does nt seem and telephone number is as the one lonely customer service rep	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
again the sounds were and projected where should the front of	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that will cause you miss precious shots	0
as a cell phone thank god	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
the sound this design puts out	1
the service from t is very good too	1
while i had the phone the positive features were sound quality an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the lcd screen great	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out ll one more	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
in menu etc	1
it is most bang for the buck out there	1
this phone is	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
overall a sweet machine	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
c i do love audio sync which a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
mp is right for the target market of this camera	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
there was a lip sync issue	0
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
bottom i have the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to for less than half the cost	1
after we the problems we tried to contact apex but never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
i m sure would and can be useful in a different setting one you only need to at a whisper	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
the phone line responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
also it was only free shipping and no tax so is a decent player	1
great camera and for the price you t beat it	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
very good range and seemed to be in the horizontal position	1
the lcd larger than the previous model the nx has a bright blue illuminates more than is green backlight did	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy although as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
buttons seem a and the hands free kits connector	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
also it was very easy set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it nt hear a thing	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
i ve sent to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
what a	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
size extremely small and fit in your pocket and not bother	1
after multilple tries was finally recognized but video was and features available	1
i have no problem what so with this product	0
good looks	1
progressive player for a relatively low price	1
typically the problem is it was for	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
slow and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
feature automatically put in is nt always accurate	0
there is much has been said in other of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems	1
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
allows the usb interface on the router to used either	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
i spent hours on phone lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to and got at least imac and back	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
it is it	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning the sharp lines and excellent grip better than any other camera i ve seen	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to any of divx rips	0
and the body construction general has quite a bit of plastic a after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
i usually avoid but do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
it plays media i ve tested so far even an old vcd i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be on my old sharp player	1
while decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower with standard speakers making harder to hear some audio	0
what me is the fact it not seem to read certain dvds	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
this player is not worth price and recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
i love this player	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
tried calling the support number for several times day and got a busy signal	0
i am absolutely in awe of camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
i nt for see myself having any issues it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that be taken care of free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps of amazon in getting to me was faster than i expected and it what i knew it would be	1
works great	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
lrb yeah you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
bright visible screen	1
is big over the ipod touchpad	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
this product is amazing	1
international has done all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker hook ups	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but problematic problem random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
after i had it it into a state where it could never find the device no matter often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is was no help at all	0
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
super easy	1
the buttons interface are very easy to use	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
anyways to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of with acer and their terrible service support	0
one last note i purchased monitor with a higher price than what you get in the states	0
this is a good deal for music and data	1
i ve had this thing just over a month the headphone jack has already	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
setup simple it worked right out of the box	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
when put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in lengths the speaker wire as expected even out of doors	1
the interface itself which be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
unit then video output failed	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
and love and as such i suplemented with a sweet jbl sub	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
whether you taking waiting a bus just having lunch at the park ll glad you had the fm radio	0
quality has been poor since day one the constantly and now seems to some sort short circuit in the base can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
the feels it does nt shake whine while discs the picture and is notch	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
the appearance is okayed	1
the is great	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
it worked for then the problems came	1
i was that was nt more helpful	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on phone	1
is ok	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars	1
this is one of that i ve ever owned	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i like this phone overall but unforutnately i am	1
arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for of price	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
one bad thing is that comes a mb compactflash most purposes it is not enough	0
the battery life seems takes to charge uploads mp s and there is no delay between songs	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like and have a miserable repair facility to their products	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately	0
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
oops easy and adjust it there	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
but it seems work so well now that i do anticipate any problems with it	1
i have owned this camera for a short time would nt give up for anything	1
have used it frequently and no problems	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
most will last if taken care of logitech products are no exception to rule however they are somewhat fact than my old	1
with gb of storage i have about on the player room about more	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the speakers very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream from the xtra	1
only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
sub woofer is large	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
speakerphone	1
now the backlight fails i to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
the routers worked good years	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
we this on was perfect condition as can be for in mind i m extremely computer savvy my opinion comes to a lot	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
it nt firewire not a real complaint since do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
environmental audio however is almost completely useless has made most of my songs	0
will read and play all disc	1
this router is phenomenal	1
not only is it more affordable but its which what i have	1
the ihome is stereo is clearly superior	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without from the sub woofer no matter how you	0
works and looks great if can get the dvd is to play	1
product is good enough to integrate clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
i looking forward it even all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
i give a rating of stars for	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and of all great price	1
after discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but never got in touch with them customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not their web customer support	0
the storage capacity is great	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
only if we could get one camera in it	0
full sound from to great highs	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
it is easy to use for a beginner like me but it plenty of features for to grow into	1
sound quality is good	1
only owned about two weeks so i expect we looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player higher quality very soon	0
scroll button switch	0
there was occasionally issue	0
all in all device bad service run like hell from this product	0
has the features would need in a cellphone	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
bookmarks for example an feature but not on this player	0
came and i was momentarily glad that rumors d heard acer tech support did nt turn to be in case	0
it works great	1
zennx is replaceable battery was in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
i quite happy having over gigs on as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
has one would need in a cellphone	1
i got this for christmas it is a great gift	1
this a nice feature i e it is in the morning and you listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal	1
this thing is great i to use it to pick up tough stains my countertop also to to my old track records	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
in summary love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
the fm radio cool	1
through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i did nt read a thing it was just intuitive	0
in an setting are a little dull and rarely if tend take photographs from a distance	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
ve had this for and i am pleased with my decision	1
creative mediasource software is ok rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
i have this monitor a month now i m very pleased with it	1
the problems came from video card	0
no problems dropped signals unlike it replaced which only months	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
are really cool like the radio	1
now that i have all my on it there been any more problems	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
will find full auto setting will give them right out of the box	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
only complaint is others here randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it	0
very good value for the money	1
my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even read at all	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
the g looks like a work of art	1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
i like the size weight of this little	1
minor complaints though the music via on the player the option to for contained in a folder is unavailable	0
first the cons a tad not the most asthetic looking and does nt support a stucture	0
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying is	0
i m glad to keep the mp resolution and improved upon new technology	1
for the price and features it is	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
is also expected but that is ok because all i need is something work with my iphone	0
and so far have not had problems with dvds not being able to play	1
price	1
the software has nt a hassle for at all	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
sharp picture and for my desk	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
i it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb with no extra shipping the monitor at my door in the time got from work tuesday	1
great colors pictures	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player probably the best there	1
takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb have timed it rrb which nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour that about as bad as it gets sometimes it without rebooting	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one was now working fine	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
the only thing m concerned about the quality longevity the buttons the thing	0
range is the best it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to on computer speakers	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
showed that were comparable to those of my home wireless router when my home broadband cable modem	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
connection speed the other machines awesome much quicker than the router i replaced when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus makes for a great product	1
one bad thing is that it comes a mb compactflash card and for most purposes it not enough	0
having considerable with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
i wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good the range is what you might expect speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
looks fantastic	1
they are clears perfect to be used along with a sub	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
bottom line for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the keyboard is very nice and quite comfortable although does take getting	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
maybe is my lack of experience but found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
without to through the through the isp taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can activate the speakerphone feature person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
i was willing to live but the durability was a zero	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
love and would probably go with creative labs again	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the software on the router is pretty	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
software to use	1
it is more than days and it does not the picture no matter what i do	0
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
also does nt voice activated dialing	1
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
overall an excellent phone	1
but it seems to work so well now i do anticipate any problems with it	1
the backlight the phone goes off way too quickly there is no way to change this	0
the player usually plays dvd is but occasional problems such as recognizing a dvd a particular point in every time we played it not being to access certain special features a rental dvd	0
its far heavier and much larger might not seem to matter except if use it while or keep it in your pocket	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
it also has unproven battery life	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
i because i read was the best deal for the money	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
works perfectly for my office	1
and this is could	1
it is to use a beginner like me but of for me	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
it is just such a nice light intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1

the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
however it failed to deliver on quality	0

for the price it is a well spent investment	1

another point the battery life is incredible	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1

the volume	0
this system is very powerful	1

the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with windows home professional otherwise other netbooks with nt allow and nobody mention this	1

the within minutes of opening i was out and about to any one	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
what is added in functionality in build quality as the face plate is to off	1
the g had focusing in and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the had been released a few seconds	0
usb is incredibly easy	1

no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
and i dropped it still works fine this little camera has have nt even gotten yet	1
reason rated it a four is of its very small and so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1

you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
the build quality is top notch	1
the only minor have with the camera are it fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0

it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
i like is color better but it not terribly flashy	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
i thought the was decent enough was complicated to learn at all	1
i bought phone trip south africa and it almost perfectly	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
well backlit keypad	1
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
in short if you just someone that is little afraid of technology and just a router to get online do basic networking play mafiawars and this router	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
i with online print ordering with the two major us brick mortar retailers they delivered great results	1
keep it short this cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1

price	1
key	1
i was surprised how good the sound was i especially like it when am listening to audio books	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
delivery was prompt	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
you can do different with it as choose what of now playing interface can see the interface as modern or classical	1
a few inconveniences one is that songs do automatically play like on a cd	0
was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in with the files	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an fm phone and earpiece	1
however speed reliability power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
it came well packaged	1
easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
i got this it is a great gift	1
i love that it a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the price the lowest i d research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1

you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
good battery life	1
there is also adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
controls are on the side instead of the front which i like because is where my when i hold thing	1
the color screen is plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the price size and features you can t	1
build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine playing discs the picture and sound is top notch	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on remote control which is one of simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever or used	1

the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
our special friends at creative gave thing sound quality great features long battery life and	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
this system is very powerful	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i m very pleased with my zx so is a quick review	1
neither message was answered	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1

fixed speaker cable why do this	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can a ton of songs	1
main dial is not backlit	0
great phone i d buy another	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it has trouble playing dvd movies	0
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
i love the fact i can carry it in and forget about it	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect of the small you insert in the ear cavity	0
about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is	0
this product too for normal use	0
stop looking this is the best n router you will lrb this on nov rrb	1
lrb yeah like you ll use new very expensive modem dumb bridge i returned the item got a linksys modem	0
of use and it longer anything	0
a doubt i that these speakers have as the jbl on stage and truly portable lrb can played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the pictures are razor	0
the software and has with other which	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned down but it is because these are computer speakers	0
works great	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
this so many capabilities that ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	0
am pleased with it so far	1
i attempted to connect unit to several different tvs using a of connection methods and i still can t get from the machine	0
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and	0
these speakers have great sound will buzz if leave them on with the sound turned up	1
i m so here is	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i can see between this monitor dell ultrasharp terms of contrast brightness viewing angles	0
it wo nt play of my movies all	0
despite that i so far i could live with this item since it me from lugging a case in the car etc	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
finally reiterate for t mobile as a carrier	0
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
venture to say that it is low cost it the best pc stereo set there costwise	1
connect to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
look fantastic	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the storage capacity is great	1
pause songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	0
this player was everything expected to be an affordable multi format dvd player as	1
paid more amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due and expected get a good quality product these random disconnects it me	0
finally can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
mediasource is an application serious user flaws	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
the canon software for raw images not present you with a raw image all the raw image after has processed by the	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
fantastic little computer everything had work study travel	1
canon is g does it	0
wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
i ready to pay the shipping return the speakers the day i got	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially you listen to a variety of genres as it adjust the you which can be a big	1
the battery life takes time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and is no delay between songs	1
third the poor design continues with the	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork having just dropped the for this router i was very unimpressed	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share in an intimate	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
it and seems be one of the best	1
i ve had the nomad	1
speakers are incredibly amazing	1
if want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful camera	1
you can manage your change the contrast of backlight make different of display either list or tabbed	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
the only downside the remote which requires a line of sight	0
and elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful does it it can also be used zoom and review pictures	1
in other words zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy capacity you need for your music collection	0

it	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it	0
the quality is superb	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i is the extreme obtainable with these point and shoot digicams f	1
the cover that came with it did nt fit very	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the grain was terrible	0
too to change genre track information for of tracks	0
for the price it	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0

if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
propietary headset jack	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the manual mode is easy to with fast access the selection of shutter speed and aperture without to fumble	1

when a lot of plastic where there metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
the infrared a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer old phone book this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to i got far enough to try this	0
i it day and i have to charge every or or so	0
because other people that about this player are talking bull this player is awesome breaks fast which is horrible	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0

one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
the woofer is much larger	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over ipod touchpad	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
the main problem the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb the software	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the has function which utterly useless	0
what do nt like is that at lower volume listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
the set up and offers a superior result	1
despite its being than the ipod i must say i was surprised to how small it was when i unwrapped the	1
the speakers have very rich sound and good bass also obviously for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the canon software for images does not present with the raw image after it processed all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
tech support was pleasent and helpfull once you someone	1

item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
usb means fast data transfers	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i also running in insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands this thick wire perfectly through the bottom of the base	1
without a doubt i would say that have the same sound quality as the on and are lrb can played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the installation software crashed several times and had reboot my pc at least twice not fun	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with is that it will lock up at odd	0

after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0

one complaint the screen is scratched	0
those used to mm cameras will the g very comfortable and friendly to	1
the theory but upon enabling the guest network working	0
a great system at an incredible price	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
well does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0

i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
while and have decent is with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
