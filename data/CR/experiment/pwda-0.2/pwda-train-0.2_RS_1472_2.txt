it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
because other people are it about player this that which this player is awesome complain just breaks fast talking bull is horrible	1

the well focus performs dummy but and love having the optional scene modes actually are auto proof i correspond to to situations in which i would they seek many use the camera	1
things are much rrb distinct like i and nt have to my my eyes and squint when i am trying to with something on the old lrb do i had read do to strain clunky screen monitor more	1
for apex money the machines have good features	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0

is then that it other a fantastic display for the price	1
is x zoom nice	1
i try navigating past a chapter to via the menu would it and nt do it	0

otherwise a monitor decent very for its price	1
setting leaving it on the default even produces crystal clear playback	1
i looked this item buying of that be more than the standard seemed an inexpensive dvd player features and into set to had the best in that category	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
this always so many capabilities that you for evolve have room ll new technologies as they has	1
frame freezes and the family with the dvd player dad somethings wrong quick come yells	0
incredible nearly pictures i have found that pictures nikon takes after this	1
easy line well made camera bottom to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
the scroll wheel me easy to use and works is for great however is have complained that the wheel many cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
we anytime to made changes with it enabled the router we on the gui one manually press the turn on radio button had the front of the router because to would nt work	0
and the sound well is no complaints about that there	1
picture great	1
is it overall the best camera on the market	1

it really impressed the with the disign me specs the price	1
the is excellent except there a tad too quiet at times when the sound quality are quieter talkers on maybe other end of the line	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
all in all has for a very good option is anyone who this a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	0
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1

my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1

works it great	1
connection speed seems the other machines plus awesome much quicker than the router i replaced combined when and with to of the valet the simplicity this makes for a great product	1
it also has excellent two story through our coverage house	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1

flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
they deliver great sound and hooked up when actually receiving a signal	1
still i was a myriad as this unit looks sleek and willing to overlook those things has of features	1
i unreservedly recommend the powershot to g any potential buyer period for a first class digital out better there is no at a reasonable price camera camera there looking	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0

i m very so with my zx pleased here is a quick review	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
set up easy to very	1
the zoom goes which the magnification up and down is nice but there is always viewing display of in about one quarter from down of the way the zoom size top of the screen that interferes with a at most settings	0
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the controls are the on side when where which i like because that is on the front my thumb is instead of i hold the thing	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i have service many times of get a hold lonely apex constantly does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is extremely overworked busy as the one to customer who rep is probably tried	0
as to for a cellphone i was it determined going buy a nokia only while fully is the best in cellphones	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was no to return the product at able loss on my part	1
the contrast be beat nt readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca and crispness	1
it sounds night out on the patio or great my on stand	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
it would button been much nicer if it you a window had so could and the screen see if the have did nt cover up the ac jack	0

there the goes up and down in magnification which is nice but viewing is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way from down the top of the screen that interferes with zoom settings most at	0
the scroll button depressing is not always responsive	0
simply the canon at is the best digital camera today out there g this price point	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
in fact others say not bright enough	0
many of our disney movies this dvd player nt play on do	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0

just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
does is which not t work along several long stretches on that same route	1
a is the camera dream priority priority but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture operate in automode shutter to and manual modes	1
the zooming lever is shaky does not operate mechanically hope it i otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
they re pretty comfortable quality in place deliver and a decent audio stay	1
than my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower with while standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
not is recognize player at random times despite being connected and does player displaying library	0
the compact digital camera is and around you have little children if especially useful the can always take you camera with you and take pictures many of them	1
house personally would recommend this router in hold i every or small buisiness environmnets	1
is thing missing from creative only a cd burner	0
the to no direct firewire camera	0
if you small looking for a re with super resolution compact camera you can end your search digital the nikon	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
even with these shortcomings i still is it think the best digital under available camera	1
upon opening these be having them to i really small but found a solid feel to them	1
the changing colors help to glance with a quick tell	1
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
the sorting then files is easy as pie	1
the tiny remote unit it wonderful not only does to trigger the is shutter can also be used it zoom and review pictures	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
this but is in the zen manual documented not neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
this wonderful product was easy unbox and install to	1
size small	1
find it too bright i	0
very good value for the money	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
and love this player i would probably go with creative labs again	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
it looking small light and nice the and is display is decent as well	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
plug not play relies on id no fm or recording	0
this phone has as ir just to many other features one the features above i view the name most beneficial	1
i for this phone bought my trip to worked africa and it south almost perfectly	1
the second set working is just fine	1
it is easy re to pop it open what see to song you enough listening to	1
the keyboard does also and nice very quite comfortable although it is take some getting used to	1
excellent heavy of quality and the stands fairly build blend are not imposing well into the rest and my furniture	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
does it run quite hot to tend and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
no dropouts good signal story all over my three strength house lrb unit is on the located and rrb top floor very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
to is large defined and easy read the screen and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
pictures wo nt transfer the included transfer cable directly the camera from using to pc	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
when the poor to fair the was nt contracting or glitching overall picture quality was screen	0
fine worked	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
the software was great as long as have an adminstrative user account you	1
no matter the format	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
purchased did nt i one in which i a have of reviews put in batteries myself lrb i is would rrb i did alot of research and read a pain bunch to and that m glad want i these speakers	1
also tax was only with free no and shipping it so overall it is a decent player	1
with mediasource being so easy i bundled no use for the found nomad explorer software	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
it with impressed me really the the disign specs the price	1
standard was very prompt this shipping service	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
the service very good is from t mobile too	1
the remote capture and software fileviewer bundled for is mind blowing capture photo	1
easy did not work but it enough	0
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple i ago very months have so far and satisfied with it been	1
mediasource an application is with serious user interface flaws	0
nt do buy this monitor	0

i bar not the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery single used even go down one did ve	1
love this feature simply i	1
also i not t the cds why the software when can ignore the does it lists understand in alphabetical order	0
i was looking for life and good battery portability delivers this product and both	1
after got two phones for the t mobile family plan weeks one came with a broken headphone and one died today we less than two and of use	0
both units are with small similarly small speakers	1
both the black and the white it are economically priced and worth speakers	1
clears are they and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
this monitor love i	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
does rocks my socks my beer spills but the gb zen xtra nt wash my car	1
ripping my even with the songs usb connection is still very quick very good the quality is and	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
best electronic i since bought ve i was born	1
nokia and t mobile up teamed really well on this baby	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
quite hot does tend to it run and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
the larger on has me allowed to put all my photos on it the could nt screen rrb dell lrb and edit them	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
if you re for a quality tower speaker looking this is it	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
sounds overall small great less and expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
i also did nt you the way the screen like information way down into it when displayed are in zoom mode	0
unit dropouts good signal strength located over my three story and no is all on the top floor rrb house lrb very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1

this camera also and a great feel has weight to it	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
i quickly got can use to the interface find to and any song playlist etc fast enough	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
it came back working and rumors momentarily was glad that the i i did heard nt d about acer tech support turn out to be true in my case	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
was very large and readable the lcd screen	1
the windows premium recommend starter rrb good user do nt is and lrb friendly	1

fine worked	1
and did nt think find would i this quality i ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
also i have not had vbr mp cds reading svcds trouble i created and that	0
nothing hassle with this company but	0
customer service are of their products nonresponsive and overloaded and support tells you about the quality technical and their willingness to stand behind them	1
although the nokia is a little to on the features department doing is an outstanding short of hardware for what it it primarily was meant to do piece be a wireless telephone	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
it a nice color screen has	1
we with well pleased are the monitor and the company	1
proven canon lens quality and built	1
of zennx is replaceable battery was the over ipod factor in my purchase zennx deciding	1
the poor design third continues with the case	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
with more i have about songs gb of storage with room for about on the player	1
for gave is zen stars because it is excellent the it class it is in and the class that not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different i	1
easy to the device is so connection	1
the rate plans least also at very good are for me	1
is the picture clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
what plate added in functionality detracts in build is as the face quality is prone to popping off	0
it a jvc is amazing that was years old and had thought i was good but the onkyo sound system	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
the pictures are a learning curve to it and their is fabulous have nt even gotten to are tons of features i there	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
control addition it comes with a remote in	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
my overall experience monitor this with was very poor	0
a and good build the player comes chic look in compact form with a metal face plate	1
my gut portable me the nomad will to buy products from again be worst best a gb never hard drive albeit one tells which i can t create folders or at at a very expensive lesson in companies on in the long run	0
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
after months it playing stoppped higher number scenes on dvds	0
with are well pleased we the monitor and the company	1
sound best in class	1
unlike a lemon of the other people my received some who dvd player came in perfect working condition	0
is as also not as high the sound level i would have expected	0
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
this camera has to cool stitch a feature pictures find out more just log on to canon is website	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
this phone is qualities as a whole and is or like others with one good two not great	1
the sound is great the volume out is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting and external noise	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not indicated bad as some reviewers as have	0
you can barrel the lens see in the view finder	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
router on the the software is pretty good	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
feedback on all the company is products is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to creative	0
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent is fact that cheaper than is replacable is excellent and finally the price the battery the gb ipod excellent the	1
overall i am will and very satisfied with this product be using it often	1
after and seeing i the sound of the i tour pop speaker hearing was sold	1
we got this on time and it be brand new perfect condition performance m can was so keep in mind i comes extremely computer savvy expected for the machine specifications my opinion as to a lot of people	1
is one downside though that autofocus does not battery well when work is low	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
its ability to my music collection as a back up for plus is a huge serve	1
is included earpiece the very comfortable and easy to use	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
great and everything are the colors	1
not a bad monitor it but for is nothing special	1
looks good	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
the explorer down shut did program a open times while i nt renaming titles and changing genres but i did just again to reboot the computer or anything was couple up explorer have	0
technical support line support buffalo very helpful the line on the other hand was technical	1
material is on the cheap side	0
i do but this overall phone like unforutnately i am returning it	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
i d out to say that because it is low cost there it is the best pc stereo set venture of costwise	1
for there the price is nothing better	1
my region one dvds read though would not the any of unfortunately even player they were not damaged in any way	1
i have had a for mine month to and have say now i have enjoyed it	1
the camera of a wonderful set has features	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
jack that i miss are and dialing voice activated a standard mm headset other things	0
very easy to use buttons and interface are the	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
the buttons on for the are small even phone my rather quickly fingertips but you get used to them small	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1

also the lens cap design is flawed	0
the second lasted about two weeks the before video went out	0
it it easy to use beginners for but has into that more serious photographers will love features is is an excellent camera to grow so	1
there are lots of interesting features included eax such as and customization	1

infuriating setup process interface is the and the for the nomad with the player is sub par	0
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
one easily the screen is too complaint scratched	0
mp my fiance optical zoom a lot absolutely all photos last that challenges beautiful of the above mp cameras add on options to understand and use and of features not least easy comes with great software and with detail but by far takes received x is stamp of approval	1
it would spin some more spin read and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
os the firmware and or quite simply the that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
sound is as clear and the bass very deep is crystal well	1
also the carrying case the side controls came with mine covers up the display so even though to display i have to are reachable it up that see the open	1
mentioned is that digital unit has both optical and coax the audio outputs though the latter was not another nice thing in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
this apex will model not work with my universal remote control	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the in is i d tag program editing a strong point as well	1
to dwl ap as not work does a repeater for di s and there is no firmware support this product my update	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
there neither picture nor sound was	0
excellent is hours beats ipod battery life	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
definitely more capable of filling the room computer than any with sound other speakers i ve owned	1
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
battery life the drawback k reeves to quote to most digital cameras	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
nice is very solidly built and feel a it dense has to it	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
and a great player that blows the i pod away with easy understand use and to features software that is simple understand to all in all this use and a great sound	1
wo a lot play nt of discs	0
it worked from the picture at which time to failed completely	0
the backlight it periodically fail in will happened i sent it the first time for warranty repair	0
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
even bass rather is pretty impressive from such the small drivers	1
the dvd player is fine	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
focusing its system is also very flexible	1
highly recommend point hard to beat at this price this monitor	1
for the cost of this product ask could not i for more	0
the screen are unlimited and ring tones is bright	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
x is nice zoom	1
i but of time less than a month is not an acceptible period work for something to loved it until it broke	0

one beef is does it the scroll nt work d like well as i as	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
some movies it played yesterday it wo play nt today	0
the battery is out better alot most of the phones than there	0
however the main reason i am not is lock up at odd times this product satisfied the fact will it that with	1
i m channels i ll probably front more for the buy very happy with these	1
i and as bunch of different formats to see if it did play tried it would	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
is think apex i the best player dvd you can get for the price	1
the zen stores data files but does not to nor allow it does from to be launched or programs allow a folder structure be opened documents its disk	0
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
the problem with this box times that it reboots if is an hour several not more frequently	0
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
my wife is even more pleased due to widescreen its	1
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
works was acquired and monitor as promised with my newly easy to set up nvidia glasses	0
well within days the video output quit working	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
the sound quality has it poor since day one been constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some short of sort circuit the we can no longer use with base in the base the ac adapter or the base turns off completely	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
but the sound is on my portable speakers and works well very good	1
nt is a fun do gadget little it expect high definition sound	0
overall the g delivers be must a considered the from image quality of any current megapixel digicams best what detail tonal and balance color response point of view	1
fantastic looks esp w iphone docked	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
will i never this machine all the whistles and bells use is capable of	1
the is good is clear bright and sharp the sound and picture	1
monitors these are great for the price	1
in any case navigation to is ok miss i however an ability by artist album navigate by folders	0
after years with that carrier horrible customer service portability expensive plans and is heaven seemed sent	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
i what nt know the other people are saying but do software is awesome	1
the remote use flimsy feeling and awkward to is	0
as a portable player it more feel a bit should durable	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
this is for to have wonderful your first dvd player	1
the main problem with the nomad zen is xtra gb jukebox the software	0
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
the pictures razor sharp are even in macro	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
this is a great camera for you	1
great storage capacity is the	1
shortly very died after getting them	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
on the cheap side is material	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
having for makes usb very fast transfers	1
compared most definately everything else in this category this to is the best bang for the buck	1
reasonably consistent suffers from construction quality poor product support of the scroll wheel using difficulty and creative zen feedback feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
have xmass the player since had and love it	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
is battery the alot better than most the of phones out there	0
looked just right the price performance	1
multiple play modes tracks not order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players worth but noting that the zen xtra is in deficient in this matter	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
difficult navigation i wo nt say difficult necessarily but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i to tried these speakers found them and preform well below expectations for this price	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking the the whole screen they one has scroll to down one by one or them memorized where to are in the menu order and select have by using up number keypad	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
can is wonderful not only does it to the shutter it the tiny remote unit be also used trigger zoom and review pictures	1
nice and small and excellent when to comes it downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
they and are very sturdy oddly no trouble balance wise or handling have shaped speakers	1
for me its for and the quality perfect more than and word docs is games acceptable	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
both units are speakers with similarly small small	1
the phone small is light and very attractive	1
it the most bang is for the buck out there	1
i having nt the would an of the house adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and mind speed floor the bottom on external is much improved	1
amazing are the picturers	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
i find the lack of this phone games on entertaining quite disturbing	0
the speakerphone works better any speakerphone than i ve ever had	1
and nice compact	1
but if looking re you the apex dvd player my opinion of for i love it	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
trash thing is this	0
phone this is highly recommended otherwise	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
can that i own it however i now t imagine being without it	1
i should about trusted all the online comments ve the of repair team terrible acer	0
i ve had this thing for less than and month never it quite well a dropped it is the headphone jack treated all screwed up	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up at all we router nt losing to re set the have disk so is since wireless far the business added is my wife no longer giving me delivery about had her on internet benefits it her laptop so security connection neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
i immediately had to getting the player problems recognize two of my favorite dvds	0

ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0

fast is easy to use with the manual mode menu for the selection of shutter having and aperture without options to fumble through access speed	1
would nt buy because of the customer service again	0
lastly benefit feel unless the speakers were over priced for i i got lrb that there is some inherent what in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
which there raw one more complaint i have about the g raw image mode that is the shoot that comes with a for replace is images i only to in and and the first thing i did was processing the mbyte cf with it opposed cf now gives me raw images as mbyte software	0

i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
again the and were spot on front projected from where they should the sounds of the tv	1
apparently t mobile back heavily t logged and can is keep up with demands	0
this has so many for that evolve ll always have room you new technologies as they capabilities	0
convenience through the usb port it works because	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
unfortunately it can t all of the dvd play	0
the features really are cool like the radio	1
price is a fantastic camera it well worth the and	1

color screen is good	1
fragile	0
the scene mode in a regular setting well going the remainder of shots that are not for to be works	1
when now through its fine but have i gone works two monitors it both with defective switches	0
when you continues on your were turning it off the player turns on really fast and left music turn when play as you the it to you player	1
i wished that a little bit could make the volumn they louder	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i easy found on the interface a computer the nomad is very have a use if you have to basic knowledge of that	0
nt was dissapointed that acer was i more helpful	0
i nt sent my other dvd movies back to apex because it wo have play certain disney and ad	0
there with year within are problems a my menu dial knob	0
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
i giving this player cautious recommendation m	1
is material on the cheap side	0
and hate apex but love amazon i i tell everyone	0
complaint only significant my is sound quality	0
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
the player flawed are also is mechanics	0
i but and they helped me install new firmware called the tech support this did not solve the problem	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
overall i it like	1
in addition comes it with a sleek and powerful headset	1
they could but more comfortable be no complaints in the sound department	1
bought is ok to rip catalog you if before are and but i used musicmatch to rip my cds burn music i creative mediasource software the zen starting from scratch guess what	0
i do it but care for gracenotes genre listings always nt allows easy editing of id tags	1
i try tell d myself my experiences but the router waiting this go back to the store to i never got far enough to you so	0
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
ones are much inferior to the simple ipod the controls	0
router negotiated the speed just fine and presented the the switch with a gige link	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
as it stands now the case is up unless you re packing the player pretty useless for travel or if up load you all your beforehand songs	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
flawlessly works it during installation of cx	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
very line well made features easy to use camera flexible lense filters powerful bottom to include the ability to use external flash and and choices	1
failed time d link support was more helpful and guided to to the actual problem which this that the router was me auto negotiate fios from my the ethernet link speed optical network block	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
find i it too bright	0
i had load problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to no onto songs albums and this unit	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
i hate apex but tell everyone and i love amazon	0
is great the storage capacity	1
while the ease off paid amazon for this player was very impressive i was of put by the price about more than what i use	1
possibly is biggest advantage this player has the the fact that the user can by the battery replace him herself opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
dsub main that for me is problems the the cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
the auto focus performs well but i would and the optional scene modes i they dummy proof having correspond to many situations use are love actually seek to in which the camera	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
it does look nt pretty spending this of of course cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down kind	0
great features	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
did nt wanted the product to work bad soo but it just i	0
for the money apex machines have good features	1
overall an excellent phone	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
small size	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
i ve tried play great all of these discs and they all playing	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1

this to is good mode to integrate my clarion cx product toyota my camry enough	1
into phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits falling nicely any pocket without this out	0
the sound quality unit the is excellent looks cool screen and bright easy is to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
cameras the quote to most digital battery life to drawback k reeves	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs than the nomad jukebox to be much using faster and to easier windows explorer	1
no up wpa with set problems	0
setup software for my application on found the setup software i the enclosed cd to be useless	0
is easy it	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
this nicest one of the is electronic ve ever owned that i devices	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
exceptional was the service from the supplier	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
this system is very powerful	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1

so if you re game you for a little fiddling may pleased very be with this day forecaster	1
i them these speakers and found tried to for well below expectations preform this price	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0

granted but have only used for it player for about hours setting dvd up for mom my for christmas find that was long enough this i to me problems with this dvd player	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices player for good achievement hard drive based a	1
changing that leave easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i is brightness at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
elsewhere read what ive to contrary the g does sync does of a second with third party flashes just the dedicated flashes it at with as from canon	0
at an incredible price a great system	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
recharge stays charged for a long ac and takes no more than or hours at most to adapter the battery via the included time fully	1
nt feel to my favorite music station it put i next to me when i went to bed just to listen got this phone and the handset itself i the first night weight anything its too light and does so comfy with it	1

the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1

the lack on i of entertaining games find this phone quite disturbing	0

the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
the had dvd player which a faulty power supply nd caused to occasionally not turn on	0
at me the end what wanted i was a large capacity player which allows is to and play any album from xtra wherever i go and the my collection zen of the day combination of price capacity easily features easily meets those criteria	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
i fully expect it pretty go have pointed out again in the same or some other way in the next months the construction other reviewers bad because as is to flimsy	0
a travesty enough said is the scroll bar	0
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
capacity storage	1
technology wise this think this is awesome plus i makes it even great the speaker love i phone	1
with up wpa set no problems	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1

my dad also and an apex tv has it was another great value the money for	1

the phone book is very user friendly and excellent is speakerphone the	1
and as a breeze work netbook for fast it worked fine my sales person better with the nothing ram extra could stop it in fact it works the than my own laptop so i will change soon as to this one as possible	0

i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
very happy with the monitor the and price	1
the only it fairly boxy i have instead a bit slow minor is nits looking it a a wrist strap with the camera of needs neck strap and it is are between shots	0
i guess that it lifetime may means limited warranty take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
like i overall the unit	1
are surprisingly quick through usb transfers	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
this is long battery life very light phone a than less little oz with a	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
after months it playing stoppped higher number scenes on dvds	0
strongly would i recommend this product	1
woofer the is much larger	1
this early a nice feature no e it the morning is in you and is rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal i problem	1
