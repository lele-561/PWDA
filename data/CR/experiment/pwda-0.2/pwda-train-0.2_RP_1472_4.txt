bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features make this player one of the best on the market	1
i tried to send them a mailing and they come back saying undeliverable	0
but canon never fails to disappoint	1
despite the things that i have read so far i can live with it since it saves me from lugging a heavy bag from the car to work to the gym in the morning etc	1
it s great and for the price you can t beat it	1
i have to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there cost wise	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
i like the look of this little critter	1
the international has done a great job on all of these equipment and produces crystal clear images with excellent clarity and clarity	1
i love it and it is a great gift	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items are always in great shape	1
you are on the left side of the device which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand it is a neccessary lil device	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
they will not answer the phone and the phone line is constantly busy	0
i will start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
you can download it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
months of hard work and it no longer recognizes anything	0
well flash photos are not great and there was still a lot of noise	0
this really is a great phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great battery life and its cheap	1
i love it but unforutnately i am returning it	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a price tag and for most people it is not enough	0
the sound quality is very good	1
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
great minds	1
this is my first digital camera and what a great camera it is	1
the player is intuitive and outputs a very good sound quality	1

i remain very pleased with this router	1
i am doing this for just and there is no end to what i can do for just	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
the dvd player is disabled	0
after using it for just a month i could not play any games	0
paid more than what amazon is charging and they are selling this router at a price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and amazon are trying to get a good quality product these random disconnects are making it impossible	0
im on mine	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for a few months since i picked it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to have problems with it	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
surfing the web at night is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages like this	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
price gb	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
it is small light and compact looking and the display is decent too	1
the picture is very bright and sharp and the quality of the sound is good	1
the design is sleek and the color is good and the screen has good resolution	1
the pictures are razor sharp too	1
have used it for years and have had no problems	1
i did not expect to make creative nomad explorer friends	1
after seeing and listening to the music of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
also the display is very light and it can be used in a variety of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
the interface was atrocious several elements simply didnt work	0
i did the same thing with the same software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
i keep trying and it keeps telling me no disc	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound quality	1
it worked great for about a week then the problems came	1
i expected the image quality of the digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size and up to fine quality the results are quite impressive	1
i could tell this was a cheap system as soon as i set it up	0
one downside though is that it does not work as a flashlight when battery is low	0
the remote capture and editing software bundled for photo and video editing is mind blowing	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with this and i love the colors and the way they change across the panel when i move from the center to the edges	1
i got this thing for my birthday and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
i love it	1
the only problem that i have with it is that it does not access the internet at all	0
the d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router was trying to auto set the ethernet link speed from my home network to the optical network i was using that was annoying	1
the only thing i have is the clicker on my keyboard which is stiff	0
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
lastly i would say that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some sort of discount in the bose label that i do not know of rrb	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to have something like this around instead of stacks of cds or dvds	1
i needed three batteries to charge myself for a week with the s but the battery pack is a real powerhouse	1
i think youll love this feature	1
the only thing i dont like about is the lack of longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
the canon eos d mark ii is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few months and its been of use to me	0
also you can get unlimited data for free which is a plus for all you people who dont want to pay for data just to say you have an ipod do nt know that this is a much better buy	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving event and really like it good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am touching it or turning it and turning it again	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the quality of the materials used and of the nikon optics	1
there is also a small window so it is very low to the desk	0
another point of note the battery life is excellent	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
color screen is not available	0
i am ncercat	0
i was able to talk on the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the ihome is not perfect but it is clearly superior	1
the remote camera and fileviewer that comes bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is that	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is not a display of the zoom size so you have to scroll down from the top of the screen and that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
this is cool	1
i have been playing minecraft for many years and multi tasking is not new and while it does take time the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
it is a good place to look for all the dvds i have and rented	1
this is awesome	1
battery life is unknown	0
i will be able to use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
i need this monitor	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point of mine as well	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps to be able to do that	1
this router is phenomenal	1
it sounds harsh but i would estimate you would get maybe of the same response that you would from a true fan out jack	0
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
how to hook up	1
the excels as a cell phone is a god	1
the sound is crystal clear sound with excellent clarity the audio engineer has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr has done an excellent job	1
when the radio was working it was great but	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt been able to get to all of them yet	1
best in class sound	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the sound is surprising full with a good amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
changing the brightness is easy with four presets and i leave it at i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does not make that big of a difference	1
now there is only one thing i have to say about this camera and that is that i only use with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot to anyone who is looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
because of it is hidden features i dont think this is the best way around to watch non american region it is	1
unfortunately it can t play that way	0
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
the downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery life is low	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
the quality of the lcd screen is great	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
navigation could be improved but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
solid resistant to corrosion and better heat dissipation	1
i am impressed with how easy this app is to use	1
it plays basically every video that i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped a few years ago and the rental dvd that should nt be playing on it	1
i am unreservedly the powershot g to say that if you are looking for a first class digital camera at this price there is no better camera out there period	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
the color red is a common color as are the polyphonic ringtones	0
chic look and good build quality and it comes in a compact form with a metal finish on the front plate	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
i can give this phone to anyone anytime	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of work for doing what it was designed to do to be a great telephone	1
the rate plans are also very good for the environment at least for me	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the slimmest of viewing angles are excellent	1
it plays every dvd i ve tested so far even an old dvd that i ripped years ago and the only dvd on my dvd player that could nt be played was the one on my old sharp player	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
it did nt work corectly from the start and the battery lasted about a week and a half before it started to die he said	0
the top that covered the battery compartment kept poping off without any warning and there was a bit of a touch near the bottom latch	0
how to hook up	1
you can be very far away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
this player is an ideal candidate	1
it has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
getting access to the device is so easy	1
the sun was about feet away in a brightly lit room but during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in shades of orange	0
you can see the lens barrel here	1
the operation with the increased memory option was not compatible with the windows home professional instaled the windows starter with windows starter software and nobody mention this	0
it came well packaged	1
difficult navigation i wo nt want to say difficult but i do not enjoy the scrollwheel to much	0
i bought this one for myself at christmas because it had good reviews as a good value for the money on a lot of different sites	1
the hinge on the display is hinged and it can be used in a myriad of positions or to protect it against damage photo istock	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i got both	1
they have a number of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of the food	0
only thing that keeps me from creative is a cd burner	0
the functionality of this app is mind blowing	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
i cant believe the size and weight of this little critter	0
it is just such a nice light weight non battery powered device which you can use anywhere	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i think the main reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
in addition it comes with	1
i ve used it and it is the best thing i ve ever bought and used ever	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
this phone is great as a phone and is not like any other phone with one or two good qualities	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not allow me to read certain dvds	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
we bought this router for our two computers but it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re wondering if we should get a new one	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb drive to your computer and have it connected to accessible storage	1
in other words the price is not a good indicator of your data storage capacity you can only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
the zoom goes up and down a lot but there is a problem with a display that is about one third of the way down from the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
great product works great for my office	1
what the hell is going on with this thing	0
despite most reviewers giving a thumbs up to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using it	0
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1

lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like a winamp with the options	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1

the excels as a cell phone thank you	1
what a sweet machine	1
text fitch rating was positive	1
while my laptop and netbook have speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers so it is hard to hear some of the music	0
my house is very small so it is hard to see the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
you ca nt your decision is irreversible	0
the canon g gives you a lot of options for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it easy for the novice photographer	1
ring tones only come with one ring so there is only one ring that sounds good to me	0
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about minutes for a cd on my pentium with x drive	1
the colours are a bit off and the layout is a bit funky in relation to the other rooms but it is not too weird	0

both units are small with similarly small arms	1
this is an excellent device especially for those who want something with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1

i am still in awe of this camera canon and how it puts enormous quality into the g	1
screen brightness is	1
the software is very easy to use and i could use it when i was out and about and to any one of my friends	1
excellent and i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
at the end of the day what i was looking for was a large capacity player which would allow me to take with me any game from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily	1
the weather was terrible	0
p p p p does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
the service is excellent except for being a tad too quiet at times when there are other passengers on the other end of the line	1
and as long as amazon has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
i think it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much i like it	0
the monitor works as expected with a sharp and bright display	1
lots of flaws but exceptional build quality hd size and build quality make it a good buy	1
the switch was set to the speed just fine and presented me with a gige link	1
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
the aff feature did not work when converting the image to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	0
it will download and play all cd audio disc	1
so yes as with all software that was released it was useless and ugly	0
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
do you want to buy this monitor	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing and for those who are very much for a computer speaker rrb this is not necessary	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
this camera is closest to perfect than anything that is out there	1
player is not working i had to install nomad explorer on my computer and use it to transfer files and i had a hard time as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the files into it	0
otherwise this is awesome	1
we ve purchased so far all claiming to work as dvd players and none have worked	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have a good grip you should be able to handle it	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to watch a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of not being able to get the player to do it properly	0
the main problem with the nomad and the zen xtra system is the software	0
but when we got to the house there was sound but no picture	0
it is a great device if you are travelling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
it is not	1
typically the problem is the same jack it was before	0
to get the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you will have to go through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size i have to say that the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so	0
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
sound quality is good and i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
it would either not play the game at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was turned on or on my desk	0
it is like when it randomly comes back from the dead and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often and its really annoying	0
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
price	1
i have this monitor for a while now and i m very happy with it	1
the world itself has all sorts of problems	0
it is worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this regard it is in fact a part of the system etc is standard on all jukebox players but not	1
the auto focus is a bit slow but i like the fact that having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and can be applied to many situations in which i would actually like to use the camera	0
it takes approximately to an hour to come back to lrb i have nt been able to get it to work which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with the mms software which you will enjoy	1

it did also seem to have been around for some time	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
full capacity	1
all the latest acer stuff here	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is not my fault	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
no problems with dropped signals and no problems with the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
i am nt a fan of having an external tv antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is great	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
overall this camera is a very dependable and well built and useful little camera	1
fragile	0
with it enabled anytime we made a connection to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would not work	0
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
they are not the same	0
the prints are beautiful	1
after using it for about a month i can state for the record that it definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i find the apex ad to be very interesting	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to charge the battery while plugged in to the camera	1
the price performance of	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
and for the price this is the best phone one could have	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good vocals and well recored mp s	1

i tried it as bunch of different formats to see if it would work and it did	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i bought it because it looked easy to install	1

it also has a very useful tracking tool which can be found here and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
nice little car very light compact	1
the auto mode performs well but i dont mind having them as they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the auto mode	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is not always available	0
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does not work as it is supposed to	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the camera ready to shoot i was able to produce a lot of stopaction photos contrary to what i was expecting	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
speed and range speed	1
you can change your profile to show different types of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1

but when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen went blank im confused	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
the color is so beautiful and is so attractive	1
in fact it only seems to work if you re using it with a battery that has been drained from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
when you turn it on your player the light turns on really fast and the music starts to play just as fast as you turned off it when you were turning it off	1
all i can say is that this is a good thing	1
but dollar wise this dvd player is probably the best one out there	1
no direct access to the camera	0
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched it	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of its low priced calling plan and the fact that it has direct access to my corporate email	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
this is an excellent value	1
with this mp player you can listen to much more music for much less than an ipod	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair people for that because i tried to give you all the information i could	0
the sound quality is excellent and the volume is more than satisfactory for listening to music and shutting out external noise	1
the excellent polyphonic ringing tones are great and it also doubles as a radio which is a nice bonus when you are bored	1
i i d say this is a decent router for the money i d i d	1
i have had no problems with it	1
it has great battery life fm fm radio with signal strength free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1

the menu options are very limited as you can t have a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you want to do	0
having unfilled i d tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0

i have nothing against this laptop in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible it will work as a breeze for my sales person it is very easy to use and with the right	1
it has been said that they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products this is not true	0
i am going to miss my phone a lot	0
and i have extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a very loud speaker	0
the quality is excellent	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
my house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly i have good signal strength all over my three floors i am very happy in the setup and all aspects	1
i m sure it would be very useful and can be useful in situations where you would only need your voice to be at a whisper	1
the lack of capacity is great for me	0
i gave it only a few days to get used to the fact that the st one broke when i tried it from a fairly short distance	0
you can also assign special numbers and graphics to your phone to call people when they call	0
it does not work and it does not show the picture correctly	0

no fm or voice recording these would have been deleted	0
it has a lot more features and costs a lot less than the ipod	1
they look good	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim screen	1
connection speed is awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the speed of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
i do not know what other people are doing with this but the software is awesome	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and bass	1
it has a x optical zoom which is very useful for these situations	0
but i njeh	0
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0

the screen is very bright and easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1

the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
photographers will find the cameras auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1

this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1

unfortunately after loading the app all i get now is a message saying its either not connected or busy	0
this router does drop out once in a while but not like it did before	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
both the black and the white versions are economically priced and are well worth it	1
it is crystal clear	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
but i ve already spoken to creative tech support about it and gotten a promise that they will fix it for me if necessary	1

mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
it is not it	0
it also has a great feel and weight to it	1
audio is unavailable	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech was wrong the customer was led to believe what the tech said was wrong	0
the remote is a little hard to find	0
all in all this is a very good deal for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants to upgrade	1

i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my phone to load songs and albums onto my computer	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0

it did also seem to have been around for some time	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always use it so i did nt worry about it after all	1

not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a modern mobile phone user would want	1
no problems with dropped signals and no problems with the netgear that it replaced which only lasted months	1
making the cds was a bit time consuming but i think it would have been with the new system as well	0
it has a lot of good movies and very few bad ones	1
those who are used to mm cameras will find this very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i also did nt like the fact that it cuts the information way down on the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it doesnt work most of the time but there is a method for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just give up	0
this is my second creative use of mp player and it is definitely worth it	1
it has a hot shoe that can be used as an external flash and fortunately for me i already have a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
some people have problems with the flip switch but the button that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you are using it as the cover	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased to say that in six months it will cost a fraction of what i paid now but that is good enough for me	1
i used this monitor for years and now it works great with a mixture of various colors and de focused colors	1
simply the best camera out there today at this price point is the best digital camera out at today	1
it also does not have voice activated dialing big minus	0
people also have complained about the case not being in english but that is not really a problem because it seems to me that the case is in english and offers very good protection	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
the camera the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
the range is in the basement or in a basement four bars all the time	0
the only minor nits i have with it are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a belt instead of a shoulder strap and it is a little slow between the straps	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to external headphones or external speakers	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1

however since i am in an apartment i normally only listen to them at high volumes and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
overall i lira	1
i think it is quick easy to use i find the entire process very easily mastered	1
one last note i would like to mention that this comes with a higher price than what you can get in the states	1
the weather is nice	1
the sound quality is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is a speaker but i only use it when the display is off in which case you can see you own reflection on the screen	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
other then that it is very good for the price	1
the water is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you will get sick	0
for the money spent it is a well spent investment	1
and so far i have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
everything was going well until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
trumps instincts are razor sharp even in	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a good grip	0
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in the market	1
when the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
this book is highly recommended otherwise	1
it has a nice color screen	1
it may	1
i don t care if it can t play some of your real dvds what about the others	0
additional features	1
slow to download and install certain programs wish you the best and thanks for reading my review	0
weaknesses the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the zoom settings if you have a lot of mp s with really long names you will have to cycle through every zoom setting before the	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants to use it for music and external speakers	1
but then again it can be argued that i heard it ringing in my office when i was already out on the street	1
the keypad is a small size but the power on off key is large	1
it may	1
why the canon g is the best digital camera out there right now at this price point	1
theyre rude and unhelpful	0
great minds	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0

the world	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and good viewing angles of all colours good price	1

this player has worked really well for me and at this price you cant beat it	1
both of the problem dvd is that it would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept changing	0

the computer direct processing and shipping system	0
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get the same effect as the main flash with depth being lost	0

this is the best dvd i ve ever seen and i ve purchased	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be better off with a gb instead of a hard drive one on which i have no control or at worst invested in companies never to buy products from again	0

our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1

and it looks great too	1
player is not plug and play so i had to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to get it working and i had a be patient as i was used to having to download the music files and then download and install the music	0

finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
it has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	0
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
it is easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on features it comes with great software and apps but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval it is absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot several times which was not fun	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify the settings on the fly has a very fast rechargeable battery	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the left side of the player which is great for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
you can hear it in the background its loud enough to be heard but that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options such as priority lighting priority light metering etc etc but all controls are well thought out and and the user interface is relatively simple	1
its great	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is very bright and easy to read and use it is by no means a major advantage over the ipod	1
this is absolutely terrible	0
it does well in the world of internet browsing	1
its software and operating system is also very flexible	1
when i put it to the test for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker still worked and it was even out of doors	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible with the adapter unfortunately it does not provide mac support for the adapter itself	0
i have had it for a month now and have to say i have never been happier with it	0
i find the lack of security and privacy on this phone quite disturbing	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
i have just purchased the canon powershot for the first time and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
i followed the easy instructions on the website and once online at the router site there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you want to use it	1
only owned it for a month so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan or player of higher quality very soon	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
lightweight very light and portable	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
it does nt have a firewire card since most windows and computers do not generally have firewire cards themselves	0
i did nt want one because i thought i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that would be expensive but i did a lot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i am so glad i purchased these speakers	1
the mouse that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
nothing else	0
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
naturally i did a lot of research before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this thing is capable of	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
it has an offline option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the sound this slim design brings out	1
you ca nt that it is irreversible	0
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
so as usual as with all things that are bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
for the most part this year	1
well this dvd player is turning out great	1
however the wifi on this new router worked of the time	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
i tried called them but no help	0
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
connection speed to the car seems awesome much quicker than the car i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great experience	1
i bought this slick phone and i am loving it	1
the problem is much larger	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i was a bit surprised that he was able to step me thru manual setup	1
cameras are a big plus on this camera	1
the computer direct from the manufacturer and shipping was outrageously fast	1
it is crystal clear	1
it is easy enough to leave it open to see what song you are currently listening to	1
sound quality and base is excellent	1
im happy everything seems to work well	1
worked fine	1
the camera on this phone is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the eax features are very useful as well as creative has developed a number of noise reduction adjustments that for example can compensate for the extraneous noise that can occur in a car or on a train	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter so i was not able to find a mac version of the driver that is compatible	0
i was a little surprised to see it in the low end	0
the player has the ability to choose which will fix the glitches if there are any	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think that this system offers some advantages	1
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
takes place	1
awesome sound quality	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice bonus when i need to back up from my various computers	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features such as a currency converter and a stopwatch	1
they have a pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio experience	1
loved the slim design	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and having all the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce a lot of interesting photos contrary to what i had previously experienced	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
cards for example are an important feature but not on this player	0
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free to download you can draw from any picture on your computer and if you want to you can even create your own apps games	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds good even with the volume down i dont know if it should be all the way down but it is all right because these are the best	0
works out	1
i ve also had the nomad zen name	0
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
despite this slight disappointment i highly recommend the book to anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
it was very easy	1
it is easy to use and yet complex	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy battery life which is a lot worse than other cheaper apex units	0
works great	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been in love with it since receiving it and i bought a second one as a christmas present for myself	1
trumps support from congress is literally nonexistent	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
kudos to you even though your products are of superb quality your support is invaluable	1
my computer is working just fine	1
mp is about right for the size and weight of this camera	1
i love it and when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
the speakers are fabulous and their is a lot of music to it there are tons of features i have not even gotten to	1
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
it is closest to being better than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
a week out of the box and i am starting to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more and more intense	1
the color screen makes this free after market phone shine bright and the buttons are very responsive	1
other things that i miss are voice activated buttons a headphone jack and a standard mm headset jack	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i think i like it	1
i have had no problem with what so ever with this product	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of the food	0
the time from in the box to it working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
the hot shoe flash unit which has allowed me to buy and use a new flash unit	1
the nikon coolpix is one of the best cameras to use high quality and compact in size	1
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
this thing is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that you can watch if you want he said its amazing	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
i like this player	1
it is not plug and play as you have to install the music player first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and downloading the music and then playing the music	0
the better you do nt have to worry about constantly charging your batteries	1
it was very cool and it looked quite small to me and very light	1
the system through windows explorer windows recognizes the nomad as an additional hard disk so it allows you to easily drag and drop files from the main drive to a folder for the nomads to access	1
i set it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player so far i have only used this player for about hours at a time	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
i can t understand why the software does not show the when it lists the items in alphabetical order	0
the player will freeze up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
these are viewable on my screen but seem not as big as when i see them on my monitor	0
took me a few days to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player and very easy to use	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of the screen make the type of display either list or tabbed	1
this is amazing	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am finding it to be better than any i have used before	1
i think youll love this feature	1
seemed like a good deal but this computer frequently can not recognize dvds and music files takes a long time to load and then crashes	0
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can change existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
what got me the most was the fact that it said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
also it was very easy to set up a route as long as the route was exactly the same as my route on netgear	1
the last year has been a steady performer for me	1
this machine is a great tool for your desktop	1
other then that it is a fantastic piece of kit for the price	1
best in the sound	1
to my amazement even that process was possible	1
however if the signal strength and power to transmit a signal across the house are not sufficient then this router will do the job	1
its easy to go online and check itll	1
some movies it wo nt play todaysome moviesit ont play today	0
i wished that they could change the volumn a little bit more	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when i need to back things up from my various computers	1
this is the best dvd player i have	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no real explanation of this and with it just a crude and incomplete instruction of how to do it which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
my life is ok	1
i get good coverage everywhere in my house i have about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my house	1
easy to read	1
i thought it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a video it just wasnt up to the task	0
good looks	1
great sound quality good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers good	1
protective case is useless as is since it obscures display window	0
no fm or voice recording these words	0
very good value for the money	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t to t mobile i am delighted to be reunited with them and look forward to august when i will be able to transfer my data from at tto t mobile	0
the source code was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha or beta at best	1
there was occasionally a new issue	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g was dead	0
now there is one other thing i have about the g and that is the memory that comes with it for processing raw images i only use it in raw image mode and the first thing i did was to start with a mbyte cf which	0
the cheap user interface and the battery is a great advantage over the ipod is the best	1
i have been working on it for years and now it shows a mixture of text and de focused text	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
then sorting the files is easy as well	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
i am happy and have no complaints over this unit	1
while it was very impressive i was put off by the price which was about more than what i paid amazon for	1
i think i like it	1
it has all the features one would expect	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
it plays basically any dvd that i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that can nt be played on my old dvd player	1
main dial is not backlit	0
one downside though is that it does not work well when the ambient temperature is low	0
i have been able to easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even a little bit of distortion as yet	1
the software which comes with the app is not good at all	0
well after a few days the video output quit working	0
you ll be unable to track down the cd because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
i purchased a jukebox it had a battery and while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and told me that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
seriously i love it	1
we started reading and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for some reason	0
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean i hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and it works fine	1
item shipped out quickly was in great condition and came with easy to use set up disk we have not had to re set the router at all since it is installed so my wife is no longer giving me the business about having her wireless internet	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell to it	0
does what it should and the rest of it sounds fine to me	1
also you can store music on your ipod which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to listen to music if you have an ipods do nt think this is a good buy or better	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
take a look at the s pii	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
this thing is awesome	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player you cant go wrong	0
the stock is a good buy for the price	1
our special friends at creative studio have given this thing good sound quality great features for the price long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera i have ever used	1
i ve been trying to get by with the highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
i was dissapointed that the e mail address was nt more helpful	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the only reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to read so you can t get an accurate reading of the dial	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
my friends were very impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
cheap construction they should have made the walls out of hard plastic and put a metal frame on the corners	0
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is very easy to do and the quality is very good	1
the sound quality is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
over all a great experience with a very compact camera which made us take our photography on a totally new level	1
how this product was created and was left behind	0
the problem is that the fact that anything has connected to it has been around for so long that it s even when in the same room	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little device	1
i d venture to say that because of it i think it is the best set out there costwise	1
all i can say is that this is awesome	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is not a bad player it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the storage capacity is great	1
great color scheme for the picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the door closed	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
a great deal for a relatively low price	1
key instead	0
when i opened it up i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via email or either text or email simply were nt there	0
finally making a cd from the computer can be a bit of a pain because the tracks are listed individually and are separated by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
anyways back to the point i have tried to be so calm over the past couple of years with acer and their terrible service and i have failed	0
some movies it didnt play yesterday it wo nt play today	0
it has been	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
i did nt think much of it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just kind of fizzled out	0
the phone is very easy to use it is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
the interface used could be better	0
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
i have it and there is no limit as to what i can do with it	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the controls are a little more difficult to use than the other models but i have gotten use to them and they work well which i did not think would justify the huge difference in price	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was bad but this one is amazing	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the results	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given the quality	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
you can do so much more with the pc suite i can make free ringtones from midi files you can make graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps for	1
i think there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
but this camera is	1
it is not	0
the hair is so soft you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to a couple of different tvs i have a lot of tvs in my house and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
simply this product was created and sold	0
the first one we installed did not work and we had to replace it we were devastated to say the least	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
the zen stores data in memory but does not store files nor does it allow files to be opened or programs to be launched from it	0
i love this guy	1
the tiny remote control is wonderful because not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review photos	1
most products will come with a warranty and logitech is no exception they are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact more expensive than my old radio	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is out there	1
creative zen also suffers from construction issues poor product support and a lack of using the scroll wheel and the lack of consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
i had no problems setting up the software and now my favorite cd is back	1
the game itself is pretty solid	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
does not recognize the player at all times despite being connected and the player is library	0
we really teamed up well on this baby	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
the button is finicky it is not hard to press but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have a very low satisfaction rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
you can move the camera to almost any point in the scene with the press of a button and it has an on screen manual control mode that would be really helpful if you are in a scene that is very complex	1
i am really impressed by this	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
this little speaker is awesome	1
got a new phone with problem days after purchase	0
i am nt going to go into detail here as the online sites go into more detail in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the camera has the picture quality the flexibility the battery life and the functional conveniences it	1
when the camera was nt contracting or in use the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
i ve been doing the same thing by clicking on the s and the s seems to do only slightly better	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
to be fair even that process was error prone	0
the sound quality is not good either and the driver has trouble keeping up with other sound blaster products which is annoying	0
the price performance looked just fine	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for you	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery to power it as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like the typical samsung galaxy phones	1
i think i m giving this one a pass as i ve seen nothing of the problems that others have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i m only had it for a few days i have room for doubt if the headphone jack or scroll wheel	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen better than the nx is able to	1
lrb i feel like you cant use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i felt like you could use a dsl and got a linksys dsl mod instead	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
i have this connected to my pc and it works flawlessly	1
i really like the fact that it is a tablet it is so much more portable than a regular laptop	1
creating playlists with the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
keep your fingers on the keys	1
i was looking forward to this movie even if all the other reviews have said it was slow	0
fragile	0
bottom line is that it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re not sure why we bought this router for our two computers	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor audio quality difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent audio quality complaints about problems with the headphone jack	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear to the police	0
progressive scan player for a fraction of the price	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my new nvidia glassesmonitor is easy to setup with my nvidia glasses	0
the light is small light and very attractive	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the phone constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of problem in the base we can no longer use the phone the phone has to be connected with the base or it turns off	0
meanwhile the instructions for installing the app indicated i should load a pdf of instructions but it turns out it only shows a link to a pdf and nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
it makes up for this by being very easy to use with a very well laid out interface that can be learned quickly	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one device	1
it had a larger and more sturdy casing	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
battery life is good because i use it every day and i have to charge it every night	1
i love the storage system	1
would definatley be a great addition to your home and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
sure it had a girl in it but when i tried to make a girl is a game it just wasnt up to the task	0
i am very happy with this product i love the quality and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
easy to read	1
my only complaint is that the list is not long enough	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and streaming services are the main reasons	1
it is simply the firmware and or the os that control this system that is not ready for prime time	0
volume level is ok	1
i am using jbl n ii as the speaker on the right which is again a very excellent speaker set	1
i really have no complaints at all	0
the connection is not reliable and has been dropped	0
sound exceptional though i can t wait to get it to the ipod	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do not mind buying it	0
the problem is large	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
the brightness is really good	1
this product is not available at any price	1
the possibilities with auto settings and the very helpful scene editor which offers optimized situational settings for the camera lighting etc are endless	1
pros competitive cost of home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my phone and its free	0
they claim to have fixed it in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a fix	0
the usb port on the back is a very nice feature	1
so far the router has worked well	1
i also really liked the fact that you can play the game that you made on the player not just the computer	1
i highly recommend a look	1
the sound that came from that tiny little record player made me feel like carnegie hall	1
wire runs through the body of the car giving it a very clean look	1
i have good hearing but the volume level on this phone is too loud	0
i love this guy	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
the lessons of history are razor sharp even in macro	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my old pc to get it working again twice not fun	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
i m not always impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like a volume control with the options	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the only person who has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as myself season season and season	0
and it has sooooo much music and audio files	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
my blu ray player is broken and i normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a blu ray firmware upgrade and perform my duties forever thereafter	0
all in all this is an excellent creative product	1
the only problem with this box is that it is broken several times an hour if not more frequently	0
it is crystal clear	1
the past year has nt been easy for me at all	1
when you put this thing in your pocket you dont even know it is there it is so small and oh so light	1
i was looking for portability and a good price and this one delivers both	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the companys telephone number is always busy and they do not answer our calls	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking a picture it would be much easier	0
the lcd is brighter than the lcd in the original and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more brightly than the lcd which is green backlight did	1
only con i foto there is no camera	0
the sound is so good that my son is so excited he wants one now	1
the power button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
its for the money	0
vocals have been added for clarity with the ihome as well	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
chic look and simple design to build the player into a portable device in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
i just purchased this phone and i have to say this is the coolest phone i have ever had	1
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
i would have liked the option of having an external adjustable antenna but it does work as is and the speed on the other side of the house is much improved	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to me so i never know how far i d go to try this	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
this unit was working fine for the first hour and a half and then the color signal went out	0
the internet connection is out of the phone wap and it will only work through t mobile which is a problem because they have removed the menu options that would allow you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
despite its being slightly larger than i must admit i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1

to be honest i think this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
it is versatile and is considered to be one of the best	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers the best solution	1

the camera is very easy to use in the field and on a recent trip i took this past week i was asked to take a picture of a local elderly group	1
i found using this app to add your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using the app itself	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
i m giving this player cautious praise	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
but with a low price comes a high risk	0
the on radio button on the front of the router didnt work because the gui one wasnt working so anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the button	0

the money which comes with player is not worth it at all	0
navigation can be a little tricky at first but there is nt really much the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0

changes in the user interface	0

the g looks like a work of art	1
both units are equipped with similarly small speakers	1
i find this interesting	1
i think the best thing about the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	0
the image quality is poor	0
apparently t mobile phones are expensive and can t keep up with demand	0
it would just spin up and stop and start again	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
well i hope this does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i m easily enlarging the picture to fit with my laptop but not in picture quality and not even at the best possible setting as yet	0
i have been disappointed to see that there is no printed instructions with it just a link to the website with an instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
it sounds great in the shower or on my night stand	1
over for the price this is a good deal	1

setup was very simple	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
easy to read	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the buttons are on the side of the thing instead of on the top which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain songs with no problems on blu ray but not on the dvd	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0

i did this on the notmad site for a week or so and found that a vast improvement	1
it also has extensive coverage through our two story series	1
fragile	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no confusion	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0

simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there and the best camera at this price point	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
the on off button is somewhat flimsy and has an extremely tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the light	0

pc usb cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
however it is not real intuitive	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below average	0
the buttons and buttons on the keyboard are very easy to use	1
while going for a test drive i was very determined to buy a samsung galaxy s only as it is the best in cellphones	1
the device does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to fix it the device is unrepairable	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is very good once you have it set up and configured	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online shopping services and pc compatibility are the other benefits	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
plusses are the ability to remove your clothes and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
it is so small but it has value mac	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat screen tv with such horrible viewing angles	0
wyja nienie fantastic esp w iphone docked	0
i was pretty sure this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera i have under	1
at the very least a nice sturdy and light carrying case would be nice	1
the other player is fine	1
this was the last video before the video output no longer worked	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for free in the box is mind blowing	1
it does make you look pretty spending this kind of cash you know on something that has the chance to go a bit down of course	1
acer has been a nightmare to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a very poor repair facility to match it	0

my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no way for me to get rid of this product	1
i recommend the powershot g to anyone looking for a great camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera in this period	1
i think they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners of the helmet	0

in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
the battery life is amazing	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
i am ncercat	0
they do look cool in the dark though	0
overall an excellent phone	1
the reason i say that is because of the fact that its very small and hard to find so you can t get it	0
i am sure this unit will have problems in the future and the no charge no questions asked replacement warranty will be of no use since it will only warrant it for days which in itself is a problem	0
it is very solidly built and has a very solid and dense feel to it	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users say i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only works on mac computers and offered nothing by way of explanation on how to do it for apple computers	0
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
at least i dealt with this as mbps was still a problem	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
it has very good range much better than the car it replaced	1
the software is	1
it does have a lense cap but it is nt very noticeable unless you take a photo with it on which is not good	0

the price was the lowest i d ever seen in my research lrb best buy in the depot	1
sharp enough	1
we ve tried a few universal dvd players so far all claiming to work as dvd cameras and none worked	0

due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just started using it a few months ago i was very unimpressed	0
does not provide enough volume when compared to larger headphones or external receivers	0
first i ll start you off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i spent hours on the phone but with lrb you can get connected right away and do nt have to wait and i am at least getting my imac and macbook back online	1
for the price of this product i could not ask for more	1
i love this player and am very happy with my decision	1
i am amazed and amazed at the quality of the raw images i get and can only hope that i can keep up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its own limits	1
excellent battery life hours of play time ipod is	1
i treat the battery well and it lasts a long time	1
the first one has worked good for years	1
and it works great too	1

i ve now had it for two months and i ve never been even more pleased with it	1
the ability to shuffle modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is not available on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
it does nt look too bad but after spending this kind of cash you would expect something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
pictures can be transferred from nt pc to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
the company has also released a patch which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
small print	1
your house is nice and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1

picture quality in outdoor mode is indistinguishable from indoor mode	1
no headphone jackno headset jack	0
i try navigating to where the player is built in the game and it still would nt work	0

a sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
halfway through the first upgrade progress bar the infamous not found screen pops up and most of the time there is interface	0
p s it does seem to get confused at times and its a bit annoying but it may be just operator error	0
i just got home from work and everything seemed to be going fine	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0

nice and easy to use and excellent when it comes to downloading music from www crazycellphone com	1
we own two of these and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact cars i am also very happy at the low price these cars are selling for here on amazon	1

i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
nice machines but i consider them to be pretty low now	0
i have been using this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
so now it all plays out and you just can t see it	0

what really made this a great mp player for me was the software	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious users will appreciate so it is a good tool to grow into	1

all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
the headphone jack seems to be gone	0
it is crystal clear	1
this router was well worth the money it shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up instructions we have nt had to re set the router at all so far and it is delivery so my wife is no	1

i have tried a few times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to be available and i am sure he is constantly busy as the one lonely rep is probably extremely overworked	0
i would get a hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again then the system would crash	0
the zennx will be up and running for the price you pay just like any other battery powered appliance	1
the set up is goof proof and the result is a superior result	1

the sound from the player is not audible	0
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
the fm radio is a radio station	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
it is always a good idea to pop it open to see what music you re listening to	1
very easy to use	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like some of the other android phones	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
i found it very useful for me to transfer my files to another computer	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a computer can do	1

i am really impressed by this dvd player	1

it has a lot of features much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
unfortunately it can t be found on all of the dvd	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
all in all this is a very good deal for anyone who has a small desktop computer and wants a lapdesk and a keyboard	1
we got to the end of the nemo chapter and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
both are very easy to learn use and will be easy enough for even a novice	1

the truth is that the fastest speed that has ever been measured has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for its routers that it does not even know what to do	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find these displays to be excellent	1

my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
the bass is very deep and the bass is really deep as well	1
i e i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital art	1
the only problem is the speaker wire is very thin	0
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably one of the best out there	1
the battery life is very good it takes very lttle time to charge it up and there is no delay between songs	1
it was great	1
the results are amazing	1
despite most people giving a thumbs up to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using it	0
halfway through the router upgrade progress bar the infamous router is not found it has been replaced most of the router is interface	0
great minds	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your vision	0

i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1

the player is mechanics are good but flawed	0
the x digital zoom is a nice addition and the x digital zoom was a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a bit blurry	1

the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
on the other hand indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as outdoor shots	0
naturally i did quite a bit of research before buying this and price wise zens are unbeatable	1

great picture	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
i should ve trusted my instincts about the terrible repair team of acer	0
in short if you re someone that is a little bit afraid of technology and you just want to be able to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and not have to worry about it all day this router is great for you	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
unfortunately after all these songs all i get now is player error	0

it would either not play the song at all or skip to the next song no matter that the unit was resting on it	0

the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that may arise	1
there was occasionally a	1

the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
for the price and size and the fact that you can t get it for the price	1

when we tried to make changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1

i like the system features and performance	1
we are well pleased with the results	1

tech support in india is literally nonexistent	0

when it comes to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
the picturers are	1
the only other minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
i think the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
the service from t mobile phone	0
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1

the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just a bit slow and does nt load on some computers	0
image camera	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the screen is big enough for people to see whats going on	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
easy to use with simple installation instructions found in the install drive	1
this router is awesom but it will only support one type of computer and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are not the best when i called them they were very nice and tried their best to	0
then sorting the files is easy as well	1
depressing the scroll button to continue	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that when i try to i d the year data from the cdds service the whole process fails to populate the year field	0
this camera is worth every penny and i would highly recommend it	1
i was looking for both and this product delivers both	1
the screen is bright and easy to read and the silver color of the screen is naturally cool	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this model that it does not even know what to do	0

they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0

the price is very good	1
billy joel was right on the money when he said you get more mileage from a good pair of speakers	1
it is perfect if you are traveling all over the world it is a great device with wonderful features	1

the machine is very light and slim and fits very nicely into my tv stand	1
you can not get any mid range or bass response at lower levels without some help from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak it	0

this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
although the phone is a little light on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily designed to do to be able to do	1
color and contrast are perfect for this	1

when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the clouds were nt moving i thought they were awesome	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single screen	1
the process is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
having this file will cause the music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0

the zen xtra sounds great with a good mix and well recored mp s	1

but i think it is perfect	1
there are a lot of options as to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in audio crossovers	0
after using it for just a month i cant believe it	0

i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
its fine	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1

they were both good	1
canon text	0
this phone has many other features but just to name one the features above i view as the best	1

it is the most bang for the buck investment out there	1

i do nt know what other people think of this but the idea is awesome	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were too young to understand the difference	0
i think the lens cap design is flawed	0
now my eyes are much more distinct and i do not have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb i dont know what i had to do with that thanks	1

while i would like to give it stars instead of i do because it has been one of the best books for me during the time i have owned it	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
good battery life	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the windows jukebox to be a lot easier and faster than using windows explorer	1

the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0

the problem is that it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is hard to tell when it does because it does it so often	0
a little bit sore but otherwise fine	0
you can adjust it to be just about anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a difference	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0

it worked great and we just plugged it in	1
this item was the most expensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1

no propietary headset jack	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
it takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0

file picture	1
the music is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
i m not very happy with it	0
the next day i tried it on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector was removed	0
best electronic i ve played since i was born	1
of course i was sceptical given the price but i ve been extremely impressed with the quality of it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
the problem is mechanics are also flawed	0
this product is not available at any price	1
great minds	1
the final insult is that while the app comes with useful software to allow sharing files wirelessly and it is only a free version you have to pay for the trial and download it from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to	1
this product is too strong for normal use	1
the custom eq did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
i ve tried to connect this unit to my computer using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
solid resistant to scratches and scratches excellent heat dissipation	1
the picture is clear bright and clear and the quality is good	1
third trial continues with the case	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
some people have problems with the switch on the bottom that releases the switch but this has not been an issue for me and is not a problem if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
but for what i do for a living it is perfect	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
it is a fun little gadget do not expect high definition sound	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level all the time will come in handy when i need it	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find the nikon to be a great product that i can recommend	1
although i agree with most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw with the eax	0
the colors and everything are beautiful	1
the best i have ever experienced	1
and then i had to figure out how to put my chinese songs in the title because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
so besides the fact that this is a great speaker for the amount i paid	1
for my money this dvd player was everything i expected it to be an affordable compact format dvd recorder with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
the inside pics are great but when you can instantly see things you do nt like that are not in focus or need lighting adjustments it makes this camera very simple and easy to use	0
what the hell is going on with this thing	0
x zoom is nice	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
the best features are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
overall a good buy for the price	1
the pc side of the game can be goofy and take a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my phone up to the standard vga port a few days ago and the picture is fine	1
lots of flaws but the sound quality is good and the size and price make it a good buy	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums from my itunes library	1
minor problems even though the music is sorted according to the id tag on the player the option to search for the music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek look to it and works fine	1

the zennx will be up and running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
it seems that it only seems to work if you re away from the player for a while but that could have been just the batteries that came with it	0
if you are looking for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
while the differences are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the number of mp s with each zoom setting and you must go through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
if you are not worried about image quality go for it	0

i think the lens cap design is flawed	0
i am so proud of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone	1

these have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the volume up	1
the battery life is amazing	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0

however in the end i think this book is an excellent choice	1
naturally i did some research before purchasing and i found that wise zens are unbeatable	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also has a lot of flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual mode	1
it has all the features that you would need in a cellphone	1
sound pretty good though i can t really compare it to the others	1
it has never worked	0
i bought this one because i thought it was the best deal for the money	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes a long time	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it so much more fun to use i love this phone	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was just a shame i had to learn at all	1
it looks great and is very easy to use with features	1
this product is definitely worth a try	1
the tripod is a great tool that works well for a lot of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i have had it for a while now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
it was easy to unbox and install	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
convenience because it can be used through the usb port	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just fell out of it	0
usb means usb	1
also included is a free book but that is not a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
and if you do well there is no complaints about that	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered to be the best image quality of any current megapixel camera especially from a low light contrast white balance and color response point of view	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
great sound good sound quality replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers good	1
it is small and lightweight so it easily fits in my pocket	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i but i am thrilled with my purchase	1
i used this monitor for years and now it works great with a mixture of various monitors and de focused text	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
software development	1
i have not had time to really push this player to the limit but i think the results on the field are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
ipod vs gb ipod for the price	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
the players are top notch	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
the keypad is easy to use but the power on off button is small and difficult to press	0
it does not only have the ability to play jpegs it even has the capability of properly playing dvd movies	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone to be disturbing	0
the scroll wheel is a big improvement	1
the remote works but then it stops working and you are left in the dark thinking you are doing something wrong	0
about of the problem is that it can t connect to the device when i connect it to my pc	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent too	1
this was very prompt and a great shipping service	1
well flash photos are great and there was still a lot of light	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three rooms in my house lrb unit is very easy to use and easy in the setup and security aspects	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the fact that it fits nicely into any pocket or bag	1
it was a snap to set up and my new asus eee netbook is now running my games and pcs all day without issue	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
despite this minor issue i highly recommend the book to anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
the only bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is useless	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the rest of the department	1
this guy is amazing	1
the link does not work properly	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get the hang of it	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the software i am using is very easy to install and set up	1
well on keypad	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
beautiful home theater and home theater speaker crisp highs and lows and respectable bass	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear them anymore	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player in my opinion was the software	0
i love this player and am very happy with my decision	1
the sound quality is really good	1
we ve had universal remotes so far all claiming to work with dvd players and none of them worked	0
so far i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr that i have downloaded from cds	1
user name battery	1
the scene still works well for the remainder of the movie even with characters that are not meant to be in a regular setting	1
the auto focus performs well but i would recommend having the optional scene modes they are very useful and correspond to the situations in which i would most likely seek to use the camera	1
this camera was built in and produces spectacular images	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
it sounds good to have out on the patio or on my night stand	1
unfortunately the player did not read any of my region one dvds so i have no idea how they were not damaged in any way	0
all in all a great device bad customer service run like hell from this company	0
bought the new xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
also the case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are on the side i have to open it up to see the display	1
the player itself has all sorts of options	1
i think i like the unit	1
software is the great misfortune of my life crashes frequently screwed my music library up does not work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
definitely more capable of filling the room with music than any other i ve owned	1
hooked up to the internet and tried to link extreme speeds connected speed dropped to mbps and then down to mps	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the bass with a sweet little sub	1
this was very prompt standard shipping and handling	1
the software has never been a hassle for me at all	1
here is a picture of the box it is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
crazycellphone is cheap and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from the internet free and easy to use crazycellphone com	1
no matter the format	1
it took me a few days to get use to the game but it is a very fast and friendly player imo	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
fm says it has none	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this time this camera has so many features i have never seen before and i havent gotten to all of them yet	1
update the finish is a bit different and i like it	1
i think the real reason that made the change is that it now makes sense to use gpu hardware acceleration	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at the end of the month which is now available and it resolved all my problems	1
i am very pleased with my zx so here is a link to my review	1
i could tell this was a good monitor as soon as i set it up	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
then he would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
the post was not sent as long as you have an adminstrative user account	0
however you do get what you pay for in the end	1
the progressive scan feature can be turned on and off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the most intuitive remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very easy	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i did nt get any wierd sounds from it like i did with the other one	1
this camera can be set on auto or in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
a few of my work constituants in the canon and highly recommend to the canon for picture quality	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
both the bose quietcomfort and the bowers wilkins speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
navigation is easy and i liked the fact that transferring files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
the screen is large and easy to read	1
the sound from the car is ok	1
this router is	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the app is sub par	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
it has very good range much better than the old router it replaced	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
the camera is so powerful that not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to take photos reuters	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the software i am using can not work on my pc	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
despite the things that i have listed above i can live with this cd case as it saves me from having to carry a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
it is a bit bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not the same technology that is used in the zx	1
the music is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times especially when there are a lot of talkers on the other end of the line	1
the woofer is large	1
i found the apex ad to be a great buy	1
i was a little disappointed in the way it came to an end	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus i was able to get it working in less than minutes	1
price and location were the two main factors that i picked the nomad	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
yes there is a bit of distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and uses it as a tool to minimize the distortion and that is what you see ot the picture	0
finally i reiterate my decision to shut down my account for t mobile as a carrier	0
the power this slim design puts out	1
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
the features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range we highly recommend the canon eos d mark ii and its variants	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the usb drive i had attached to the usb drive was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
very good value for the money	1
the car will keep running for the rest of its life just like any other battery powered appliance	1
having someone to talk to where ever you go is terrific	1
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
the possibilities with the manual and the new scene mode which offers optimized situational settings such as portrait landscape beach or sunset etc are endless	1
but he never fails to amaze	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
does not provide the best sound quality when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
i will definitely not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
it was worth the wait because it is a great movie that has all this and more	1
its fine	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
overall i was able to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features to choose from highly recommended	1
the canon file for the raw image does not provide you with a raw image at all but the raw images after it has been processed by all the image affecting elements in the image	0
bottom line is for the price you pay they sound great and have tons of good bass	1
for the price and features it offers	1
due to the lack of support for whs is a guestnetwork and having just bought the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
i found using the mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using the explorer	1
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
both of the problem dvd is that it repeatedly stopped playing during playback while the playback on the player kept going	0
its out of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
would nt buy again because of this	0
and so far have not had any problems with any of them	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
in a world where others say not bright enough	0
i have to say i m actually pretty impressed by the quality of the sound quality especially for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
you can open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream to your computer just click on the player to listen download from the xtra	1
no more pixels on mine	1
i love it and would probably do it with creative labs again	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i agree with the person who said that there is a need for a vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	1
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
it has a resolution of p which is average for these cameras	0
her work is phenomenal	1
i think the router has worked well	1
and if you do well there is no complaints about that	1
the daylight pictures are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
i ve been using the belkin fm radio unit with it it worked well when i was using it on my phone but was not as good when trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
in the hands of a person who does nt it will not give you good results on idiot program auto mode	1
the battery life is amazing	1
the support was very helpful and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
i am enjoying my phone so much	1
the music playback mode that allows you to keep the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
transfer through windows explorer is also available as a drag and drop tool so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the same reason	1
it is very light weight and has very good performance	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
either way you can t go wrong with this price	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the next time you wear these ones out	0
and with the new app transferring data to your player is incredibly easy	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to see what the heck i had to do with it	1
great value gb vs ipod great value ipod for the price	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i was very surprised to find that not only could this program be used to play movies which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
and as long as amazon has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
i would recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	0
also the feature to automatically change the lyrics in the song information is nt very accurate	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the camera is very user friendly and it is very easy to clean the camera in it chrome casing	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up things on my countertop and then to listen to music	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
because this girl is beautiful	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
i got it today it works great great i have to say that the volume for iphone and the towers own remote are two different things that should be controlled at the right measures to work properly so i do not complain for the fact	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the reason i don t recommend it a lot is because of that darn diopter adjustment knob its very small and hard to see so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
in all i d say this is a very good router	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this computer as well as a few gigs of other music stored in other computers	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
i got this for christmas and it was awesome	1
i was really surprised at how good the sound quality was and i especially like being able to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on a house i paid over dollars for	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the door would not close	0
i t	0
made call which was immediately answered by the police	0
it takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
the router has obviously problems with this program and numerous other programs	0
uploading the images to my windows pc is very fast and easy	1
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
very bad quality	0
audio files can not be created for the audio files	0
getting access to the device is so easy	1
downloading music files is based on id and this can be a problem for those who have downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id tags https www youtube com watch feature player embedded v	0
it will only move the monitor side to the lrb no up down or side to side feature	0
great phone i d dhe another	1
on average the results with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
protective case cant be used as is since it obscures display window	0
you can see all of them in the view finder	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing it is very good for a computer speaker rrb this is a good choice	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the health and longevity of the people who work on the thing	0
as a whole the cd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
there is an alarm i still have nt sure if it works but it should be working soon	0
what a day	1
the door closed	1
the battery life seems to be good it takes very lttle time to charge it up and there is no delay between songs	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear and with sprint	1
excellent service and i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily keep up with the cameras limitations because i ve never been able to do anything else with it within its resolution limits	1
i am quite happy with the camera	1
the color screen is very good and this free after rebates phone is very fast and commands are very responsive	1
in the hands of a person who does it right it will yield good results on idiot proof auto mode	1
it has a x and y zoom which is average for a smartphone	0
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the woofer is much larger	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
i found the controls very intuitive and i learned how to manuver through the menus very quickly	1
the things that are really cool like the radio	1
i remain extremely pleased with	1
as it stands now this feature is pretty useless unless you are packing the player up for a long flight or if you load up all your gear beforehand	0
you can create playlists and drop songs and playlists to your mp player and you can play songs directly from cd to your player	1
after several years of being in the hands of at t customer service i am very happy with the results and i look forward to the day when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is when she was in the car it worked as expected even out of doors	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts for a year on one single charge the software is great and it is easy to get in it chrome is great	1
price gb of storage	1

price	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a good coffee machine should be	1
the controls are much inferior to these	0

my other big complaint about it is the stand	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1

its size which might not seem to matter except if you are going to use it while driving or keep it in your pocket	0

the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while to do a reset	0
this is fantastic and it is really nice to carry this around instead of wondering what kind of cd is or isnt it	1
small print	1
it would have been a lot nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the screen did not cover up the screen	0
the eax features are pretty cool as well as the fact that it has included some of the features that for example compensate for the ambient noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
it read read read spin some more and then i saw on the display that there was no disc	0
now that i m here however i can t imagine being anywhere else	1
i ve tried the radio transmitter and after a few minutes with it it worked well when i set it on the radio but was useless when trying to get in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
without a doubt the best looking apex dvd player that i ve ever seen	1
pros huge storage capacity for music can be difficult to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the great features that a great game has and if you get if from us your only going to pay for this great player	1

the sound this slim design brings out	1
i can see for hours day in and day out with dark colors the colors and brightness change on the panel when i look from the center to the corner	1

the sound quality are nt the best but you can really expect a lot out of the small headphones you get	1
apple is bigger than the ipod	0
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and use	1
we are the sound people for eax and i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
but if you have used a slr mm camera the controls are much easier	0
its small size which might not seem to be a problem except if you use it while running or if you keep it in your pocket	0
i am very happy with the jbl n ii as well which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
not a bad deal to pay for but it is nothing special	1

its all about the magnesium alloy construction which is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than anything i ve seen	1

the sound quality has been poor since we bought the phone the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some kind of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the phone or it turns off completely	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
i think the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
it seems that with each new firmware release the router gets better better	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the songs are listed individually and are organized by genre but there are songs which are not listed but are included in the playlist	0
last night i forgot to reset the router	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is very user friendly and idiot proof	1
overall i like the unit	1

much faster than my previous acer one netbook with the same battery	1

however a phone call to the customer service line was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process of contacting the company	1
i get to chapter and it freezes	0
also it was only with free shipping and no returns so overall it is a good deal	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
i am happy and have no complaints over this unit	1
however some of the more bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to disconnect both it and my computer from the internet in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
it is extremely light and easy to carry in your pocket	1

customer service and technical support are overloaded and they will tell you about the quality of their products and their willingness to help you	0
customer service and technical support are what tells you about the quality of their product and their willingness to stand up for you	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
your message was answered	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement of the monitor so that from a heighth perspective rrb that you are looking at will not fit in	0
i put the cds in alphabetical order but i can t figure out why the software does not ignore the when it comes to the alphabet	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1

my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0

i ve been using it for about six months now and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
the speakers have a very rich soundstage and low bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you are looking for	1

it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1

it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
this dvd play button	1
this item was the most inexpensive lcd monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
the quality of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this is a case where the company is just scrambling to put out fires	0

they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually sound pretty good	1
third the poor design continues with the following	0

the windows premium is good but i do nt recommend starter rrb and it is not user friendly	0

the woofer	0
this article has been updated to find out more just log on to canon is website	0
connection to the device is possible	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for its performance i experienced a flaw using eax	0
however once you turn up the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done at work the sound quality is great as well this is a great product for a computer speaker system	1
all i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	1
but if you want a great deal and a great experience you can always get the nomad	1

it has never worked	0
i simply love this feature	1

there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s screen with a lot of color bleeding in and out due to a component connection	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take great pictures with the macro mode you can unbelievably close the subject	1
the only problem is that it reboots several times an hour if not more often	0

yes the features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1

like it is predecessor the recently revised nx this player boasts a good balance between size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes songs based on id tags and excellent sound	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a high quality signal across the network are your requirements then this system will do the job	1
the image quality is excellent	1
and then i had to figure out how to put my chinese songs on youtube because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
navigation system the zen music system the mp id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0

usb network storage is good but it is slow	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it control the shutter it can also be used to zoom and pan around the room	1
the speakers perform very well and with the addition of the subwoofer the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer	0
p s the remote control does not seem to be working properly at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
i spent hours on the net with their help and support lrb you can and do nt have to and got at least my imac and macbook for free online	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0

nothing but hassle with this company	0
my overall experience with this monitor was very positive	1

the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
but if you are looking for a great deal and a great team player get the nomad	1
it has been a great year my favorite being the games and the movies and the radio	1
i called the company and they gave me support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
although i must say i was surprised to see just how big it was when i unwrapped the box despite its being slightly larger than the box i was expecting it to be	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the only minor complaints i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a strap and it is a bit slow at taking pictures	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
the first night i got this phone i put it in my pocket and when i went to bed i used it just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and i feel so com	0
and i think this is the best phone one can have	1
i was willing to live with the small size but the durability was lacking	0
the quality is very good	1
the buttons on the side are small and a bit too big for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
its kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
i have tried several times to contact apex through their website their support line and their telephone line but they wo not answer my emails and their phone line is always busy	0
granted i have only used this dvd player once before for a few minutes while setting it up for my son for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with thisdvd player	0

if you use the gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and hit that dreaded apply button yes or no enjoy	0
and for the price this is the best phone one could have	1
the good thing is that the backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is bright enough for people to see	1
the cover that came with it did not seem to fit very well	0
if you can afford it it is woth every penny	1
the replacement was even worse than the old one which was now working fine	1
usb network is great but supposedly it is slow	0
the day finally arrived when i knew i d leave sprint	1
hooked it up and it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
but then again it can be so loud that i heard it from the other side of my office when i was working out on the street	1
second is that in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned to us for repair or replacement	0
portable	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
even better you do not have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
excellent battery life and quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
my other gripe is the incredibly high price of the remote which is higher than other cheaper apex units	1
it comes as a free app with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the sound is excellent as one would suspect it would be	1
after nearly a year i have found that my camera takes incredible pictures	1
it would spin read spin some more and then it would come to the conclusion that there was no disc	0

creative mediasource software is ok to use to rip and burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my music before i uploaded it to youtube and guess what	0
overall a very good buy for the price	1
the problem with this game is that it reboots at least as often if not more frequently	0
i had no problem using the software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this computer	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have a place for them as they grow	1
i think the lens cap design is flawed	0
best thing i ve bought since i was born	1
and so far there is no complaints about that	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an external case you can not use the ipod without first removing the case	1
note that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
with mediasource being so easy i have no use for the bundled media explorer software	0
the touchpad is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is nothing to do with it just a crude pictorial instruction manual which has a great deal of information missing	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the fact that it zooms gets you closer to the subject	1
the link does not work properly	0
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
the lcd screen is	1
the speakers have a very good soundstage with good treble and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
you can do so much more with the jme app you can download free ringtones from the internet you can draw graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own	1
cocaine is too fragile for normal use	0
best in class performance	1
this is my first iphone and it worked right out of the box	1
bottom line well made camera with easy to use controls and very flexible and powerful features to suit the needs of the usereasy to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the fact that the screen is really big and the blue button in the back is not as fast as it should be in music players but the controls are pretty good after mastering the scroll button	1
i started accessing and transfering files to my computer and uploaded it to github	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access the internet very well at all	0

it has good reviews and reviews and price was great	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
i went in and tried to help but just went through a script and was unsuccessful sic	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
it also has a stock tracking app which you can invest in and a somewhat useful application which converts your money	0
good for speed	1
i m not happy with this product	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through monitors now and its still not working	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
it does not need to be refrigerated and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
the monitor works very well with a wide viewing angle and bright display	1
my only gripe about the hardware is that	0
feel like it is feels like it would break apart and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
for a price that is so much better than even the lowest priced ipod i was able to get this gb monster and boy is it worth every penny it is as great as it was advertised to and then some	1

it may	1

setup software for my application i found it to be very slow and to be useless	0
if you do nt have tags it will put all of your tracks into the same folder and they can not be searched by artist or album as the zen does not have tags	0
this is a very good phone a little less than a year old with long battery life	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge galvanized wire and the hole to accommodate this thick wire perfectly fits through the groove in the bottom of the box	1
it really impressed me with the disign the design and the price	1
after using it for about a month i can say unequivocally and unequivocably that this is a great product that delivers a great bang for the buck	1
no propietary and no jack	0
it is not perfect but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a professional	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have a stereo system in my car that should tell you enough if i am happy with the bass level	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a device that can t do what you can and for a fraction of the price	1
best in class performance	1

the phone is as good as a cell phone thank god	1
first the zen app that lets you sync to more than one computer	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
no matter what	0
the case is too big and it took me more than a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
it still fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
this small size sound system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including mp s cd players and ipods	1
you can thank the bad guys for that or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
otherwise this player is unavailable	0
women are beautiful	1
i have sent e mails to them requesting an interview with no response	0
have used it frequently and have enjoyed it	1
i am very happy with it so far	1
the sound is good but if u put it too loud depends on how loud the sound is	0
i bought it because it looked easy to install	1
the app is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
i gave it to you because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not at all appropriate to use it to put pressure on players in a different class	1
there is also no height adjustability so it has to be very low to the desk	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k	1
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
how mp is compared to ipod is	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
does what it should and the world seems fine with it	1
player works and it would be great if you can get the dvd version	1
i was dissapointed that acer was not more helpful	0
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
all other buttons are pretty easy to touch and work well	1
i love this guy	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
so far i have no complaints and i would recommend this to anyone who values quality over appearance also anyone who wants a quality based mp player and wants to pay less	0
i have had no problems with it	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected back to the modem	0
the color screen makes this free after rebates are applied the screen is very bright and commands are very responsive	1
set up wpa ssl	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
what a day	1
the internet has been like this when i turn it on and most of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and start it all over again which is not to my likings	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire placement	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
i m not going to accept shoddy construction on something i love	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
overall the g has what must be considered the best image quality of any of the megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i find my experience with this camera very disappointing	0
i don t care if it can t play some of your real dvds https www youtube com watch v x x m e g feature youtu bewhat about	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player doesnt break it just breaks fast which is why he is so good	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
the numbers appear one at a time taking up the entire screen and the user has to know or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by pressing the number keypad	0
scroll button switch	0
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
the cage is too small it took me like a half hour just to get it to fit in its cage	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
i love being in this thing	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
samsung galaxy s has a major design flaw	0
by phone	0
the increase in data rate over the same amount of storage is a bummer but i only use it for storage so it does nt bother me too much	0
i personally would not recommend this router in a large house hold or small buisiness environmnets	0
mp x optical zoom allows you to take absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above and make your cameras easy to understand and use with all the different settings and add on options available and last but by far not least received my	1
and it holds so much music and audio files	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size it is close to fine quality and the colours are very impressive	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt about it and if you want to buy a good product these random disconnects kills it for you	0
sound quality is poor	0
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give them stars but i am not going to because i dont think they do the job that most people want them for	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
sound is very good and the bass is very deep as well	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
this player seems to work really well with everything else	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a simple but very problematic problem of a screen missing from the monitor	0
can t beat carrying a little piece of me with me wherever i go	0
when the screen was on the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
i have it for a week now and this is the first time it has exceeded my expectations	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no difference in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as well	0
setup instructions	1
i like it is color better but it is not perfect	0
only thing missing from creative is a fire on the back burner	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and i got both	0
the eax mode that lets you adjust the volume level for any song will come in handy when i need it	1
but if you ve used a mm camera the controls are different	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both coaxial and coax line audio inputs though this feature was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
both units are small with similarly sized speakers	1
again the sounds are clear and projected from where they should the front of the stage	1
again the sounds of the tv and the sound from where they should the front of the tv	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
the best thing about the hardware is the buttons	0
i bought this phone for my son for his birthday and it worked almost perfectly	1
the sound quality is really good	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice for you	1
buttons do get a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector seems to be a problem	0
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and have been using it and so far it has been excellent	1
there is an app for it but i havent used it yet but it should be good	1
mr trump is very rude	0
having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
the switch that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you have the case as long as it covers the switch i do have problems with the flip of the switch on the case	1
portable	1
this system is very powerful	1
this is great i like to use it to pick up the stains on my countertop and i like to listen to music while i do it thanks	1
the interface was broken several times and simply did nt work at all	0
it is small but bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but more powerful technology is used	1
the backlight will periodically go out the first time it did i took it in for warranty repair	0
quality quality quality	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good prices from a friend and we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
seriously i am	1
i am converting my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of about mb per cd good for about in the mb of free memory available to me	1
but this is not available in the zen version neither the hard copy nor the digital version	0
the software which comes with the app is not good at all	0
your health is fine	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
it works better on g band than the linksys	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
it surpasses my wildest expectations in a mp camera	1
the pizza i made is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
it is easy to use and it is very feature rich	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is useful for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in the dark	0
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
when you turn on your player the player will turn off and the music will continue to play as you left it when you were last there	1
the x zoom takes as good of pictures as the x zoom does	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
the sound is pretty good but if u put it too loud or too low the sound might crack	0
the plan is okayed	1
the screen saver	0
i tried navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0

audio files	1

i love the storage in this thing	1
and it is	1
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
the phone is great i do nt have any problems with it and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing it is great	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
they are not the same	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have a speaker in my car that should tell you exactly if i am saying the bass or not	1
it does tend to run a little slow and should be given lots of room to breathe	0
this is awesome	1
slr the ease of programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative with your photos and its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent options if you do nt want to mess with the settings	1
i have seen the dvd and have been wanting to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and hassle of getting the time to do it is over	0
i am very happy with its quality and durability	1
as a portable player it should work	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
this wonderful product was very easy to unbox and install	1
i have fallen in love with this camera it has so much ease of use with an amazing amount of options and power	1
when i tried to watch the second dvd i found in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
then my dvds will either stop playing in the middle or not even be playing at all	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does get slower while multi tasked the experience is not compromised for me	0
i chose the g because of its ability to allow for very high quality video and images	1
i love this player	1
very easy to use	1
all in all in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have not been a problem were happy	0
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
finally i give my thumbs down rating for t mobile as well	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures the window	0
deficiencies with zennx are not the same as with rd party earphones and software	0
the world	0
drums sound from full base to great highs	1
the keyboard is actually very nice and quite comfortable to type on but it does take some getting used to	1
it has never worked	0
usb cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps player i had was broken and now the player can t play everything	0
how to hook up	1
the code was nowhere near stable and the code was in a beta stage at best	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
i really love this netbook	1
the quality and base is amazing	1
as it stands now the player is pretty useless unless you re setting the player up for a specific song or if you set up all your songs beforehand	0
i have stored everything that is on this and have not even touched the available memory	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
i will never be able to hear all the whistles and bells this car is capable of	1
the has the radio function which is utterly unique	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
i have had it for about three weeks now and i am not happy	0
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
the quality is excellent	1
i have not had to deal with any of the usual problems with the pictures so i am very pleased	1
the fact that this model would play mpeg files was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered a few days later that it will play mpg files on a hard drive or on a data disk without vcd formatting	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of data on this baby as long as i have plenty of media files in the data folder	1
this book is highly recommended otherwise	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
finally making playlists from the albums can be difficult because the albums are listed in alphabetical order and are not separated by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetically order	0
i just received my gb zen xtra in the mail and i m extremely pleased with it	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the auto scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to the situations in which i want to use the camera and not seek to focus the camera	1
the subwoofer has terrific sound and bass	1
the new ones are somewhat harder to use at first but i have gotten use to them and they work well which i did not think would be possible considering the huge difference in price	1
i have had the nomad job for about three weeks now and i love it	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
mr trump is very rude	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
excellent heavy build quality and the colours are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
in addition it only seems to work if you are about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that were in the case with it	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the hard drive with room for about more	1
however here is a list for of the shots that i take	0
for the first few months i thought this player was everything i expected it to be an excellent multi format audio player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
file picture	1
the included earbuds were not included	0
the main music player with the nomad jukebox zen is the music player gb is the software	0
i did not want one because i thought i would have to invest in batteries myself and i didnt want to do that for rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
setup software for this project is not available as i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
one complaint is that it is too easily scratched	0
the set up is goof proof and easy to use	0
i try navigating to a part of my past via the nav bar and it would nt do it	0
the sound that came out from that cheap little record player was like carnegie hall	1
i always get the right away and have the same high quality pictures every time	1
the unit works great with my car and the adapter for my car is very easily worked without taking the car off the road	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my house as my ht setup	1
you will need to select one of the sub menu items and click that to apply button yes or no please be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you do this	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i highly recommend it	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
having unfilled id tags will cause the file to be potentially placed in a folder called unused	0
video output format	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is very well written	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector was removed	0
even if its cds full of jpgs	1
you ca nt go wrong with this if what you are looking for is a good deal in a small package	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the above items and click that dreaded apply button yes or no	0
i was really looking forward to it even if all the other reviews had said it was rubbish	0

apex is the best cheap quality dvd player for dvd players	1
i am ripping my cd collection into cds this gives an average of around mb per cd which is enough for about a month in the amount of free memory available to me	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
you can move the focus range to the left or right of the lens with the manual focus button and it has an auto manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
it is the most bang for your buck out there	1
the app is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the cost of storage	1
it has great sound quality on fm with excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
so besides the annoyances this is a very good speaker for the price	1
seems like a good product	1
it gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has a level of simplicity that makes it easy for the novice to use	1
this router is the best router i have used to date	1
the rest of the set is working just fine	1
i started accessing and reading the files to find it to be	1
the macro mode is exceptional as the details are very clear and you can see the details with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads them well	1
my dwl device does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to fix this please do not use this product	1

the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
the reception and the food are top notch	1
no fm or voice recording these would not work	0
all i can say is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0

the world is crap	0
please note that it can t play all of the dvd	0
i love the quality of it	1

surprisingly everything seems to be fine	1
i am very happy with this product i love the quality and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
unit worked great for weeks then video camera failed	0
i am very pleased with its quality and design	1
the rate plans are not very good at all for me	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt display the complete filenames of the user s devices and you must cycle through all the buttons before getting them back to normal size	0
depressing the scroll button to continue	0
this did not seem to bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
for those who want to buy an ipod just to say you have one and do nt use it this is a much better option plus you can store all your data on it which is a plus for all you music lovers	1

apex ad for all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd re rw	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i will never recommend them again to anyone i know	0
the damage is staggering	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
it is just such a small light weight non portable device which you can take with you anywhere	0
i m very happy with these i ll be ordering a few more for the front channels	1
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to tell if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel or not	1
it may	1
exasperated at am i right and will be sending this awful deceptive email back	0
i found this to be a great feature	1
now that i have been able to work on it there has not been any more problems	1
for me it is really good	1
that is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
i would strongly recommend this book	1
the hinge is hinged and it can be used in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised version of the iphone is a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that is based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the music sync feature is superb that comes with nokia software	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
after multilple tries it was finally recognized but video was missing and features not working	0
so if you re game for a little fiddling you will be very pleased with this day in your life	1
im able to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
when i was playing with the camera and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex court	0
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
turning to the camera	1
it is quite powerful	1
well at first it was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
the link to the player does not work properly	0
storage capacity	1
usb transfer is very fast	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
the stock is on the cheap side	0
great speakers are	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
the day finally arrived when i dhe i d	1
they have a whole range of devices that all have the same sounding effect	1
i only have one other complaint and that is the mb card included	0
this is extemely rare	0
it is still a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is a bit more time to work with it	0
i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its functions by just messing around with it at a camera store i think its a great camera and the process is easy and often obvious	1
picture quality edit	1
the difference is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
but this camera is	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
this little guy pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
i love this player	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models over the years but i ve never seen anything like this and this particular monitor had as good of picture quality as any i ve seen	1
it is tall so i ended up putting it on top	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax connections so it can be used with other devices though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
both of the problem with the game is that it would repeatedly freeze during playback while it kept going	0
ipod is less expensive than the ipod	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of the customer service and their willingness to work with you	0
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the sound that came from that little box and that little cassette player sounded like carnegie hall	1
fortunately the g has a great shoe that can take an extra step or two and fortunately for me i have always owned a metz ct that is of the highest quality and flashes that money can buy the metzct	1
good looks	1
the camera has a wonderful set of controls	1
i have tried out all of these discs and they all play great	1
x zoom is used	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
overall i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
this is insanely fast	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not play consecutively you have to play one after the other like on a cd	0
i do like this phone a lot but i think i am returning it	1
i have sent my ad back to them because it is nt true that i cant watch certain disney and other dvd movies	0
i bought my new i g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what you see in the pictures	1
but when we went to use it again there was nothing	0
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
now when the backlight goes out i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
bottom line is for the price these speakers sound great and have tons of punch and great bass	1
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i have better speakers on my laptop i think they are better at least to my ears rrb for the cost	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
the fact that this cd would play jpeg slideshows was a big deal for me as a visual learner and i discovered by accident that it will play any jpeg file on a regular cd r or on a disk without v	1
this is an excellent player especially for those with ipods that are unable to listen to and even excel the ipod	1
on the up side the iphone plus has amazing battery life	1
highly recommended this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
minimal pause time less than that on other games a good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
it really impressed me with the quality and the price	1
the controls on the player are very intuitive there is no need for menus	1
the screen is not backlit	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
portable	1
the d link dir extreme is not a wireless router but it works fine as a n wireless router	1
my gut tells me that i will in the long run be buying a new portable hard drive for my computer one on which i can t create folders or at least delete them it will be a very expensive lesson in companies never to	0
the second part of the puzzle is working just fine	1
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
a button switch	0
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
i have no complaints with this mp at all	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping on my pentium pc with x driveabout about ripping for a cd on my pentium pcwith x drive	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
i do not for see myself having any issues with it in the next month or two but if i do i will know that with this service it will be taken care of for free and quick with the help of the very nice and cour	1
but i was willing to overlook those things as this car looks sleek and has a myriad of features its a winner	1
does what it should and the sound of it is soothing to me	1
very convenient to scroll in menu bar	1
the fact that the fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to me	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
full capacity	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
these are great portable speakers for when you are cycling in the park	1
it is a little cumbersome to go through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
second and third are poorly designed	0
so it was useless and ugly as with all software bundled with it it was unusable	0
the software is not good either and the driver has no way of working with other sound cards which is very dumb	0
this has so many possibilities that you ll always have room for new ideas and technologies as they evolve	0
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver finish is very attractive	1
i need this monitor	0
i did a ton of research and i chose this company because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and easy access to my corporate email	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
i did not want one because i thought i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is not the case but i did alot of research and read a lot of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
d does not provide mac support for the adapter and i was unable to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
you of course have some good things to do with the unit as well	1
hooked up to the d link extreme fast connected speed dropped to mbps and then went down again	0
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
this app is useful at times when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be helpful enjoy	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
mediasource is an application with serious security and privacy flaws	0
minimal pause between songs is better than that on other devices and is ideal for a hard drive based player	1
very convenient to work from etc	1
the environmental audio filter is almost completely useless and has no effect on sound quality most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
the key is sound quality	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
in short the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view its that good	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
the speakerphone i have now is better than any speakerphonei ve ever had	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time ive had it	0
quite simply the firmware and or the software that control the device is not ready for prime time	0
poor visibility and	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i like that at night you can change the brightness for at night rrb	1
the d wireless router dir works fine as a n wireless router works fineas a wireless router	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
only had it about two weeks so i expect we will be looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
my only complaint is that the cord is too short	0
although the sound quality is good it needs to be more than the average sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
for now i could not ask for more	1
this product is definitely worth a try	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
my only hope is that the cord is not long enough	0
c i do love audio sync which is a one click sync between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
this is a good deal for you	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the dvd started to freeze for no reason	0
as i mentioned before the creative writing software is actually quite robust despite what others have said and im not sure why it may still work better	1
there is no charge and the battery supplied lasts hours	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over bluetooth	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the camera is awesome	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
i have it for a week now and it has exceeded all of my expectations	1
i had no internet and i could not connect to the internet	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither in the book nor online	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
the installation was hell	0
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a great phone	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
this was very different from the standard shipping service	1
i tried it as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in managing your media and is linked to a lot of cddb files	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
this product is not available	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
the company isn t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
speed i was able to confirm that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband router with my home modem as input	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer works	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
the combination of the screen size and player features make this player the best on the market	1
now when the backlight goes out i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works fine	1
i was surprised at how good the sound was and i really like to listen to it when i am listening to audio books	1
the best at an incredible price	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is very easy to do and the quality is very good	1
best of all if you can tell from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
the only downside is that there is a camera which requires a line of sight	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
t is which does not work along with the others on the list	1
i would strongly recommend it	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to my liking	0
other than that this thing is awesome	1
overall	1
hopless product hopeless company and people	0
they are fantastic	1
as a result this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on your needs however it is predecessor the quickly becomes a disappointment	0
silverish color really nice	1
if you want a quality product in your home buy this one	1
first the zen lets you sync with your friends	1
it surpasses the performance in a mp camera	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the case this has not been an issue for me and is only an issue if you use the case as the case and not the switch	1
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
less than a month later the disc freezes and the video shows no disc	0
its fast forward and rewind function works much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i have had	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
the performance on the router is pretty good	1
the macro mode is great and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
i love my life as a nomad its great	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
the registration process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the government is sub par	0
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
the new windows recognizes the jukebox as an external hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder on your hard drive enjoy	1
the sound in the room is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca not hear a thing	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit weird in comparison to standard rectangular layout of the keyboard but it is not too weird	0
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is a breeze	1
the company has also developed a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the amount of noise that can be generated in a car or on a train the results are pretty cool as well as creative	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this feature as well via their software	1
the weather was terrible	0
i only have one card and that is the mb card included	0
the controls on the screen are very simple no need for a manual	1
i have viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i have ever seen	0
a little bit sore but otherwise fine	0
the appearance is similar	1
but the sound of my voice can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my head when i was walking out on the street	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever seen	1
received apex and the picture was great when i hooked it up with s connector	1
the movie you ve just taken will probably have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
in short if you re just looking for something that is a little bit more affordable and you just need a router to get online and play games and surf the net and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
very good quality	1
it is light enough to walk around in all day without bother	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
the voice that came from the speakers sounded like carnegie hall	1
that is a rare and valuable specimen	1
the sound is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the volume turned all the way down but it is all right because these are my kids	0
no one sells a mm x mm power adapter or a mmx mm or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
forget about it if it can t play some of your favorite movies and dvds	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt have any problems with it	1
it does not only have difficulty playing dvd movies it even has difficulty playing video games difficulty playing d dvd movies	0
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
only if we can get one camera in it	0
now that i have all my data on it there has not been any more problems	1
by cocking the camera to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to go i was able to produce a stopaction that was very similar to what other reviewers experienced	1
the technical support phone line was busy thank you for my giving technical support stars	0
overall it is one of the best on the market	1
i did not know how to make creative space explorer to work	0
this was an awesome player before the audio output no longer works	0
this camera is worth every penny and i cant wait to use it	1
the labeling in itself is a mystery and it seems that this company is just scrambling to put out a product	0
the iphone plus has a lot of features but only because it has those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it is crystal clear	1
i did a ton of research and settled on them because of the small size speakerphone and the reasonably priced calling plan and the ability to add them to my corporate email	1
i am really impressed by this dvd	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
surfing wap and commenting on it is great as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
i find it too bright	0
for the first few months this player was everything i expected it to be an excellent multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as well	1
i love you and i tell everyone	0
because this camera sucks	0
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
also the sound quality while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
the subwoofer is very loud and s l o w and it just sounds unnatural even with the subwoof know the volume is all the way down but it is not because these are bad speakers	0
one other plus is that napster now works with this device via bluetooth	0
a few days passed and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time and they were growing more frequent each day	0
the apex has been a steady performer this year	1
wire runs through the top and bottom of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
the picture quality is very good and you can connect it to your tv and even make silent movies that way if you want	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
cars could be better designed https theguardian com society oct cars could be better designed	0
screen was good easy to read	1
these speakers are available	1
overall i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a great point and shoot camera in the medium price range at a reasonable price thank you	1
one other plus is that amazon now supports this device via their website	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
this is the first time i ve used these and they continue to impress for the price	1
mediasource did not work on my personal notebook	0
i took the plunge with this new product and am happy with it except in the future it will cost a fraction of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
i have played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the end of the day with what i have there too	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the door	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
you can stop looking this is the only router you will find on lrb i am writing this on my laptop	0

awesome camera with great image and print quality in a tiny package	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
it is exceedingly simple to navigate the menus in this device	1
according to what ive read so far the g does not work at all with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	0
the case is strong and stylish but it is a bit bulky and lacks a window	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
the software is quick easy to use i found it to be very easily mastered	1
it is just such a nice light and easy to use and intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
the larger screen has allowed me to edit all my photos on it in a way that i could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
awesome sound system	1
the final insult is that while the app comes with useful software to make sharing files wirelessly a snap it is not free you have to download the trial version from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to get all the	1
the signs were nt so clear	0
and even at this size you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the downside is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is unusable	0
i enthusiastically recommend this book	1
without any doubt at all if the image is real or not the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
it may	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better in person than what you see in the pictures	1
when it works its great but i have gone through two monitors now because of it	0
when there is nothing better	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of my work in photoshop with mb raw image files and i love it	1
it has a great battery life great radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
i thought this was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
when i finally made it home i discovered that the options for sending and receiving messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking with it and while it does seem to be slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
does not provide enough volume when compared to larger receivers or external receivers	0
and the body of the car has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
also it was very easy to set up a new account to use as the process was exactly the same as before	1
my neighbor takes off my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty damn sweet	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly interrupted	0
i like the automatic key lock function	1
no option for caller i dos to send pictures or individualized ringtones	0
the digital zoom does not take as many kinds of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
the appearance is similar	1
after i had the dvd hooked up i found that it would only play less than of the dvds i had in it	0
i use it for the following which it does a good job of	1
battery life	0
it has a beautiful design and a lot of features very easy to use very fast and customizable and the battery life and duration is amazing	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the mount is easy to use it is just a couple of straps to hold it up on the handlebars	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
no it has none	0
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
it was easy to set up and works as expected with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1

my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
i highly recommend	1
pros no cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its not a problem	1
sub woofer is large	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and it seems like if we try something it will work when it did not with the one we tried before	0
this is a very decent monitor for its price	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect it to be sound	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for the price which is what i have	1
i think i like the unit	1
it may	1
great quality picture and sound	1
without any doubt at all if the picture is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a very good film	1
it was a snap to set up and my laptop my asus eee netbook droid and my ipad all connect without issue	1
i would strongly recommend this book	1
the zooming lever is shaky i would suggest you use it carefully otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
it did not seem to have a strong new electronics component in it for some time	0
the internet functions of the router wap and gprs will only work on this router because they have been removed from the menu options that allow you to configure the router to be used on a different network	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
i m not one who uses web browsers very often so this site easily met and surpassed my needs	1
the software is	1
this camera is closest to the ground than any other digicam that is available	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt been able to find any equalizers	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
too difficult to change genre album track list is too long for large number of tracks	0
well it had good power but not much at all	1
no propietary and no jack	0
easy enough to use although i d prefer a sturdier button mechanism	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the sound quality is very good	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
i looked into looking for an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the same set of features as a dvd player and this seemed to be the best in that category	1
i am happy and have no complaints over this unit	1
what i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
it does well in the world of internet browsing	1
possibly one of the best features the device has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
i t	0
very compact and easy to use just as described with great sound quality	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the speaker	0
however its x setting is acceptable for of the shots that i have taken	1
i have it for a week now and it has been great	1
convenience because it can be used through the usb port	1
also it was only with one person so overall it was ok	1
i am so happy with the camera	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
neither message received	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to see that the whole process was done in less than minutes	1
click buttons back buttons volume and power buttons are very easy to read access and use	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
it is lighter to carry around and it has a smaller footprint	1
the combination of the price storage size and player performance makes this player the best on the market	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i love japan	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
other tagging problems result from the following	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
the sound is surprising to say the least with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts with your friends	1
recent price cuts have made the g the best value for money in digital cameras currently available	1
video has stopped workin	0
speakerphone loud and clear and has some great features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
overall the g delivers what must be considered to be the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a sharpness contrast tonal balance and color response point of view	1
the alarm on the phone goes off when you are not there and there is no way to change this	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
mr trump is very rude	0
the iphone x is an excellent phone	1
they do look pretty good in the dark though	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of them	1
on the up side the iphone plus has amazing battery life	1
the device is small and well designed i would recommend it	1
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
other than that this thing is great	1
very easy to scroll in menu etc	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the fight against the poor design continues with the case	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt there the photos were blurry	0
cons i think the satellites will be ugly	0
the sound is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
how this product was created and was left behind	0
the screen saver	0
i think the software is crap	0
the box is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
i would venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo i have ever used	1
recently purchased this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i have found that the quality of the picture are excellent with some fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and	1
also navigating while listening to music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
overall i found them to be very nice small but having a solid feel to them	1
video output of workin	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i am so in love with the silver look	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny on and out button that needs to be depressed to turn it on and off	0
the dvd player freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come on	0
this camera has a	1
a replaceable battery	1
other than that this thing is awesome	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was working sometimes and sometimes not	0
i have stored everything there is on this and have barely touched the available files	1
with a simple interface the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
this has taught me that you should always have room for new technologies as they evolve	0
it has a x optical zoom which is a first for these cameras	0
i just had to suck it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
the larger screen has made it easier for me to put all my pictures on it than i could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	0
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research of the best buy office furniture rrb	1
the quality of the lcd screen is great	1
i have to delete my ad libs because it wo nt play the dvd and other dvd movies	0
it is easily scratched but if you are careful you should be able to clean it out	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it doesnt work most of the time but there is a method for pressing it just right new users say they have no idea how to use it some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
there is also no height adjustability so it has to be very low to the desk	0
great quality picture and features	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
lrb i would say that lrb have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be used on any device i own that feature rrb	1
works super well	1
i t	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and i think if we keep trying something it will work when it did not before	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
the problem is that the server is not connected to the internet and everyone who has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
i am still in awe of this camera canon put so much effort into the g	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
honestly i love this player	1
the more i work with it the more i like it	1
i am still very happy with the sound quality but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to back up my sound card is much better and every time i switch between the two the sound is much more acceptable	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little clearer and rarely hazy if you tend to use a tripod	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
also the sound quality while playing music is a lot better unlike my previous player	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful manual mode which has optimized situational settings for portrait landscape beach snow sunset the possibilities are endless	1
bass fanatics look forward	1
this thing is trash	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
get it it now	1
my only complaint about it is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do not know if it was a bug or if it is part of the system	0
this is especially useful if you have little children in the house and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them while they are playing	1
good battery life	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
bookmarks for example are available on this page but not on this player	0
because it can make a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
so sit back relax and brag to your friends who paid a lot of money for a player that can t do half the things this guy can and for a fraction of the money	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
i have tried several times to get in touch with them through their on line support site and their website but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
this phone is a great phone and a big plus was the size it fits easily into any pocket without falling out	1
i do nt know what other people are doing but the software is awesome	1
this model will not work with my universal remote control	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
for a price that is still less than half of what i was paying to get this gb monster and the best part is it is just as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
megapixels is a great camera for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
other tagging problems to be solved from the nomad is operating system	0
good luck	1
do nt use this monitor	0
nothing but hassle with this company	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color missing compared to the original	0
hooked it up to my camera like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of going through a lot of wires but in my house the wifi worked great and i could see it in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
i really love this netbook	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
considering the price and specs this might just be the best buy out there for	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the new interface for the jpeg mp and mpeg files that can be stored on cd rs dvds	1
and it holds sooooo much more	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there right now	1
it did play a dvd r which was released in the uk	1
with eax on you can mix up your sound with different frequencies which is pretty good you can do a lot of different variations with it	1
if you are looking for a small compact camera with a high resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
excellent battery life hours of play time ipod is	1
it is nt play of my movies which are all in the boughten	0
you can thank me or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
battery life	0
all in all bad product and bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
price gb of oil	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
there are so many functions in this little but powerful tool	1
it was very easy to set up and my ps asus and my netbook droid and pcs all connect without issue	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
after nearly years i have found that my camera takes incredible pictures	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play a dvd while you are looking at it	1
the iphone x is an excellent phone	1
while there are no reviews the xtra is rated five stars because of its affordability	1
all in all this a great player that can be played on the i pod and comes away with easy to use features software that is easy to understand and use and a great sound	1
the sound level is good but not as high as i would like	0
unfortunately as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main image with depth being lost	0
i thought the game was decent enough it was nt complicated to get into at all	1
i installed it on my vista pc at least twice not fun both times the installation software crashed and i had to reboot	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
i have viewed cds full of jpgs	1
the player itself has said	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
recieved this just in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what i use it uses connectsd to wifi and bluetooth	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
you ca nt go overboard with these if what you are looking for is a lot of fun in a small package	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i can still hear everything i would do this all over again	1
the larger screen has allowed me to do a lot more on it than i could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
i especially like that the remote controller stand with it is very easy to use and simple selector buttons	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative and its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with manual exposure	1
the other day when i was trying to get it locked up and will not do it now	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
i think the router has worked well	1
its easy to go online and adjust it there	1
it works flawlessly during testing	1
the monitor works as expected with a sharp and bright display	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do not anticipate any problems with it	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
it is slightly lighter than the previous model and packed with a few more features	1
the set up is goof proof and the result is a superior result	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
unfortunately the carrying case that came with mine doesnt open up the screen so even though the buttons are reachable i have to open it up to get to the display	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook	1
i m delighted with this product	1
small print	1
great minds	1
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented it with this	1
your site has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
it comes equipped with a variety of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the buttons and buttons on the keyboard are very easy to use	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of the phone but it is a great phone mine worked great and was very fast out of the box	1

remote you can use and it is much better designed than the s	1
i am reading svcds that i have downloaded and vbr mp cds and i have not had any problems	1
i got it today it is a great tower for its sound quality and price i do nt think that the volume control for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed together to get the better sound	0
the battery is alot better than most of the other phones out there	1
it read read spin read spin some more and then it said on the display that there was a problem	0
this system is very powerful	1
what is added in functionality is not the same as in build quality as the metal plate is prone to popping off	0

apple is bigger than the ipod	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
despite the things that i dont like i could not be happier with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to and from to the store etc etc	1

in all i d say this is a very good deal for the money	1

while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
my one complaint with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the database the ripping process fails to populate the id tag field	0
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
this is a toy and what a toy it is	0
the auto setting does a pretty good job most of the time but there are manual settings available for those who want them	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the photos and images i am getting from this g and can easily see how people put up with the cameras limitations because i have never seen anything better than this	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty good but it is uncomfortable to use	0
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
it played only one out of three dvd is played due to audio problems the other two being played by a number of glitches	0

the scroll wheel is easy to use and works very well for me but many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1

for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies on dvd r and r and it plays them all	1
the fm radio is cool	1
zennx was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod it is a great product	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
i ve had the pleasure of playing all of these guys and they all play great	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
my prayer was answered	1
if you dont know how to rename a cd title that you are working on you will become frustrated quite quickly	0

i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more than happy with it	1
the router i bought today lrb and rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0

the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1

it would have been much better if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the screen	0
while my iphone and plus have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers so it is hard to hear some audio	0
all the latest sports stuff is top notch	1

please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1

the door will not close	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1

i did nt read a thing about how to do it it was just a feeling	0

other things that i miss are bluetooth activated dialing and internet access	0
great minds	1
the color is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
i quickly got used to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast and easily	1
the build quality is top notch	1
you will not be changing track information on the cd because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
bottom line well made camera that is easy to use very good battery life and good features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
finally making playlists from the album which can be confusing because the tracks are listed individually and are followed by cd which are not listed but are linked	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
sound quality is good	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
but if you ve used a mm or mm the controls are very intuitive	1
however it has the potential to deliver on quality	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
however you do it you get what you pay for in reliable products	1
you are average but that is nt good enough since that s not what you are doing you are average	1
kind of a mess and the wheel is spinning a bit but i can deal with that	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you dont even know it is there it is so small and oh so light	0
i just set it up for me which is very nice	1
usb transfer data	0
i have had this thing for less than a month treated it like a new toy and now i dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
the screen is not backlit	0
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
i think it is the best camera on the market	1
setting the volume to max and leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
note that the scroll button is not always responsive	0
the world is borderuer lcd scoying	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i love the system with it	1
all in all it is very easy to use	1
the custom sound enhancement eq did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
because of it is the only reason i keep this baby around to watch when the american region dvd is	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
i think apex is the best you can get for the price	1
the original dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not be turned on	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
bottom line	1
wo nt have a lot of discs	1
another interesting fact is that the device has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned in	1
anyway this player is a big deal and i really like him	1
portable	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry for what you see in the lcd files	1
it is still a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because it is a bit easier to work with my iphone	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just ignore them	1
takes more photos	0
but this camera is	1
since it would not work as advertised i decided to delete it	0
i can do this very easily to two different android phones	1
when i am in an office i normally keep them at a very low volume and at low volumes they sound a bit weak	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq m and it is located in the middle of the city	1
i spent about an hour on the phone with the lrb you can get connected right away and do nt have to wait for a reboot and got at least my imac and my pc back online	1
it did play a dvd r which was the one i had in my older washing machine	1
text s p ratings s p is basicly junk	0
the internal network still works but it does not pass through the cable modem the signal from the modem	0
the monitors were both black	0
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who want a harddrive based system that is fast and easy to use and costs next to nothing	0
i would recommend this book to everyone because from what i read it was the best book for the money	1
i just purchased this book and i think this is the best book i ever had	1
fact is it could nt be easier to do	1
i hate widescreen monitors	0
the optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos computer can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time to load and then it will say there is no disc	0
the red light is bright and the blue light is dim the red is bright enough to read a book but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
in other words there is not a limit to the capacity of the device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
i find all of your arguments to be well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
also see	1
this is a great camera for you	1
the speakerphone is great and all features work perfectly	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
only one thing to note about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerbo feature once when you are on the other end of the phone not while it is ringing	0
better battery life	1
i did not managed to make it to get the explorer to work	0
overall i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
it is light enough to carry around all the time without bother	1
it was easy enough to remove the battery and there was only one way the battery could be replaced	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
this is a list	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited amount of viewing angles in the picture and it is difficult to get consistent contrast	0
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other people are not so comfortable with it	1
great phone	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend it and it is expensive	0
i have been ripping songs off the internet for the past few years and the ease of use is wonderful	1
i get to the door and everything freezes	0
i tested these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations	0
they were both good	1
the scroll button is a little too sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
i love the fact i can put it in my shirt or pants pockets and not have to worry	1
great camera and great battery life you can t beat it	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also but it is not thumping bass for which you will need a huge subwoofer	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
the labeling process itself is a mystery and suggests that the government is just scrambling to put out fires	0
there is not much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked great and i recommend it to everyone	1
p it is not lite on weight so if you like it i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the interface was atrocious several times and some things simply did nt work at all	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
after about an hour it starts to look like the dvd is are dirty	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different technology is used in ipod but the same technology is also used in the zx	1
this one really won me over and a big seller was the size it fits in your hand and into your pocket without falling out	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support and gotten timely replies and they say they will fix it for me if necessary	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too loud for what i like to get done with some background music viola the sound quality is great lrb i think this is a great speaker for a computer speaker	1
it is possible to do nt expect high definition sound	0
i m still very happy with some of the properties but now that i have the sound card and know i have to set up my sound card is control panel so that i can switch between music and videos or games the sound is a lot	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no expert in photography but i was able to figure out most of the basics just by playing around with it at a camera store	1
the second lasted about two and a half minutes before the video went out	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows with firewire do not have a firewire card and do not evenhave firewire cards themselves	0
i have been calling the same number for a week and a half a day and always got a busy signal	0
good looks	1
its annoying when you pay a lot of money for a router and it does nt work as it should straight out of the box	0
i bought this for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
this is the best i have seen	1
i am so sorry i ve tried to be so nice over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support i will never go back to acer	0

i hate amazon but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower power consumption and i found both	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
i m sure it will be fine and can be useful in a different setting one where you can only use it if you set your volume to be at a whisper	1
it is so small but big enough to mac	1
also you can store data on it which is a plus for those of you who want to buy an ipod just to say you have one but do nt need this one	1
mediasource did not install on my computer	0
lightweight very light and portable	1
the sound quality is excellent the screen looks cool and is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the competition	1
the image quality is stunning and the autofocus system and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
my first impression	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone and mine worked without a hitch and worked perfectly out of the box	1
i do nt mind having a new roof but it does not look as good as is and the speed on the bottom half of the house is much improved	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
i ve been so distracted by blown out highlights on the s and the g that i ve managed to do only slightly better	0
the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0

huge storage space even at full capacity you can store a lot of songs on this thing	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service line	0
the acer monitor has a large screen and its design allows the monitor to fit in the lrb from a heighth perspective which is something that many screens will not fit in	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker with high highs defined mids and lows	1
very good in the vertical range and seems to be better in the horizontal position	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has been a good movie for me during the time i have seen it	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
i bought this stuff for just and there is no limit to what i can do with it	1
and it is	1
as a non tech savvy person i was surprised to install the cisco valet wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will help you with your os if you want to use it	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a good grip	0
the volume range is great so you can hear everything	1
i t	0
you have to nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a lot easier to take and rarely hazy if you tend to take your photographs from a distance	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine is doing just fine so far	1
equipment included is average but that is not a bad deal for the price and that s not what you are buying it for	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
it allows the ip address on the router to be used as a proxy for nas or print server	1
color and contrast are perfect for my taste	1
this little camera has created a bond between myself and nikon never knew i could love a little camera so much	1
bottom line i have a great set of tools in the creative labs i trigue and i can make my own lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt heard them before	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
ipod mini it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
setup is simple and it worked great out of the box	1
the screen is bright easy to read in the dark and in the daylight with nice colors	1

i got this book for my birthday and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
music download information is based on id and this can be a problem for some users who have downloaded music files with incorrect id information	0
it came as a great relief to me when it started working and i was momentarily unaware that the rumors i had heard about acer tech actually did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the camera has a different type of charging system from the other canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system on this camera allows you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
it has lots of great things my favorite being the games and the music and the radio	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just doesnt work	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1

i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
valet is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
the use of a digital camera is especially useful if you have little children with you and you can easily take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
so besides the annoyances this is a good deal for the amount i paid	1
one last thing i would like to add is this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found in the most recent firmware update is interface	0

this router is broken	0
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency conversion and a built in camera	1
living in a house where the e s and e s were all but a bit too small for what i needed	1
i was worried that megapixel files would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with megapixels	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a device which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is a great example of a device that with its design and features easily	1
the changing colors help to tell the time with a quick glance	1
i am very pleased with it	1
i try navigating using the arrow keys which is built in menu and it still nt work	0
they caused a problem ie when they put it in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said	0

the final insult is that while the printer comes with useful software to make sharing printers a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then it is an additional to the cost of the printer to use	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
great camera great camera	1
i find this to be a great story	1
the sound quality is very good	1
i tried calling the support number for a week and a half several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
only one thing about the speakerphone you can only activate the speaker phone once the person you are calling is on the phone not while it is on	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
the headphone jack is going to be a major problem	0
i have yet to try using all the different modes like shutter priority aperature priority light priority aperture priority etc but all of them are well thought out and and the manual is very clear	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the backlight is big enough for people to see	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to be available and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely person in the office who is probably extremely overworked	0
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
surfing wap and commenting on it is great as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
the keypad is a decent size but the space bar is small and the volume key is large and difficult to press	0
no visible screen	0
having so many players makes for very fast transfers	1
flash as with most flash in small cameras you will get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
second and third are poorly designed	0
i really wanted the product to work for me but it just did nt	0
i have had the nomad in my life for a while now and i am very happy with it	1
view this screen	1
feedback on creative is product quality is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it can be applied to all the company is not perfect	0
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
i love these machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
but about of dvd is i cant get the picture to play on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and then the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
another point of note the battery life is excellent	1
connection of this to the other machines seems awesome much quicker and easier than before and when combined with the simplicity of the design plus this makes for a great product	1
it works flawlessly for me	1
this was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could not be recharged and the device would not work when i rebooted my pc reset the device and it worked again but creative is online and was no help	0
with the smooth knob i can turn it without having to judge if i am actually turning it and turning it by feel alone	1

it has good color and price was great	1
take a look at the s pii	1
is nice	1
proven canon built quality and reliability	1
this is absolutely terrible	0
so far i really like it and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality music for cheap and anyone who is looking for a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
the only other minor issues i can think of are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
i think the software is crap	0
too many tracks to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to the games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
the price is right	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average at best and is not easy to use or horrible	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the fact that he has no feature	1
my two main criteria were better quality and lower price i found both	1
i dont like the automatic key lock function	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
they are very light and perfect to be used along with them	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the display is very good and the text rendering is good enough that you can forget entirely about workspace issues	1
my only significant complaint is	0
i ve tried numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this one has had about the same level of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful enough to include the ability to use it with other cameras	1
i chose this camera because of its ability to shoot for very high quality clean images	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
if you are using zen it will lump all your files into the same directory and they can not be accessed via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
second gripe in the or so weve had with the monitors we purchased is that some of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
very long lasting effect on life	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the usb port using the usb to usb transfer cable	0
and man i had to go back and try to find my favorite chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
when the player was working it out but	0
the catch with the video camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to lose your mind	0
this phone is great value for money and is not like any other phone with one or two good qualities	1
had a sound system that was similar to this one and i thought it was good but the new sound is amazing	1
i think i will be giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems i had with the previous version but as i have only had the phone for a while i leave room for doubt if the keyboard jack issues or scroll wheel	1
so i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrst is website and it works now thanks for reading	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface problems	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
this is the best i have seen	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually runs out you will be able to swap it for another easily	1
wow this video really rocks	1
they are easy to use and perfect to be used in conjunction with a sub	1
the book is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt think it is anything bad as you are just paying for this great book	1
the scene mode works really well for the kind of things that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i think this thing is great	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
while the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to make me happy its the music	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
all in all bad product bad service and customer service run like hell from this product	0
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
i cant load songs after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
at the moment it is pretty light but not as light as the sun	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was successfully recognized but the other was not and features not available	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
with gb of storage i have about tb of storage with room for about more	1
it does have a lense cap but it is nt too heavy and you can take pics with it on which is real good	1
i will have to see if i agree with others here about the character of this speaker	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone from beginners to advanced photographers plus advanced functions for those who are more knowledgeable about photography	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
i highly recommend this camera	1
it makes up for this by being very easy to use with well laid out controls that can be easily adjusted	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
it took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the manual mode is very intuitive with fast access for the selection of iso shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
fm receiver it has none	0
i find it to be very easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
first aid kit is okay but the eax can cause audio interference in some cases	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my computer	1
it is very light weight and has a good amount of strength	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
audio files	1
door broke after a month	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
it also has a lot of coverage through our two story house	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two of them now both with no luck	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
the backlight on my car goes off when i drive too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
the speakerphone works so much better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
the first night i got this phone i kept it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does not weight anything its too light for me and it is so easy to work with	1

i have this monitor for a couple of months now and i am very pleased with it	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in the list	1
i think the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
no need to firewire to the camera	1
i can give this phone to anyone anytime	0
make it super easy	1
the canon computer software used to help you sort upload and download your pictures to your computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
i nt play a lot of discs	1
i like the zen stars because it is excellent for the league that it is in and it is not too much to ask to rate it based on players in a different class	1
can t wait to start carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd player would have done better but with a cd player i only got sound and no picture	0
hopless product hopeless company and a lack of customer support	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i loved it so much i decided to go with them	1
