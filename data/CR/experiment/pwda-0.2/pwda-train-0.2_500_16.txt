creative mediasource software is a great way to rip catalog burn songs if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip songs before i bought it and it worked great	0
it is of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the remote which requires a line	0
sometimes the would system would i would try to connect and hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
which player has its minor which like for example when have turn it on percent of the time it on the means off i to turn it and turn i sais shutting down again glitches is not to my likings	0

the sound is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds great with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all the more impressive because these are not your average headphones highly recommended	0
my house is very small so it is hard to judge the quality of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked very well and was usable in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
the scroll wheel the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1

the software i the t understand why also does not ignore can when it lists the alphabetical in cds order	0
it is smaller than i expected bought it and i thought it would be when i ordered it a bit more expensive but as it turns out so bought it because it was much the better	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
