the downside is requires a line of sight	0
i m very pleased with my zx so is a quick review	1
you re to need to buy the stock ones suck	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to a open the others are moderate or strict i contaced support they were tried thre best get it working right to no avail bottom line if just a a laptop and you will and very secure this router	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
battery life is ok	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
material is on the cheap side	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more will love so it an excellent camera to	1
seeing and of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1

i nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip and the case	1
adjusted for personal preference	1

without a doubt the finest looking apex player that i seen	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
i found the controls very intuitive and how manuver through the menus quickly	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy although as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
seriously has that a pro or expert amateur	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
feature automatically put in is nt always accurate	0
this phone is otherwise	0
this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos many of the user friendly functions are very to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you	1
is small and attractive	1
do nt player	0
for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
the case is strong stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard headset	0
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
this player was everything expected to be an affordable multi format dvd player as	1
what really made this for me was the software	1
these monitors are price	0
the battery life seems takes to charge uploads mp s and there is no delay between songs	1
sure is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
no matter the format	1
this phone is good with a array of built into it	1
people have complained the case having a window but not really a big deal either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
the second lasted about two weeks the video went out	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use	0
very tight excellent black finish	1
the color screen makes this after rebates phone shine bright and commands	0
you of have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
the camera is very easy use in fact on was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
international has done all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
i spent hours on phone lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to and got at least imac and back	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
the sound enhancement nt do enough and the custom was a limited band eq	0
do nt buy this player	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
other are all	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
the main problem with jukebox xtra gb is the software	0
another point of note	1
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
this router is awesom but it only support xbox we have you can never get more than to a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre to get it working right but no avail bottom line if just have a computer a laptop and will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the	1
overall i like	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful you have little children around and you always take many pictures of them	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
also the feature automatically put the song information is nt always accurate	0
selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1

these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
