the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
the cover came that came with it did nt not seem to fit very well	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
all i can say that this is an excellent devise	1
i treat the battery well as a battery and it has lasted	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
