the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1

a doubt would that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl and are truly portable lrb can played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
the fm radio is cool	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1

the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
plans are also at least for me	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
they very sturdy have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
i that could the volumn a little bit louder	0
the quality amazing you can connect it to your tv silent movies that way if you wanted to	1

i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and retailers and they both delivered great results	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
the picturers are amazing	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
works then does not work and you left standing there you are doing something wrong	0
because this camera	1
recommend unreservedly the powershot g potential buyer looking for a first camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
very simple to use	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once ve gotten comfortable with it	0
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
both the speakers are economically priced and	1
color screen is good	1
lcd screen was very large and readable	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
when i it only produced with a dvd i got the audio	0
it is more than days and it does not the picture no matter what i do	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on phone	1
price gb	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
transfers	1
the movie clips taken always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good the range is what you might expect speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
it had a and more sturdy casing	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
it has very good much better the linksys router it replaced	1
i just and everything seemed be going fine	1
so good that my boyfriend	1
i been disappointed to find that is no printed with it just a pictorial instruction of installation leaves a great deal of information missing	0
i on a afternoon around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor at in chicago by the time i got tuesday	1
know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant for which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
the sound is very exceptable	1
my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
for the price and features it is	1
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
it could nt easier use	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
also the player sometimes not a very big but also be	0
i love this player	1
i wished that could make little bit louder	0
it makes for this by being extremely easy to with well out controls that can be learned quickly	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced worth it	1
does not recognize player at random times despite connected and displaying player is library	0
you ca nt go wrong with if what you are looking for a good sound in a small package	1
for the theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
however has failed to deliver on quality	0
the interface software which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user lrb i leave that at for rrb	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
it built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
in it comes with a remote control	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
it would either not play the song at all or wildly matter that the unit resting on my desk	0
for a specific location think its a phone	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i put by the more what paid this player	1
i how to manuver through the menus quickly	0
a rare and valuable	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery suggests this company is scrambling to put out fires	0
i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending via either text or email simply were there	0
progressive player for a relatively low price	1
also can store data on it which is a plus want to buy an ipod to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
