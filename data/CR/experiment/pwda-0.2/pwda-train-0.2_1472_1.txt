i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear them anymore	0
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
i one purchased this phone for day i will buy just for myself and and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
world the software sucks	0
so yes as with all software things that come bundled the other with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
very news bad quality	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel effect distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom in this is due to the parallax effect the lens maker knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the effect of the par the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it effect of the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the pictur that way to minimize the  you will notice that there is a corner lens barrel effect distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom in this is due to the parallax effect the lens maker knows this and engineered it that way to minimize th parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
but about the best thing is i ve played on ithave you ever noticed when watching a movie the screen will freeze but the movie is still playing and eventualy the movie kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
volume level is ok	1
of the price performance looked just right	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
cameras are a big plus on this camera	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
is made of plastic	0
as always super quick shipping by the way and it arrived in great shape	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
has nt been for me at all	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
the monitors were both black	0
thought the software was decent enough it nt complicated to learn at all	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
it also has a view through our two story house	1
the mount is adjustable and it is easy to tie up on the handlebars	1
it which is for these cameras	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
another point of note the battery life is excellent	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
i keep trying and it keeps telling me no disc	0
fragile	0
they are not wowable good	0
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
at the very least a nice sturdy and light carrying case would be nice	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
the zen xtra sounds very good and works well with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
beats ipod is battery life hours excellent	1
but are you ve used a slr mm camera the controls intuitive very if	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
i it love my new nomad its great	1
this router is the best i have used to date	1
for on shuffle totally	1
in that model the hard drive just died the day before my class	0
these speakers just are incredibly amazing	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to backing router is a nice various when my up from the feature computers	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
other than that great	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in the quality	1
overall an excellent phone	1
i have this monitor for a while now and i m very happy with it	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me you at this price and can t go wrong	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
megapixels is enough for anybody very good and the photo quality is awesome	1
sound quality is good	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
even the even slightest of the shakes totally is enough to distorts your image	0
the main problem with the xtra jukebox zen nomad gb is the software	0
it working back came and i was momentarily did be true in my case the rumors i d heard about acer tech support glad nt that out to turn	1
in i d is a decent for the money	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
using it i play any dvd	0
it it looks like it is looks very cool and seems quite small to me heavy but it is very light and very light	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
good do and	1
finally making a cd from the computer can be a bit of a pain because the tracks are listed individually and are separated by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
works super easy	1
i have over head files in my playlist at the moment and the random i think this one does a nice job a dozen of these mixing it up	0
an excellent value is this	1
and is mp on to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with another great misfortune s the list software on goes hard	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
with looks great and is loaded it features	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
i just purchased  this phone and i think have ever this is the coolest phone i have to say i ever had	1
i was be able to hear surprised how good the sound was and to music i especially like to use it when i liked it i will be sure am listening to audio books	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
volume level is	1
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
damaged the player not not read any of my region one dvds even though they were would unfortunately any way in	0
this is have best phone i the seen	1
the things that are really cool like the radio	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the investment	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
i it find too bright	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the problem with this is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
lots of sound options an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
so far the router has worked well	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
is nice	1
very simple to use	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the pictures are a learning curve to it and their is fabulous have nt even gotten to are tons of features i there	1
the function lever the one which a bit off switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
but this camera is great	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
the big me backlight makes eye wants to see so the backlight things easy to see and picture is what the writing is big enough for people to see	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i got both	1
i ve been i ve noticed that the s bothered i ve noticed that the s seem to be bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better i have been playing this game for a while now i have noticed thatthe s see by blown out highlights on the s and have been i ve noticed that the s seem to be bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly bette the g seems to do only slightly better	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the fm radio is cool	1
the face scan option can be turned off easily by pressing the power button on the remote control which is one of the most convenient remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
i negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
great camera	1
also included is a free book but that is not a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
in fact i would say not bright enough	0
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
what day a junk	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
it does nt look too bad but after spending this kind of cash you would expect something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
left the remote works not work right the remote will but then it does in trouble not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
please consider half much of equipment piece superior before plopping grand this a down for an ipod	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
it with a remote control	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
no problems dropped signals unlike it replaced which only months	1
is a great camera for you	1
nt feel to my favorite music station it put i next to me when i went to bed just to listen got this phone and the handset itself i the first night weight anything its too light and does so comfy with it	1
it has not only even it have difficulty playing jpegs does trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
the creative labs xtra has all the has and you get if from amazon your only going to pay	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
easy enough but it did not work	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots the kids with sparklers	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
first the zen lets you more than one	1
very good value for the money	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
usb transfers transfer is insanely fast	0
after we we tried to contact apex but never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is busy do not answer their web customer support	0
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
games it has cool screen why not it	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the one i am using is very easy to use and set up	1
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
that the fastest speed anything has connected to has been around mb s even when in same room	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
stopped workin video output	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants to use it for music and external speakers	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
but days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
i have this connected to my late wifes pro and it works	1
it easy for beginners to use but has features that so is an excellent camera to	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find the nikon to be a great product that i can recommend	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
now that i have all my data on it there has not been any more problems	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
about coverage complete get everywhere in my house the my basement sq ft rrb and it is located in lrb corner of i	1
the design is sleek and the color is good and the screen has good resolution	1
setup on for my application i found cd setup software software the enclosed the to be useless	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and boring so if you prefer to take your photographs from a distance	0
this model router has now failed me twice of time mentioned	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
is really good the sound quality	1
the problem is large	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
portable	1
the instructions that come with it do to explain how things make nt simple	0
the explorer program did was down a couple times while i or renaming titles genres up and but i did nt have to reboot the computer changing anything just open shut explorer again	0
battery life is ok	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
within issues with my menu dial about once a month a year there are problems with my menu dial about once knob	0
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
the changing of the guardyou can help to tell with a quick glance	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
for two months ve pleased had the camera i and i m even more now with it	1
i love fact the i can my it in shirt or pants carry pocket and forget about it	0
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will love	1
excellent phone the phone looks much u see what better than in the pictures	1
again the sounds of the tv and the sound from where they should the front of the tv	1
overall i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a backpack	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the test of time	0
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear close you can the subject and pictures with the lens unbelievably the take	1
the sound is good but if u put it too loud depends on how loud the sound is	0
the g had problems focusing on the subject and did not take the picture when the shutter was released but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
i ve already creative tech support it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
live blu ray player a wd my tv good normally lean back smile and light a smoke up after and box firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
key instead	0
the registration process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the government is sub par	0
easy pair to	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
such as mp s is very compact and this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
for the price is nothing better there	1
the menu options appear one a time the whole screen has to down by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
it is small unlike my canon slr so fits my pocket it in easily	1
this camera is worth every penny it and i highly recommend it	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
luckily for me i already owned a g and had one of the highest quality external flashes that money could buy now the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and use it	1
on the positive side of sound the the player is everything once you have pretty good configured	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement a hard drive based player for	1
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
the color so beautiful is red and is so attractive	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to any of divx rips	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but turns it only contained a of instructions and offered by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
i ve had this my decision months now pleased i am and with for	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
no it was only with so and also decent free shipping overall it is a tax player	1
when i put it to use for my work it is very quiet in the office and the speaker has worked as expected even out of doors	1
it did also seem to have strong a for electronics smell new some time	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
was when said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells is	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
for the price it is a well investment	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with this and i love the colors and the way they change across the panel when i move from the center to the edges	1
not only is not only the price is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i the price have	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
the on radio button on the front of the router didnt work because the gui one wasnt working so anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the button	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
insulated gauge m also running thick this i speaker wire through the stands in wall rated accommodate wire perfectly even and the groove in the bottom of the base	0
the canon computer software used download sort upload and your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
the quality is superb	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that do nt rrb	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
the bundled and fileviewer software remote capture for photo capture is mind blowing	1
they could be more comfortable but no one is going to complain in the sound department	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was software the	0
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised system this player tags a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive based nx that categorizes on navigational i d boasts and excellent sound	1
use them as much as i thought i  the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them i would like them but now i do and i can justify th and even at the beginning did not think  would justify the huge difference in price	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
i wanted the product to but just did nt	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
did i not managed to to work creative nomad explorer make	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of the phone but it is a great phone mine has worked without any problems and is out of this world	1
great quality picture and features	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
i highly recommend a nokia	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
this thing is great i use like to use it to pick my books and put them up tough stains on my countertop and also up stains on my countertop and also really cool to listen to my old track record really cool to listen to my old track records	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
the scroll bar the internet is a bit of a pain	0
i love the quality of the pictures	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
awesome sound sound system	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
the software is very easy to use and within minutes opening was my box i of out and to of about any one listening my cds	1
well flash photos are not great and there was still a lot of noise	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
some people problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me is if use the case covers the switch	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
otherwise a monitor decent very for its price	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south america last year and it works almost perfectly	1
it does a lense cap have but nt wo it let real good take pics with it on which is you	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
i have had no problems no luck with the phone	1
and i the phone had the positive features were good sound quality while fm excellent an phone and earpiece	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
when i got it simply i discovered that home for messages sending via either text or email the menu options were nt there	0
canon is g does it consistently	0
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
i am remain extremely pleased with this router	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures the window	0
os the firmware and or quite simply the that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i best tech support have ever experienced	1
this is an excellent value	1
many of our disney movies do nt you play on this dvd player	0
the able replacable battery is great since runs out once it replace it with eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
anything this phone does it well	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you the drive open	1
finding a particular song or album on the internet is fast and easy	1
much faster than my previous acer netbook with single processor	1
the sound quality is not good either and the driver has trouble keeping up with other sound blaster products which is annoying	0
was support tech very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
the included eax support is useful at times can be difficult to find an eax that will adjust the equalizer for you which can b especially when you listen to match the music you are listening to to a variety of genres as it it is useful at times can be difficult to find an eax that will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle especially when you listen to match the music you are listening to to a variety of genres as it time times will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
it is a great travel companion for you if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
with similarly small speakers	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
the system its focusing system is also very flexible	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1

shipping very fast and they are up easy to set was	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
with box is that reboots several an hour if more frequently	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
you can thank the bad guys for that or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
good looks	1
the fm radio is cool	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
support is technical support rude and unhelpful	0
the sound quality is very good	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra monitor slim	1
either way can go t go wrong with this price	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
do overall i like it	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
is material on the cheap side	0
i ve department sent to their customer service e mails requesting an ra with no response	0
good looks	1
excellent is picture quality	1
the monitors were both good	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i fell in love with this camera has a lot it combines of features ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
no fm or voice recording these have been nice extras	0
i am able to carry other phones close concealed in to my body where it are not so easily places	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
i like the performance in every regard i would buy another one solely upon of it	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts with your friends	1
what i do nt like lost is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
and the finish is more mirror than silver update i like it	1
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
it has many great features ones and very few bad ones	1
video output stopped workin	0
the is keyboard also very nice some it although quite comfortable does take and getting used to	1

considering the price and specs this card for a portable media might be the best buy out the best deal there for a large memory mp player	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
it does tend to run quite hot and should be used with lots of fans for air circulation	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
you of course have options good customization some with the as unit well	1
user replaceable battery	1

images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
only one thing about the speakerphone you can only activate the speaker phone once the person you are calling is on the phone not while it is on	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
this machine a will your whole idea of what change laptop should be	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
its size which might not seem to matter except if you are going to use it while driving or keep it in your pocket	0
do nt know other people are saying the software is awesome	1
when the sound quality is good but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
the video above problems came from my video card	0

i ve had no problems at all have so far have and i m very happy	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
also very light and portable	1
very convenient to scroll etc in menu	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
the woofer is much larger	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds being able to play	1

for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
and really this is the best one could have	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1

pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0

and of a amazon com has it for such a wrong great price how can you go wrong	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
all i can say is is awesome that this is an excellent devise	1
for the price is have these things sound great and bottom line tons of good bass	1
even the bass here is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
due i the to of was very unimpressed and having just dropped the bones for this router lack support for whs upnp guestnetwork	0
when comes matrox g dual dvi more the out i ll consider purchasing one these super displays of card	1
trumps instincts are razor sharp even in	1

sound is crystal clear and the bass as well very deep is	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
were did nt kids and our work the first one we installed devastated to say the least	0
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it i was in my room and connected to the internet to the network but no internet connection	0
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
the use with hot shoe flash attachment allowed and the camera me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1

this little speaker has dynamite sound	1

the the screen is color as are a plus polyphonic ringtones	1
i really like the quality of the pictures	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1

the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
mr trump is trash	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
to me it seems like this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
the quick sync is nt any good at all it either needs to be configured properly or just is not very useful	0

i love it and have taken high quality pictures every time	1
i think this is the best i have used to date	1

the toggle is that button used does not work well scroll is poorly designed and to	0

its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised see small it when unwrapped	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1

the unit wonderful it trigger the shutter it can used to zoom and review pictures	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1

i just hooked it up and seemed be going fine	1

i bought this slick new laptop and i am very happy with it	1

i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
with have not use i is the features yet but the camera all easy to played once you get used to it	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1

door broke after a month	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
the in is i d tag program editing a strong point as well	1
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1

camera great	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
for a specific location i its think still a great phone	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
to can recommend this phone i anyone anytime	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0

after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
i m delighted	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and available	0
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy it to them i was able to return the product at the only place i could find to return no loss on my part	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
i have seen the dvd and have been wanting to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and hassle of getting the time to do it is over	0
in addition it samsung gear vr comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
also it was very easy to set up a route as long as the route was exactly the same as my route on netgear	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
screen was good easy to read	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
i was on the phone and i could nt connect to the internet	0
for instance i for me i have several back ups of my dvd movies i have multiple backups of mydvd moviesusing dvdr and my dvds using dvd r and r and it plays the dvud made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
one beef is fact that some of the things the scroll it does nt work seem to work as well as i d like	0
best i d like to the price i d ever seen at the was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
i give it a rating a couple of stars for looks	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
i love this player	1
finally i reiterate my decision to shut down my account for t mobile as a carrier	0
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly interrupted	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
does it should and the sound fine to me	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
highly recommended this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
the woofer much larger	1
and with usb headphones adding music to your player is incredibly easy	1
was sold seeing and after the sound of the i tour pop speaker i hearing	1
it you different modify your sound with different presets you is pretty good which can get can variations with with eax on	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
easy plus is valet configure to and was set up in about minutes	1
unfortunately it can t play that way	0
i think the real reason that made the change is that it now makes sense to use gpu hardware acceleration	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for and the fact that it has great very high quality clean images i also like the quality of the images	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
having music so to much access where ever you go is terrific	1
the larger lens of the g gives you a better view better picture quality in low light and the times much optical can be used to bring zooms gets you just that much closer	1
deficiencies with zennx easily overcome rd party and	0
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
this has taught me that you should always have room for new technologies as they evolve	0
the excels as a cell phone thank you	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
pros so off i is what i got and this went to get a faster router and this went one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
difficult navigation i wo nt say difficult necessarily but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
the is device itself is pretty solid	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
is a great feature the sound finally the price cheaper is goodthe fact of the battery i is good the fact that it is cheaper than th is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper is goodthe fact that it is cheaper than the gb ipod is excellentthe fact of the battery life i is good the fact that it is cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1

usb transfer is insanely fast	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
recommend getting the superdrive and wifi modules	1

its way far more difficult to expensive than the new ipod and it has no way to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the old ipod not to mention it does nt system sinc with contac select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as use than the new ipod it has no way to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the old ipod not to mention it does nt system the new ipod not to mention  it does nt system  sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
the problems came from my video card	0
the possibilities mode auto manual and the very helpful scene snow which beach optimized situational settings portrait landscape like offers with sunset etc are endless	1
although the nokia is to it short on the features department little is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing a what was primarily meant it do to be a wireless telephone	1
i got it great great sound understand that the volume the towers own volume different things should be placed at the right measures get the better sound so i do nt complain the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1

the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it is not a wrist strap but more of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1

for the most part this is a dvd	0
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the book is hard to read in daylight but at night it is too	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0

this is extemely lame	0
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0

amazon was my husband wonderful about picking picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
the volume control wheel is finicky it is hard to press most of the time but there is a method for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so difficult to press that they just return the device	0
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just a bit slow and does nt load on some computers	0
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0

i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
customer service and technical overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	1

it will download and play all cd audio disc	1
the battery is nice	1
the main functions of the app will only be available through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would allow you to configure the app to be used on a different device	0

you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
