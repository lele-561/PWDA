after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
i have not had time to really work on this one as time is stretched to the limit but audio aspects of it are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show a lot of different names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to norma  the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must nt show a lot of different names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to norma the complete filenames of m cycle through every zoom setting before  getting the zoom settings of the remote control are only so so it does nt show a lot of different names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to norma the complete filenames of m th back to normal size	0

m not willing to accept construction on something paid over dollars	0
battery is alot better than of the phones out there	0
excellent phone the phone is a lot better than what u see in the pictures	1
surprisingly everything seems to	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
about a month ago bought my canon g i and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
very easy to set up	1
protective case completely useless as is is since it obscures doesnt have a display window	0
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
this led monitor is fantastic	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
its ability to act as a back up for my music collection is amazing	1
the acer monitor it to be placed has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area in a small area lrb from very small a heighth perspective rrb that to a many screens will not fit in	0
for can not be created folders the audio files	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
its far heavier and much larger might not seem to matter except if use it while or keep it in your pocket	0
great color scheme for the picture and just the right size for my desk	1
when you this phone in your pocket it is and oh so	1
to can recommend this phone i anyone anytime	1
navigation system the zen music system the mp id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
the backlight the phone goes off way too quickly there is no way to change this	0
please note that the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to help you find your files thanks	1
simple click easy and back volume buttons display are very buttons to read access and use	1
highly recommend getting the bluetooth headset and the wifi bluetooth headphones	1
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd media disc other would play but able to play that i had burned that i could nt get work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that had	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
megapixels enough for anybody the photo is awesome	1
works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of the screen make the type of display either list or tabbed	1
the cover that came with well it did not seem to nt fit very well	0
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
no one mm a x sells mm sized lrb what or ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
this is listen and you want to listen to music a nice feature i e it is early in the morning music then this is and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
i was surprised how good the sound was i especially like it when am listening to audio books	1
i think the lens cap design is flawed	0
the design and construction of the nikon optics are outstanding as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
i think the real reason made the changes is now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a types of text mixture of  various colors and de focused text	0
the macro mode is exceptional as the details are very clear and you can see the details with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
you ca go wrong with these if what are looking for is a good sound in small package	1
good a overall buy for the price	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
i think this is another excellent creative product	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy general i am not sure another because of the price and one solely upon the the look and feel of the phone in every regard i would buy one but i am not sure another because of the price and one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of i apparent fact that the phone is not waterproof despite the indestructibility of it	1
the sound shutting great noise the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and is out external and	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you forget entirely about workspace issues	1
these monitors the best deals are great for the price	1
this a lot of most fun is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
my alarm goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change thi the backlight on the way phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
i no had it a couple weeks it got find a state after it could no into the was never matter how often i device my pc reset the rebooted reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support device where help at all	0
phone is one of the few phones that an fm tuner built in	1
not it plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
other things that i headphone miss headphone jack instead of a are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
so yes as with all is free software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
first of all my calls were loud and clear and with sprint	1
my only complaint is that when i am not here it sometimes disconnects from the internet and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the memory is gone	0
seems to read most dvds fine be reading and reads quietly	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
all here the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
it looks good sounds good and does everything it claims	1
amazing this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
at first i dealt with this was still really fast	1
another point of note the battery life incredible is	1
folders can not be created audio files for the audio files	0
featured sharp image	1
getting good value	1
the a good set of zen xtra sounds great with by the good headphone and well recored mp s	1
have i had no problems with the phone	1
the scene mode focus works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be  in in the scene mode but need a regular setting	0
the ability to shuffle modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is not available on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
no problems with dropped signals worked for a few unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
is awesome this thing is trash	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the to fill of the screen and the still looked normal	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all up	1
windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer a folder for the nomad	1
trash is this thing	0
your health is fine	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
i still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound is control panel every time i switch between music and videos games the sound is much more acceptable	0
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
the g tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode makes it very easy the novice to use	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
also you ipod store data on it which is a plus just all you people who want to say buy can for to buy you have an ipod do nt bother this a much better is an	1
i it thought discs checking but then the apex started just the player the was to find that i is actually ruining my media	0
is just set it up manually i which very easy	1
for the price it is a very nice player	1
when the player was not a problem working it was great but	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job	1
unfortunately after loading the app all i get now is a message saying its either not connected or busy	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access the internet very well at all	0
however i do not like to wear it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the strap is loose and can slip off	0
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly audible superior	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
the canon computer to used software and sort upload and pictures very digital manage on the computer is your nice download very easy to use	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
when the was working it was great	0
this is cool	1
the canon computer software used to download and upload and manage your digital pictures on the canon website is very easy to use and very fast to use	1
just an average user getting a lot of value in this product	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is a message saying im either not connected or busy	0
headphones i suck would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i paid construction willing to accept shoddy not on something i m over dollars for	0
they caused the problem ie the software in the box the service tech was unable to believe what the software said was wrong	0

they really good just the reviews	1
it looks great and is	1
i m not a big fan of books by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this one really deserves five stars	1
it worked then a about for week perfectly the problems came	1
it would have been screen cover on the top much nicer if it could see the screen had a window so you could see the screen and if button on the side the button did nt of the phone if it could see the screen had a window so you could see a screen and if button on the side the button did nt cover up the ac jac cover up the ac jack	0
these have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the volume up	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the get hear side speakers like go with my new i did with my old front speakers	1
however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible with the adapter unfortunately it does not provide mac support for the adapter itself	0
i ve so happy had this for months now and i am pleased with the results my decision	1
this is especially useful if you have a lot of children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them while they are playing	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
this is the best i ve ever seen and dvd player i ve purchased	1
for a small portable unit this allows you want to listen listen to music on the go to listen to as well as share ipod those who dont know music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
the netbook with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home starter instaled but other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody seems to care about this	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
failed repeatedly the software	0
and nice compact	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the bottom line is that this is an excellent game enjoy all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
all is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars the range the time	1
the downside is the remote requires a of sight	0
getting access to the device is so easy	1
so is connection to the device easy	1
very easy to set up	1
protective case completely useless as is it display window	0
you wrong with these i dont think you can ca see anything nt go wrong with these looking if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
appearance is okayed	1
music is based on id and be older downloaded music files with information	0
the cover came that came with it did nt fit very well	0
it looks sleek and stylish and does	1
despite its being slightly larger than i expected i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped it	1
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
that i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
money router is awesom but you will only support xbox we have the you can to get and were very nice to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when you contaced support more than and tried thre best just get it working right but to no avail bottom fine and very secure if it never have a computer a laptop line i will be they this router is well worth and this	1
surprisingly everything seems to work be going well	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you for sale at money do nt purchase it	0
price value comparing data storage with price	1
they and pretty comfortable stay in place re deliver a decent audio quality	1
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
storage capacity	1
only owned it about two weeks so i will be expect we re looking will be at getting a another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
the player on every once in a while prompting a reset	0
the zen xtra sounds with good headphone well recored s	1
i does it cds ripping for which it use a pretty good job of	1
the sound the battery life is excellent that the battery is replacable excellent and finally the price is excellent	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to version of the the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is version of dd wrt i found out about the latest firmware atdd wrt is website and http www ddwrt com i also downloaded the latest versions from i website and http www ddwrt com i also downloaded the latest version from it resolved all my problems	1
i started accessing and transfering files to my computer and uploaded it to github	0
highly getting recommend the superdrive modules the wifi bluetooth and	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for time on this device much battery life but not great a hard drive based player	0
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
the remote is a little hard to find	0
i do i getting see myself having any issues know do the coming year in however will this or two nt will to that with this customer it if be taken care of for free and quick with helpful item courteous product service reps the service of amazon in for i and with it knew it would be was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i me	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
i just it hooked up and going fine seemed to be everything	1
are all very easy to use	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as it could be	1
taken in are dull and rarely hazy if tend to take photographs from a distance	0
otherwise known for its price	1
doesnt work i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
fm the radio is cool	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
this mentioned router has span failed me twice now the short in of time model	0
like other reviewers installation the was hell	0
the organization is based on id and this can be a problem for organizations with outdated or incorrect id information	0
similar to the tags navigation system the zen xtra uses music files to id tags that are embedded in the mp help you find files to organize your songs	0
i and had this for pleased with my decision now ve i am months	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
my only significant complaint the key is sound quality	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to the dvd see a total of for a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player this dvd time to get rid of it to do it i dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player this dvd time to get rid of it to do  it is job	0
i kept apex called support number numerous times but it just is ringing	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers indicated	0
they will not allow me to talk to my family and the phone line is constantly busy	0
despite most reviewers giving a flaw to experienced for music quality i the zen kudos using eax	0
to use great price for all the features	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
i did a the notmad software a week ago and vast that buy found improvement	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera for the price out there today at this price point	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the great features that a great game has and if you get if from us your only going to pay for this great player	1
