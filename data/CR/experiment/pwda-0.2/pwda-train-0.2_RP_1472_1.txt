in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
while there are flaws with the car the xtra gets a lot of praise because of its affordability	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
the manual setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for some things	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
convenience because it can be used through the usb port	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is a pain	0
no dropouts in my house and i have full strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very well equipped in the setup and security aspects	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
working for a living with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
no one sells a power adapter for lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
its great	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
my call to the direct link support line was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they walked me through the process without a problem i have never had a problem before	1
it s a great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
possibly the biggest advantage this device has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by simply removing the battery and putting in the new battery	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online gaming services and pc compatibility are the key features	1
meanwhile the instructions for installing the app indicated i should load a pdf of instructions but it turns out it only shows a link to a pdf and nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the quality is excellent	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
the daylight pictures are excellent and the indoor shots are very good considering that the room is no more than about feet square	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
other than that this thing is awesome	1
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
size is smaller than the ipod	0
it is the most bang for the buck you can get	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices connected to my laptops desktop and i was able to get online in minutes	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
i bought this router and expected to get a good deal on it i paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt about it this kills it for me	0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
i have been playing minecraft on it and it has been a great experience and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
bright vivid clean lines with great viewing angle and best of all great price	1
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
i was able to take great photos of the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
please consider this piece of equipment before plopping down your money for an ipod	1
the world itself has all sorts of problems	0
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
software definitely sucks hangs up on me about half the time but i love it	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i hate amazon but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
this really is a great phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great battery life and its cheap	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or for other applications	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she wanted to have a small computer that would keep her from having to work from home with her	1
i am very pleased with it	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with the same battery	1
the netgear router was easy to set up and has worked well for the most part in the short to few months i have had it	1
i have to say that the interface on this site is very easy to use if you have a bit of a learning curve	1
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
player is great and looks great if you can get the dvd version	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no difference in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as well	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
the only things i have to complain about is that the book is hard to read in daylight but i guess everyone elses is too	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
they were both good	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i tried to send them a mailing and they come back saying undeliverable	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software to make it work in the first place	0
creative are the sound people and i can t see why eax would introduce static	0
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
honestly i love this player	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house whether it be large or small buisiness	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
the power button is on and has an led light on it and a little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about seconds for a cd on my pentium pc with x drive	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
the case is too big and it took me more than a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower power consumption and i found both	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
im happy everything seems to work well	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install a new firmware but this still doesnt work	0
it is not perfect but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a professional	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have a headphone jack	1
after several years of being in the hands of at t customer service i am very happy with the results and i look forward to the day when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
vocalist has dynamite sound	1
in addition it comes with the following	1
fragile	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
i was very impressed by this very inexpensive battery it worked great for the first three hours and then it died	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
mp x optical zoom allows you to take beautiful photos with detail that you cant get with all of the above other cameras you have to understand and use a lot of features and add on features that comes with the camera and last but by	1
on the other hand indoor shots with a flash are not nearly as good as mm	0
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
the build quality feels very solid and it does not shake or vibrate while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be better off with a gb instead of a hard drive one on which i have no control or at worst invested in companies never to buy products from again	0
the ihome is stereo and the imac is clearly superior	1
i bought this and it worked like a charm great picture quality great colors and very light weight	1
first the zen lets you sync with your friends	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i like that at night you can change the brightness for at night rrb	1
i give my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier why i dont know	0
the image processing software that does not provide you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the software	0
i am bored with the silver look	0
it does tend to run a little slow and should be given lots of room to breathe	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with the mms software which you will enjoy	1
i ve tried them all out and they all play great	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
it is very small and seems quite small to me and very small	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
this has happened before and occasionally if we are lucky it will work when it did not work the one time before	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the user interface and settings are easy use	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
no games it has a lot of power so why not use it	0
this thing is awesome	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of the phone but it is a great phone mine worked great and was very fast out of the box	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and thanks for reading my review	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i am and one that is capable of handling a lot of music and could easily be upgraded to meet those	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than the tv remote	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
highly recommend this product at this price point	1
this is the second apex product i have bought from this brand and they continue to impress for the price	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
its cheap and it comes with a remote control	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
the design and construction are very similar as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
now there is only one thing i have to say about this camera and that is that i only use with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
the replacement one had a few problems too the little switch on the bottom was not working properly making it very difficult to select among city forecasts in my area	0
this router is the best i have used to date	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
the software which is used to communicate with player is not good at all	0
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is not loud enough at	0
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
picture quality is excellent	1
and so far there is no complaints about that	1
it is simple enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to enjoy	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
the video above came from my video card	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
best electronic i have ever bought since i was born	1
my first impression was positive	1
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this camera was affordable very easy to use and produced some spectacular images	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very sturdy feel	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of music you want to play or you can set the interface as modern or classical	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
dr johns sound system	1
do nt buy this monitor	0
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
if you want a quality product that will arrive on time buy this one	1
the problems that come with it are nt that bad	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
navigating through the menus is super easy even if you have owned the game before	1
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving out the support stars	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is so sturdy and sturdy	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i find the lack of entertaining apps and games on this phone quite disturbing	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
great quality of life and features	1
the top that covered the battery compartment kept poping off without any warning and there was a bit of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the second set is working just fine	1
if you use the gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and hit that dreaded apply button yes or no enjoy	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
i have had no problems with it	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it is not a wrist strap but more of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera i have under	1
megapixels is a great camera for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
when you put this thing in your pocket you forget it is there it is so small and oh so light	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
the stock is on the cheap side	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
i thought the software was decent and easy to use it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
so so off i went to get a faster router and this one did what i bought it for admirably	1
because it can make a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
one downside though is that it does not work as a flashlight when battery is low	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
it is crystal clear	1
screen was good easy to read	1
i highly recommend it	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
you have to press the buttons to scroll and frequently i end up pressing the wrong button when i want to scroll	0
but i ve already spoken to creative tech support about it and gotten a promise that they will fix it for me if necessary	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
with all its complicated features the menus are easily navigated and the ease of use of the features is great	1
these have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the volume up	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player would not move	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
i highly recommend it	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
setup software for my application i found the software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
screen was good easy to read	1
it is worth it	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
you can also download playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from your player to your players	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i have been using this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
for now i could not ask for more	1
do nt ndodh	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
i use it for the following which it does a good job of	1
it is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was able to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
portable	1
usb means usb	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus	1
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched	0
overall i like the unit	1
i am still in awe of this camera canon and how it puts enormous quality into the g	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
even better with the optional headset you can use to listen to music over the integrated radio	1
i thought this was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account thanks	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it doesnt have those features like bluetooth and gps but there are very few problems with things that you cant do with this phone	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just doesnt work	0
the zooming lever is shaky i would suggest you use it carefully otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
it is easy to use it is just velcro and easy to tie up on the handlebars	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given the quality	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
the changing colors help to tell the time with a quick glance	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
games kind of stink and you ca not download them you have to follow the link on the right to get additional games	0
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
no direct firewire to the camera	0
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
and it works great too	1
the sound is surprising full with a good amount of detail even for such a small unit	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
photographs taken in an indoor setting are usually clear and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
the screen is not backlit	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
no way to contact their customer service	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
volume level is ok	1
photographers will find the cameras auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the whole family	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
i found it easy to use to the interface and can find any song i want etc fast enough	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
this has so many possibilities that you ll always have room for new ideas and technologies as they evolve	0
my only real complaint is sound quality	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
you can download it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
it is not it	0
the company offers a range of metering options as well	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
i have been using this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it works and the picture clarity is unmatched	1
this is a good place to start for music and data storage	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
speed and range speed	1
billy joel was nt a bad guy when he said you get more bang for your buck from a cheep pair of speakers	1
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the work i did	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
my fingers are on the side of the thing instead of on the top which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
but after days the sound worked but the video quit working	0
but if you are looking for a great deal and a great team player get the nomad	1
for the most part this is true	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
i just purchased this phone and i have to say this is the coolest phone i have ever had	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt have any problems with it	1
this is the best phone i have seen	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
we got this on time and it was brand new so it had good performance as can be expected for the machine but keep in mind i am the owner of this machine so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
the appearance is similar	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from the cloud	1
very good value for the money	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt heard them before	1
the sound is excellent the screen is good the battery life is excellentthe fact that the battery is replacable is great and finally the price is better than the competition is excellent	1
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
i can t say it one way or another only because when it does work it is amazing	0
valet is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
the signs were nt so clear	0
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
there are a lot of features in this little yet powerful camera	1
great minds	1
i was upset because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
as a portable player it should work	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts with your friends	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout in the market and has all this and more	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name a few how i view it	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
the price is average but that is nt a big deal because that s not what you are buying it for	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
downloading files with missing or incorrect id information downloading files is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded files here are some examples	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
my only complaint is that the list is not long enough	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high end travel size laptop i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior price and quality of the build	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
it will download and play all cd audio disc	1
i have it for a week now and this is the first time it has exceeded my expectations	1
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt allow and nobody mention this	1
the app is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
i also really liked the fact that you can save and play the playlist you made on the player not just the computer	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
overall i like the system features and performance	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
i have not had to deal with any of the usual problems with digital cameras so i am very pleased	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
the storage capacity is great	1
to my amazement even that process was error free	0
i spent hours on the net with their help and support lrb you can and do nt have to and got at least my imac and macbook for free online	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
halfway through the router upgrade progress bar the infamous router is not found it has been replaced most of the router is interface	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
i love this player	1
pros competitive cost win home premium hdmi port lrb i could watch the amazon instant videos on my hdtv and its delivering great	1
nice and easy to use and excellent when it comes to the games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me when i bought it and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular basis as well	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
however shareport on this new router worked fine	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
what is added in functionality is not the same as in build quality as the metal plate is prone to popping off	0
the screen size and ring tones are unlimited	1
i ve gotten back to the point i ve tried to be so many times over the past month of dealing with my emotions and feelings i	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the slimmest of viewing angles are excellent	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0
my blu ray player and my live tv player both normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
no option for caller id pictures or the ability to set ringtones	0
this player is not worth any price and i strongly recommend that you do not purchase it	0
it has storage supposedly it is slow	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
if you are not afraid to try go for it	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
i think this is perfect although i m not watching on tv thanks	1
i think this is without a doubt the finest looking portable dvd player that i ve seen	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the press of a button and it has an on and off manual focus mode that can be really helpful if you are trying to focus in a scene that is tough to automatically	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
i do not care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
great phone	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
sound pretty good though i can t really compare it to the others	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple of months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
i did the same thing with the same software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
luckily for me i already owned a g and had one of the highest quality external flashes that money could buy now the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and use it	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
this is a very good looking phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
they caused the problem ie the software was wrong and the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
it has never worked	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
i am giving this player cautious recommendation	1
i lived in a small college apartment the e s and f s were nice but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the app is easy to use	1
the digital zoom takes twice as long as the analog zoom does	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
the scroll wheel is a huge improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo it is way better than the ipods	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
the bottom line is for the most part these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
you ca nt go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package	1
thanks for the excellent photos	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
additional features	1
i m not always impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
i found it very useful for transferring files from one computer to another computer	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
so if you re game for a little fiddling you will be very pleased with this day in your life	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am hooked	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
well it had good power but not much at all	1
i like the fact i can carry it in my hand or in my pocket and forget about it	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to reach out to them but we never got in touch with them the customer support number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
its fine	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my computer	1
only if we could find them	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of the customer service and their willingness to work with you	0
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
i tried to call them for a week and a day and always got a busy signal	0
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen better than the nx is able to	1
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the screen is very bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a good coffee machine should be	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
i have also tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was a bit difficult to use in the car which is somewhat of a problem	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
this wonderful product was created	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
the lessons of history are razor sharp even in macro	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
i have been playing around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at what i have there too	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the instructions on the hard drive	1
very simple to use	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets worse and worse	1
my wife is very pleased due to its widescreen	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
x zoom is used	1
it is like when it randomly comes back from the dead and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often and its really annoying	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
i love it but unforutnately i am returning it	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
otherwise this player is awesome	1
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i picked it up	0
is nice	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads them well	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone from beginners to advanced photographers plus advanced functions for those who are more knowledgeable about photography	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed all the way down into the bottom of the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
great quality picture and features	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the interface was atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
i could tell this was a cheap monitor as soon as i set it up	0
however for a budget i would say this model is an excellent choice	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits easily into my purse or purse stand	1
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
the team is top notch	1
i was looking for both and this product delivers both	1
the problem is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the uk it applies to all countries the problem is products	0
but if you ve used a mm or mm the controls are very intuitive	1
this camera has a built in camera to stitch pictures together and to find out more just log on to canon is website	0
the sound is pretty good but if u put it too loud or too low the sound might crack	0
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
this is an excellent value	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
i am bored with the silver lining	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
also the sound quality while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to follow its a shame	0
there is an alarm i still have nt used it yet but it should be good	1
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
due to the lack of support for the project and having just dropped the project from my mind i was very unimpressed	0
it is easy enough to leave it open to see what song you are currently listening to	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the interface used could be better designed	0
when i opened it up i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via email or either text or email simply were nt there	0
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
no headphone jackno headset jack	0
the main music player with the nomad jukebox zen is the music player gb is the software	0
neither message was answered	0
having spent considerable time with the video gear i have	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
i have no doubt that my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an easy to use phone and camera	1
it works great	1
very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire placement	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
it may	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
cons i think the satellites will be ugly	0
sound settings can be adjusted for this game	1
good range speed	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
please note that the zen xtra uses i d tags that are embedded in the mp files to help you find your files thanks	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
easy to hook up	1
only one thing to note about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerbo feature once when you are on the other end of the phone not while it is ringing	0
i got two of these players for christmas gifts and both were great	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
in a world where others say not bright enough	0
the world is small	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
having usb ports allows for very fast transfers	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my phone up to the standard vga port a few days ago and the picture is fine	1
seriously i love it	1
the sound is crystal clear sound with excellent clarity the audio engineer has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr has done an excellent job	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that you do not automatically play one after another in the same game	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
good luck life	1
for a price that is still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this gb monster and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
value of data storage with price	1
in any case it is by artist so it is ok but i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
there was occasionally a new issue	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
the auto focus performs well but i would recommend having the optional scene modes they are very useful and correspond to the situations in which i would most likely seek to use the camera	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
the memory is staggering	1
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
i was looking into buying a laptop that had more than a couple of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it control the shutter it can also be used to zoom and pan around the room	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
i m not one who uses a lot of web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer works	0
the headphones are nt the best but you can never expect much out of a pair of headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make connecting to your router wirelessly a snap it is only a free version you have to download and install from the internet and then pay an additional to some unknown company to	1
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
however i do nt want to post it here because the clip is nt secure and the case is still open	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
i love the bass this thing gets i have a stereo system in my car that should tell you enough if i am happy with the bass level	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great experience for me	1
this is a great camera to have	1
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
this router is awesom but it will only support one type of network and you can never have more than to have a single type the others are either very moderate or strict when i contaced with them they were very nice and tried	0
feel like the plastic is very thin and looks like it would break very easily and it definately would nt survive a drop	0
overall i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a great point and shoot camera in the medium price range at a reasonable price thank you	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1
rrb today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home i cant due to heavy snow	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
i have viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i have ever seen	0
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the test of time	0
i m very pleased with my zx so here is the link	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
other things that i miss are bluetooth activated dialing and internet access	0
i did it the right away and have gotten it right every time	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
i recently purchased this book and am extremely pleased with the purchase	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
my facebook pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as good as when i view them on my computer	0
overall i am very happy with this product and will be using it again	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as it could be	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a simple but very problematic problem of a screen missing from the monitor	0
it will only work if you are side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
the picturers are	1
it would have been a lot nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the screen did not cover up the screen	0
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
conclusion i was able to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i received them	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones but it has to start somewhere	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
my only complaint about it is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do not know if it was a bug or if it is part of the software	0
other than that this thing is great	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the nikon coolpix is one of the best cameras to use high quality and compact in size	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
overall i would reccomend these to anyone who is looking for a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
i was willing to go with the larger size but the durability was not great	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
user replaceable battery	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever seen	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
it wo nt play all the time	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
the stock is a good buy for the price	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
the web cam is also free and i promise i will nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
awesome sound system	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple of times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did not have to reboot the computer or anything it just stopped working	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
sound quality and base is amazing	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
what a day	1
the screen is very well defined and clear and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
awesome camera with lots of features in a tiny package	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
i am going to carry it close to my body in a place where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
for me it is really good	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
overall an excellent phone	1
the weather was terrible	0
the interface used to be better designed	0
this is what you need to have for your first dvd player	1
the software is not good either and the driver has no way of working with other sound cards which is very dumb	0
all the latest acer news and reviews is top notch	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
it is easy to use and it is free	1
very long lasting effect on life	1
i have to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there cost wise	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i can see for hours day in and day out with dark colors the colors and brightness change on the panel when i look from the center to the corner	1
with mediasource being so unreliable i found no use for the app i prefer the nomad explorer software	0
it takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
they fired away and the picture turned out great	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
i have had this book for a while now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
the following is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
i love this monitor	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
had a sound system that was similar to this one and i thought it was good but the new sound is amazing	1
very happy with the quality of the product and the price	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd player	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
this is the best dvd player i have ever purchased	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
it is much better designed than the s	1
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
i would not recommend this product to anyone	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i love it	1
also very light and portable	1
this router is phenomenal	1
and it looks great too	1
it looked just right	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
another point of note the battery life is excellent	1
the hot spot in my flash memory that allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
the cover that came with it did nt look good	0
the acer monitor has an extremely high resolution screen and its design allows the placement in an area of the lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many other monitors will not fit in	1
all in all this is a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features and an interface that is simple to understand and use and a great user experience	1
before asking for this mp player for christmas i researched many different mp players but i finally decided on this one and now that i have it i have used it many times and i am convinced it is the best one out there	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the door	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms can bring you just that much closer	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice to get it to work	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is available	0
when i fired it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with the cd player i only got the sound i wanted	0
well backlit keypad	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
i bought this one because i thought it was the best deal for the money	1
only con i foto there is no camera	0
with this mp player you get a lot more for much less than an ipod	1
we ve tried a few universal dvd players so far all claiming to work as dvd cameras and none worked	0
main dial is not backlit	0
i ve now had the chance to try it out and i m even more pleased with it	1
not plug play relies on id no fm or recording	0
this phone is awesome	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
they say	1
i think this is another excellent creative product	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
easy to read	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
portable	1
the ad did not work for a while and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below average	0
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
within a couple of days there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
its for the money	0
i have been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it claims to be	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
the battery is nice	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
the only problem i have is that when you push in the scroll bar to open it you have to go straight in or it wont open	0
i have panasonic and jvc players they have picture quality on par with my jvcs	1
lrb yeah like you cant use a new very expensive high speed modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the modem and got a new one instead	0
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
people also have complained about the case not being in english but that is not really a problem because it seems to me that the case is in english and offers very good protection	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
no matter the format	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
others may have better screens but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
however once you turn up the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done at work the sound quality is great as well this is a great product for a computer speaker system	1
i was pleasantly surprised that the customer service was able to step me through the setup	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
by cocking the camera to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to go i was able to produce a stopaction that was very similar to what other reviewers experienced	1
the color screen is very good and this free after rebates phone is very fast and commands are very responsive	1
this system is very powerful	1
to get the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you will have to go through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size i have to say that the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so	0
i can do this very easily to many different android phones	1
at least i dealt with this as mbps was still a problem	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the only thing i didnt include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures and videos without worrying about charging	0
fm receiver it is	0
screen brightness is	1
no option for caller i d pictures or individualized ringtones	0
the manual does a fine job filling in any of the gaps that remain	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth adapter	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
it is a bit bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not the same technology that is used in the zx	1
i find all of your arguments to be well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in the list	1
i dont expect it to get this bad again in the same or any other way in the next months because as other people have pointed out it is pretty flimsy	0
i like it although i would prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
although the phone is a little light on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily designed to do to be able to do	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the juke box is nnt the best the music match is nn fast even when accessing it with the right shortcut	0
i have been ripping songs off the internet for the past few years and the ease of use is wonderful	1
one also exhibited extremely slow response times when going to the menu	0
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
it is great to switch on the camera and actually see it working on the big screen	1
the d d dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a d wireless router	1
those who are used to mm cameras will find this very comfortable and friendly to use	1
setup was very easy	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
it worked really well for about a week then the problems came	1
the movie clips taken will probably have some noise in it you can t hear	0
very compact and easy to use just as described with great sound quality	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
i wished that they could make the volumn better	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
these monitors are great for the price	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can change existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
the reaction from the player is ok	1
one good thing it did	1
the back cover can pop off easily but i always have it in the car so i did nt notice it	0
the battery is alot better than most of the other phones out there	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
its focusing system is also known as	1
after using it for about a month i can say unequivocally and unequivocably that this is a great product that delivers a great bang for the buck	1
i was able to take a few pictures of the th of july fire and fireworks and got some great shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
the image quality is poor	0
i ve sent e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
this player is	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
the playlist can be created on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use different modes like shuffle and repeat for your now or later selections or playlists depending on your preferences enjoy	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
the problem is that the fact that anything has connected to it has been around for so long that it s even when in the same room	0
usb means fast data transfers	1
great speakers overall	1
some people have problems with the flip switch but the button that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you are using it as the cover	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
what a day	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
for my money this dvd player was everything i expected it to be an affordable compact format dvd recorder with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
the process is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
the volume	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
many of our disney movies do nt play well on this dvd player	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the price is very good	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database is very limited and the support provided by the software is mediocre at best	0
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
these are perfect for my needs	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
click buttons back buttons volume and power buttons are very easy to read access and use	1
the color red is a common color as are the polyphonic ringtones	0
for me its not a big deal and the support for games and word docs is more than acceptable	0
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and have been using it and so far it has been excellent	1
speakerphone	1
naturally i did quite a bit of research before buying this one and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
nice little phone light compact	1
the storage capacity of	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still would nt work	0
the top of the display is hinged and it can be placed in front of a window or to protect it against the elements afp relaxnews	1

excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
the has the radio function which is utterly unique	1
very easy to set up	1

take a look at the s pii	1
i really love this netbook	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
set up and run with no problems	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
i am using jbl n ii as my sound system which is again a very nice excellent speaker system	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
i think the router has worked well	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
they are surprisingly quick through usb	1
bookmarks for example are available on this page but not on this player	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious users will appreciate so it is a good tool to grow into	1
the only thing i do nt like about this game is that	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
now that i m here however i can t imagine being anywhere else	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
the screen quality is very high the screen is very bright the view is very sharp clear	1
this router does drop out once in a while but not like it did before	1
it works flawlessly for me	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
again the sounds are clear and projected from where they should the front of the stage	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
overall small is great and less expensive than apple is great	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
i got this for christmas and it was awesome	1
it is not	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
i have seen nothing of the problems people have complained and cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a week i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack or scroll wheel will show up with me too in any case	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic which is a disappointment after the stainless steel construction of the s	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
the screen is very bright and the ambient light is bright enough to read at night but not bright enough so it does nt bother you when you stare too long	1
the app is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the problem is much larger	0
about of the problem is that it can t find the battery when i attach it to the charger	0
please feel free to contact their customer service	1
i just got it and i am very happy with it	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
i am ripping my cd collection into a single file this gives an average of around mb of free memory available to me for about cds in the mb that i have available	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1

because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
the text is large and easily read	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
it has a nice color screen	1
bottom line well made camera with easy to use controls and very flexible and powerful features to suit the needs of the usereasy to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i get to the door and everything freezes	0
you of course have some good customization options with your phone as well	1
i followed the easy instructions on the website and once online at the router site there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you want to use it	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers and the sound quality at the same time you can find these speakers for here on amazon	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
great camera great investment	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the new interface for the jpeg mp and mpeg files that can be stored on cd rs dvds	1
great value for the money vs gb ipod for the price	1
what is g does it consistently	0
although the sound quality is good it needs to be more than the average sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just a bit slow and does nt load on some computers	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
the wireless earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1

great sound good sound quality replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers good	1
player is not plug and play so i had to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to get it working and i had a be patient as i was used to having to download the music files and then download and install the music	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
the volume range is great so you can use it if you want	1
chic look and simple design to build the player into a portable device in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the usb port using the usb to usb transfer cable	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best thing i have ever seen and used ever	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
it wo nt one of my movies which are all store bought	0
if you are looking for a small compact camera with a high resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
it is smaller than i thought when i ordered it but as it turns out it is	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
vocals have been added for clarity with the ihome as well	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their phone and telephone number is the same as the one lonely customer service rep i had	0
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no way for me to support this product	1
i highly recommend it	1

surfing the web at night is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages like this	1
the problem is large	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
video output stopped workin	0
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up disk we have nt had to re set the router at all so far since it is delivery so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging signal well worth the purchase price	1
granted i have only used this dvd player once before for a few minutes while setting it up for my son for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with thisdvd player	0
the speaker phone is very functional and i can use it in the car very audible even with the windows down	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
its supposed to work better than those of other models i ve had	0
depressing the scroll button to continue	0
overall a sweet machine	1
the monitor works well with a sharp and clear display	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a high quality signal across the network are your requirements then this system will do the job	1
i woke up and will not do anything now	0
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
the scene mode works really well for the kind of things that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
despite this minor issue i highly recommend the book to anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
in that model school the teacher just died one morning before my class	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
however some of the more bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to disconnect both it and my computer from the internet in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
value comparing data storage with price	1
there are a lot of limits to what you can do with frequency response because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
easy enough but it did not work	0
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price which was about more than what i paid on amazon for this player	1

even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
note that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
both units are small with similarly small arms	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1

i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
this is the best i have seen	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my lemon was not damaged and came in perfect working condition	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
well flash photos are great and there was still a lot of light	1
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
great features	1
scroll button switch	0
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1

ripping off the layers and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1

i will never buy a creative product again	0
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
the design is sleek and the color is good and the screen has good resolution	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
i have not had any distortion issues with the screen and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve ever used	1
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
i think that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to get your hands on the warranty	0
the sound this slim design brings out	1
the software on the other hand is pretty good	1
overall rating	1
harmless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
the software is	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
it is small	1
the remote is a little hard to find	0
made call which was immediately answered by the police	0
creative mediasource although not as powerful and powerful as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to the web	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a lot of music as it will act as the equalizer for you which can be a big help	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
the remote camera and fileviewer that comes bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
i love you and it has lasted	1
even better you do not have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
sharp image	1
the sound quality is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend a lot of money on computer speakers	0
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
it took a while from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
a anyone who has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as me	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected back to the modem	0

hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
mp is about right for the target market for this product	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1

the buttons and buttons on the keyboard are very easy to use	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via usb	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
i purchased a new battery and it got fried while being recharged they charged me for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the battery	0
then sorting the files into folders	1
it has good color and price was great	1
now that i have all my data on it there has not been any more problems	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to work in any other way	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many pages to get to the one you want	0
this machine is a great tool for your desktop	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is amazing	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its not too complicated and the default settings provide excellent photos if you do not want to bother with the settings	1
i try navigating using the player is built in menu and it still is nt working	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed to out of the box	0
i have attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a variety of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the unit	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby performs	1
overall i like the phone for its features and performance	1
price gb	1
recent price drops have made this the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
p s it does seem to be a little slow at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
best in class sound	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
sturdy and compact	1
best tech support i have ever had	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
the sound quality is really good	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
i think the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
i am doing this for just and there is no end to what i can do for just	1
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
this is my second time playing with this player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
on the positive side the sound of the speakers is very good once you have everything configured	1
i am very happy with this product i love the quality and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1

this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1

got a system error problem days after purchase	0
these monitors are great for reading	1

i simply love this feature	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works well	1
if i were to give them a star i would be giving them a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that i want them for	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
the progressive motion control on the tv can be turned off or on by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and most intuitive remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
the player has the ability to choose which will fix the glitches if there are any	1
i have been very disappointed to find that there is nothing to do with it just a crude and incomplete instruction of how to use it which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality great hd size and price make it a great value for money buy	1
the modem still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the router he said it was useless	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
i have had no problem at all with this product	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works very well for me but many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
you ca nt have to go overboard with these if what you are looking for is a good deal in a small package	1
what i do nt like is that at lower levels of music listening tonal qualities are very low	0
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
great camera great camera	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
the players are top notch	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
it is easy	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i can make free ringtones from midi files you can make graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps for	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like some of the other android phones	1
for a price that is still less than half of what i was paying to get this gb monster and the best part is it is just as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
my house is very small so it is hard to judge the quality of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked very well and was usable in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
lrb i would say that lrb have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be used on any device i own that feature rrb	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
but for what i do use it is great	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
i think this speaker really rocks	1
not only come with annoying songs and annoying rings there is no ring that is even close to a regular ring	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear them anymore	0
price	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i was ready	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to your phone to ring when they call	0
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to some good music on your ipod than heavy metal no problem	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
solid resistant to corrosion and better heat dissipation	1
the sound quality is very good	1
i have yet to try using all the different modes like shutter priority aperature priority light priority aperture priority etc but all of them are well thought out and and the manual is very clear	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
wyja nienie fantastic esp w iphone docked	0
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
it seems that it only seems to work if you re away from the player for a while but that could have been just the batteries that came with it	0
when the video output quit working	0
my first impression	1
one last thing i would like to add is this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
i like the zen stars because it is excellent for the league that it is in and it is not too much to ask to rate it based on players in a different class	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
i should ve trusted my instincts about the terrible repair team of acer	0
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
the fm radio is cool	1
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than it should have so i uninstalled it and stuck with the old one	0
the appearance is okayed	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
however since i am in an apartment i normally only listen to them at high volumes and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
usb cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
the functionality of this app is mind blowing	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are great	1
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i purchased the new jukebox zen xtra gb and it is amazing	1
this product is definitely worth a try	1
i was surprised to find out that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to watch movies on a dvd but it also was able to play mp files which i had never seen before	1
but this is not documented in the book neither the hard copy nor the paperback	0
video output of workin	1
how to use the automatic transfer feature on creative lets you review a transfer before it begins its transfer	1
fm receiver it has none	0
coca cola says it has failed to deliver on quality	0
it may	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
despite the things that i dont like i could not be happier with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to and from to the store etc etc	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the door would not close	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
great minds	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
i am glad they have decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
while my iphone and plus have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers so it is hard to hear some audio	0
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
the camera is good and the editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
i like the idea of a key lock function	1
i would get a hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again then the system would crash	0
overall an excellent phone	1
this was very prompt standard shipping and handling	1
that is a rare and valuable specimen	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
small print	1
however my hard drive did fail and i have not dropped it once	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access the internet very well at all	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does not work at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the first and the second from the same source	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
the remote is flimsy feeling and has no buttons	0
i m sure it will be fine and can be useful in a quiet setting one where you really only need your voice to be at a whisper	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
i have had the nomad job for about three weeks now and i love it	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
i did nt think i would find this easy to use and ease of use for under i was thrilled with it	1
it took me a while to get it working and i was momentarily disappointed that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	0
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot to anyone who is looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
the netbook i bought was the same as the one i bought for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it worked better than my own netbook so i will change to this one	1
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
way less expensive than the alternatives	1
check out to google com for all the features	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend cant stand it	1
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them and look forward to august when i will convert our other family phones from at t to t mobile	0
this led to thisthis is fantastic	1
easy to pair	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
i thought it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a video it just wasnt up to the task	0
over all a fantastic experience with this camera which made me want to experience photography on a totally new level	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
the quality and base is amazing	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
user name battery	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
very easy to set up	1
died in	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the bass with a sweet little sub	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
exasperated at am i right and will be sending this awful deceptive email back	0
its small size which might not seem to be a problem except if you use it while running or if you keep it in your pocket	0
so easy to set up had no problems	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
its far more difficult to use than the ipod and has no easy to use on the fly software creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does not come with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ip	0
i wo nt going to go into too much detail here as i wont go into great depth in this review but i am very pleased with both the speed and the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
progressive scan player for a fraction of the price	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
for instance i made several mash ups of the dvds using both r and r and it plays the dwds	1
i have ice age and it is awesome	1
the numbers appear one at a time taking up the entire screen and the user has to know or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by pressing the number keypad	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy weight for its weight it is not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
while i am satisfied with the performance of the phone in every regard i would not buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is amazing	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
the first set i received had a lot of audible noise coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
the connection to the other machines seems awesome much better than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this is a great solution for me thanks	1
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
for the price and the quality and the performance you can t beat the price	1
have tried to contact you via e mail but the e mail address has been blocked	0
the car will keep running for the rest of its life just like any other battery powered appliance	1
best in class performance	1
also has a nice guest feature so that you can connect separate of your own guest link	1
the story broke after a month	0
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking a picture it would be much easier	0
the sound is pretty good for the price although not anything like a surround system and there is some distortion but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you can see you own reflection on the screen	0
finally making playlists from the album which can be confusing because the tracks are listed individually and are followed by cd which are not listed but are linked	0
the driver negotiated the speed just fine and presented the driver with a gige link	1
over for the price this is a good unit	1
what got me to buy it was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of movies	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice for you	1
nice and compact	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
good looks	1
you can blame the bad chat support or whatever for that because i tried to give you all the information i could	0

i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on a house i paid over dollars for	0
all other buttons are very sensitive to touch and work very well	1
they have a whole bunch of them in the us that all have the same sounding name	0
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
bright visible screen	1
d link does not provide mac drivers however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
i dont know about you but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
the last year has been a steady performer for me	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
sound quality is good and i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
the button is finicky it is not hard to press but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have a very low satisfaction rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
im upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time there is always something going on	0
this camera is worth every penny and i would highly recommend it	1
other tagging problems result from the fact that it is operating system	0
but with that comes lower quality	0
the features are really cool too	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
navigation is easy and i found that copying and pasting files from the hard drive to the computer was easy too	1
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the best i had ever used and the worst i had been using for years	0
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend it and it is expensive	0
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
the internet connection is out of the phone wap and it will only work through t mobile which is a problem because they have removed the menu options that would allow you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
sound quality is good	1
when i tried to use the same dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1

i guess it was nice while it lasted	1
this dvd usually plays dvd is but has some issues such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie and every time we played it not being able to find the special features on a rental dvd	0
material is on the cheap side	0
yes there is a corner lens barrel that is in the corner when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize corner distortion and that is what they did exactly ot do	0
i hate widescreen monitors	0
all and all i am very pleased with this project	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple	0
it has a x optical zoom which is a first for these cameras	0
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
the woofer is much larger	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
this one really won me over and a big seller was the size it fits in your hand and into your pocket without falling out	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction issues poor product support difficulty to use and reasonably consistent complaints from users about problems with the headphone jack	0
and so far have not had any problems with any of them	1
excellent heavy metal quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of the stadium	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
you ca nt your decision is irreversible	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k	1
it looks great and is very easy to use with features	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good prices from a friend and we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
all the buttons and controls are on the left side of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
i like this player	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
i think the color is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
this phone is a winner	1
i m not very happy with it	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
the prints are beautiful	1
the power button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
the noise cancelling earbuds are average so just use your regular headphones instead	1
the router connected to all my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	0
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
whether you are taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch with friends you will be glad you had the opportunity	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
in short if you re someone that is a little bit afraid of technology and you just want to be able to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and not have to worry about it all day this router is great for you	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of its low priced calling plan and the fact that it has direct access to my corporate email	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
nice little car very light compact	1
the quick sync is nt any good at all it either needs to be configured properly or just is not very useful	0
this time the d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router was trying to auto negotiate the connection between my d link and the router from my fios optical network block	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
i can give this phone to anyone anytime	0
plusses are the ability to remove your clothes and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
even though the sound quality is poor it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
my biggest problem with this is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
the catch with the g lens is that its small size will cause you to miss precious shots	0
just received this camera a few days ago and i love the features it has	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
it is a fun little gadget do not expect high definition sound	0
operating its many features is not easy i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at home	1
what the hell is going on with this thing	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
it is highly recommended otherwise	1
the list of sound options has an interesting feel almost like winamp with the options	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any sound to the user	0
they look fantastic	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
that is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
the customer support is very rude	0
the controls are a little harder to get used to than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and i at the beginning did not think they would be enough to justify the huge difference in price	0
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
when the person speaks the voice is not very clear	0
now for the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is great and the sound in the back is perfect fast as hell in the front the buttons are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and i ve used	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
it has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras as it needs to be charged while in use but it also enables you to use the camera while plugged in to avoid running down the battery while shooting	1
first i ll start you off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in the quality	1
it did also seem to have been around for some time	0
the software mediasource can not work on my pc	0
this item was the most expensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
fragile	0
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
the features are really cool like the radio	1
i tried it as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
its black magnesium finish is stunning and the autofocus and shutter speeds are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get the hang of it	1
a great system at an incredible price	1
minor complaints are that even though the music is sorted by id tag on the player the ability to search for music by id in a folder is unavailable	0
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
the scroll bar that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
i chose this camera because of its ability to shoot for very high quality clean images	1
this is one of the nicest movies that the internet has made	1
they are not wowable good	0
so far i have no complaints and i would recommend this to anyone who values quality over appearance also anyone who wants a quality based mp player and wants to pay less	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
the original dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not be turned on	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain songs with no problems on blu ray but not on the dvd	0
this router was well worth the money it shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use set up instructions we have nt had to re set the router at all so far and it is delivery so my wife is no	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player doesnt break it just breaks fast which is why he is so good	1
file picture	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear to the police	0
i i d say this is a decent router for the money i d i d	1
software development	1
i am quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
have had the app since xmass and love it	1
her work is phenomenal	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
but then again it can be so loud that i heard it from the other side of my office when i was working out on the street	1
it also has a great feel and weight to it	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound quality	1
great minds	1
all in all it is very easy to use	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the buttons on the phone are small enough for my small fingertips but you get used to them pretty quickly enjoy	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it so much more fun to use i love this phone	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are amazing and you can see the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt been able to get to all of them yet	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
thanks to the fact that this is a return policy i was able to return it at no loss on my part	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what you see in the pictures	1
the next day i tried it again and it connected to the network but no longer had a connection	0
i ordered it on a monday and it was delivered on tuesday around pm rrb and with no shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
i bought this for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
i love this player and i will probably go with creative labs again	1
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
this is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
this video is very powerful	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
apex is the best cheap quality dvd player for dvd players	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
and for the price this is the best phone one could have	1
the colors and everything are beautiful	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
the second lasted about two and a half minutes before the video went out	0
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
i did not get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how many times i rebooted my pc reset the device etc etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
the router has obviously problems with this program and numerous other programs	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
you can see the lens barrel here	1
seems like a good product	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
mr trump is very rude	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
i started accessing and transfering files to my computer and uploaded it to github	0
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since that s not what you are buying it for	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
all in all this is a very good deal for anyone who has a small desktop computer and wants a lapdesk and a keyboard	1
i think i like it	1
the speakers have a very good soundstage with good treble and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
featured image	1
my stress level is ok	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless or wi fi	0
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
compared to anything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
get it it is woth every penny	1
when the screen was on the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
recieved this product in time for a gift giving event and really like it good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
so far the router has worked well	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the speakers are able to fill out the sound outs exceedingly well	1
it has very good range much better than the car it replaced	1
the canon g is perhaps the best out there	1
it also has a very interesting and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
what a disappointment	0
i think youll love this feature	1
the reason i don t recommend it a lot is because of that darn diopter adjustment knob its very small and hard to see so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
easy to do but it did not work	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i am so glad i was able to go with them	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
i have gb out of the computer i loaded my entire library of music which is nt that much songs and i have	1
as a non technical person i was surprised to see that the whole process was done in less than minutes	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
key words	1
the replacement was even worse than the old one which was now working fine	1
great picture	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
we got to the end of the nemo chapter and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
with this app you can modify your sound with different effects and effects which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
battery life	0
i find it to be a great buy	1
well i hope this does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
sub woofer is large	1
apparently t mobile phones are expensive and can t keep up with demand	0
i would not be inclined to purchase it again	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
it came out	1
the headphone jack is going to be a major problem	0
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
it has lots of great things my favorite being the games and the music and the radio	1
good battery life	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
loved the slim design	1
this router is the best i have ever used to date	1
these speakers are great	1
it does not have an auto focus assist feature which is nice for low light shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low lighting situations	0
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the world is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
a little bit sore but otherwise fine	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably make more of them	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
the colors and everything are great	1
i love the storage in there	1
i think this is the best you can get for the price	1
i m m	1
it may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does not come in the overused blue	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
minimal pause between songs much better than that on other devices good achievement for apple	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
it had a heavier and more durable plastic casing	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows with firewire do not have a firewire card and do not evenhave firewire cards themselves	0
it would spin and then read spin some more and then it would show on the display that there was no disc	0
this is amazing	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the driver on my pc i did receive a message that there was a problem with the installer	0
you can stop looking this is the only way you will find me i am writing this on nov rrb	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
some features in the user interface	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
the inside pics are great but when you can instantly see things you do nt like that are not in focus or need lighting adjustments it makes this camera very simple and easy to use	0
the wifi has its pros and cons i like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it will not work which means i have to turn off and turn it off again which is not to my likings	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
i love this guy	1
mediasource did not install on my computer	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
it comes equipped with lot of bells and whistles and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
it is very light weight and has a good amount of strength	1
but about of dvd is i cant get the picture to play on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and then the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
it is easy to use and it is very feature rich	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the excellent polyphonic ringing tones are great and it also doubles as a radio which is a nice bonus when you are bored	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
i remain extremely disappointed with this router	0
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
samsung galaxy s has a system error problem days after purchase	0
i tried called apex court but service no help	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
all in all bad product and bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
after playing around with it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
it makes up for this by being very easy to use with a very well laid out interface that can be learned quickly	1
it works on basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped from the library and the rental i bought that could nt be played on	1
this is awesome	1
the time from in the box to it working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
bottom line it did not work as well as it was supposed to so we re returning it we need this router for our two computers	0
price along with the quality of the battery were the most important factors on why i picked the nomad	1
i ve been doing the same thing by clicking on the s and the s seems to do only slightly better	0
the screen is bright easy to read in the daylight with no glare	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the same span of time	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is one of the best out there	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
with gb of storage i have about items on my hard drive with room for about more	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the color is red and is so beautiful	1
the data rate over the network storage is a bit slower than i would like but i only use it for occasional backups so it does not bother me too much	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
this is extemely lame	0
they will not answer the phone and the phone line is constantly busy	0
just an average user getting a lot of value in this product	0
the interface in itself which should be user friendly was anything but user friendly	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going well	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive to use	1
and it holds sooooo much more	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
monitor was easy to set up and i was able to see as promised with my newly acquired reading glasses	1
the operation with the netbook was flawless with the windows starter professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter does nt work at all and nobody knows about this	1
i find this to be very interesting	1
bottom line i have a great set of tools in the creative labs i trigue and i can make my own lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
first of all the player is better than the ipod second it is superior to the ipad	1
it does not only have the ability to play jpegs it even has the capability of properly playing dvd movies	0
when i went to a place where there was metal i was concerned that the music would not be as good	1
speakerphone	1
the speakers are fabulous and their is a lot of music to it there are tons of features i have not even gotten to	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it so i could look at them on the computer and edit them	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
also it was only with one player so overall it is a good game	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
neither message received	0
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
but he never fails to amaze	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
works out	1
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the software i am using is very easy to install and set up	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now and i am very happy with it	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
the camera is a pleasure to operate as it not only looks great but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
view this screen	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
a week out of the box and i began to see the red light at the bottom of the screen and it was growing more frequent each day	0
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
and with the new app transferring data to your player is incredibly easy	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
this thing is trash	0
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed down to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
too difficult to change genre album track list is too long for large number of tracks	0
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
because she is beautiful	1
creative commons amazons customer support website is useless	0
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
the software sucks	0
the rate plans are also very good as well	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
i think these speakers are more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software that was installed on my computer to load songs and albums from my library	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
i am listening to them and they generally sound good	1
i will be able to use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
the sound quality is very good	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
first the cons a bit bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does not have the best	0
the downside is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is unusable	0
it has a long battery life fm radio with fm signal hands free speakerphone and many java apps	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was still missing and features not available	0
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
excellent battery life of hours beats ipod is	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
this blog is good for me to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
it is made of plastic	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
i will never buy a creative product again	0
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
we got two phones for the t shirt family for christmas and one of them died with a broken headphone and one died today after less than weeks of use	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
there is a full screen of menu items to choose from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for there are no shortcuts as you can t use them	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt change a thing	1
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
the connection is weak and constantly dropped	0
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
the instructions that come with it do not explain how to make things simple	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
i find it too bright	0
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is not a display of the zoom size so you have to scroll down from the top of the screen and that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no sign of life	0
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
p s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error	0
mixed bag i think but the price was right	1
only thing missing from creative is a fire on the back burner	0
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
full capacity	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the scroll bar is empty	0
the aff feature did a very good job of converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
the sounds were as the music directors intended	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
i have stored everything that is on this and have not even touched the available memory	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
the zen stores data in memory but does not store files nor does it allow files to be opened or programs to be run	0
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this computer as well as a few gigs of media files in the same folder	0
t is which does not run along the same route or on that same route	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can be a bit loud for such a small speaker system	1
so besides the annoyances this is a fine speaker for the amount i paid	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
image rrb is the same as lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
for the money and the machines have good features	1
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works fine	1
the iphone plus has a wonderful set of features	1
the player ratings are also flawed	0
it does have a lense cap but it is nt very noticeable unless you take a photo with it on which is not good	0
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color missing compared to the original	0
the good news is that the unit has both coax and coaxial audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the brochure i d scanned before buying	1
the sound from the player is ok	1
i love these machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
the remote is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
worked fine	1
very convenient to work from etc	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have a good grip you should be able to handle it	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
protective case is useless as is since it obscures display window	0
d my support was polite and tried to help me but just worked on my case and was unsuccessful	0
the problem was that the software did not work right	0
but after days it still worked but the video quit working	0
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
the unit works great with my car and the adapter for my car is very easily worked without taking the car off the road	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
does what it should and the world seems fine with it	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the possibilities with the manual and the new scene mode which offers optimized situational settings such as portrait landscape beach or sunset etc are endless	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is very good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size but perhaps the bass is a little lower than expected rrb	0
great product that works perfectly for my office	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
this is so lame	0
received apex dvd and the picture was fine when i hooked it up with s connector	1
anyway this player is a big deal and i really like him	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the near future however if i do i will be sure that with this product it will be taken care of for me the service of amazon in getting this item	0
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
i think i like the unit	1
no problems with reception of signals unlike the previous system it replaced which only lasted months	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features make this player one of the best on the market	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work together	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the macro works great for macro shots and the auto mode is great for point and shoot	1
overall the g has what must be considered the best image quality of any of the megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
her response was prompt	1
i have to send my ad back to apex because it wo not allow me to play certain disney and other american movies	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
what bothers me is the fact that it does not allow me to read the dvds	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device you can only buy the music you need for your music collection	0
a lot of a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
key instead	0
it is so small but big enough to mac	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb drive and have it connected to external storage	1
overall	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
the first one we lost was to a car accident and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for it is loud and super easy to install so you are not going to want to mess with it	1

quality quality quality	1
audio files	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
the only thing missing is the speaker which is very thin	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
amazon was very nice about picking it up for me and paying for the return shipping	1
you can not get a decent mid range or bass at these levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you turn the knob	0
it still fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
the second part of the puzzle is working just fine	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
it is small light and compact looking and the display is decent too	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
the world is crap	0
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features such as a currency converter and a stopwatch	1
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
picture quality in outdoor mode is indistinguishable from indoor mode	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is very user friendly and idiot proof	1
the problem is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items are always in great shape	1
good looks	1
transfer through windows explorer is also available as a drag and drop tool so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the same reason	1
i have been working on it for years and now it shows a mixture of text and de focused text	1
i bought this dvd set for myself at christmas because it has been getting good reviews as a good value for the money on a lot of different sites	1

this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
then my dvds would either be playing in the middle or not even be playing at all	0
it was a snap to set up and my laptop my asus eee netbook droid and my ipad all connect without issue	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
the phone is small light and very compact	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there right now	1
sound is very good and the bass is very deep as well	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find the nikon to be a great product that i can recommend	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
making the cds was a bit time consuming but i think it would have been with the new system as well	0
great phone i d buy another	1
they are not the same	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
i found the system very intuitive and learned how to use it quickly	1
it is a great travel companion for you if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
my phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
get it it now	1
the price performance looked just right	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
it is running out of space for all the dvds i have and more	0
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
unfortunately it can t play that way	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
if you do nt do this it ll lump all of your tracks into the same file and they can not be searched for as the search engine does not know the difference	0
even the name of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
c i do love the new music player which has a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
nokia and t mobile really need to team up well on this baby	0
anything this thing does it does perfectly	1
when it works its great but i have had to go through monitors now both with defective switches	0
with the smooth knob i find it hard to tell if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel or not	1
after seeing and listening to the sound of the i tour pop speaker i have decided	1
audio is excellent	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that jumped out at me is how good the screen is	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it needs to do	1
but this camera is great	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
bottom line	1
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
it is ok to use musicmatch if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i started the zen and guess what	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
fact is it could nt be easier to do	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
when the player was working it was not a problem but	0
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
so besides the fact that this is a great speaker for the amount i paid	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
i gave it only a few days to get used to the fact that the st one broke when i tried it from a fairly short distance	0
it is quite powerful	1
i really love this netbook	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
the battery life is amazing	1
it worked great and we just plugged it in	1
the person on the other end of the call can help you out	1
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
great camera	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
its kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite radio station and the handset itself does nt weight much at all its light and compact	0
it has good color and price too	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
it also has extensive coverage through our two story series	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
even viewed in a folder full of jpgs	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
the backlight will periodically go out the first time it did i took it in for warranty repair	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the clouds were nt moving i thought they were awesome	1
after a long time i finally upgraded the dd wrt to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrth is website and it has solved all my problems	1

despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
great sound very long battery life very fast battery life great battery life removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
folders can not be created for the audio files	0

they do look pretty good in the dark though	0
it is very difficult to navigate around in this device	0
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1

it is versatile and is considered to be one of the best	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of them	1

the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
apex ad runs on dvd r rw and dvdr rw including dvd re rw	1

i have sent e mails to them requesting an interview with no response	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
i give it a rating of out of for looks	0
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews were negative	0
this is great i like to use it to pick up the stains on my countertop and i like to listen to music while i do it thanks	1
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
it is also a bit more expensive than expected but that is ok because all i need is for it to work	0
the good thing is that the backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is bright enough for people to see	1
i think the main reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a device that can t do what you can and for a fraction of the price	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1

no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i like the look of this little critter	1
how mp is compared to ipod is	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an external case you can not use the ipod without first removing the case	1
the pictures are so clear because the camera captures the minutest of details	1
everything was going well until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level all the time will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
i found using this app to add your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using the app itself	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
the lcd screen is	1
this is one of the best iphones for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
the image quality is excellent	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
door broke after a month	0
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1

unfortunately the computer would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in the fire	0
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough at	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
i spent hours on that and i could not connect to the internet	0
the dvd player is fine	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt work and the sound eq was a limited band effect	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
i tried to play the song three times and	0
what a junk	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
not counting the time i had to listen to the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
it has never worked	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
software is easy to use	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
turning to the camera	1

i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
how this product was created and was left behind	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
ipod mini it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
works super easy	1
they claim to have fixed it in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a fix	0
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
overall i was able to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features to choose from highly recommended	1
it has an offline option and i can listen to music anytime	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
when i tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd that the media disc is that it would play but it was unable to play cheep media that i had made that i could not afford to buy	1
the on radio button on the front of the router didnt work because the gui one wasnt working so anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the button	0
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the plate could be removed	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
the voice that came from the speakers sounded like carnegie hall	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
the size is small	1
pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
the function lever the one which switches things on and off feels fragile	0
yes the features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
no changes to the format	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
quite simply the firmware and or the hardware that is in this thing is not up to par for prime time	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
the quality is superb	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the mp file on a cd and the mp file on an xtra sounds justas good as a mp on cd player	1
the monitors were both good	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
i just read this and i have to say that i love it	1
you can be very far away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
i am so tired of what i think is product quality customer service that i will never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
it is tall so i ended up putting it on top	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
technical support support	1
the sound in the room is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca not hear a thing	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
the optical zoom works great and the digital zoom is a very nice addition although the results at the highest digital zoom are a little disappointing	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the computer direct from the manufacturer and shipping was outrageously fast	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar stores and they both delivered to my door	1
i am nt a fan of having an external tv antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is great	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
sound great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
i found it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote control for the audigy nx	1
the results showed that the download speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as well the results are shown below	1
the first one has worked good for years	1
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
seriously this guy has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
unit worked great for weeks then crashed when the output failed	0
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
after nearly years i have found that my camera takes incredible pictures	1
does not recognize player at random times due to being connected and the player is library	0
easy to read	1
i have a complete set of these everywhere in my lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
the size is a little bit smaller than the ipod and it has the ability to play music alittle bit more	1
as i mentioned the scroll wheel is average at best not difficult to use or horrible	1
well it was nice while it lasted	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
it is more than a picture and it does not show the picture at all	0
for those of you that like to tinker i think this offers some advantages	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
it was very easy	1
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
the creative labs zen game has the same features as the other games it has and if you buy if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
i did nt read a word of it it was just intuitive	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
however you do get what you pay for in the end	1
the build quality is top notch	1
not only is it functional and useful but it is also eye catching	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
but when we got to the house there was sound but no picture	0
the battery life is good takes about hours to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between uploads	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
i am sure this unit will have many uses in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be a good one since creative will only warrant it for a few years which in itself is a good thing	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
and as long as amazon has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
both the black and the white versions are economically priced and are well worth it	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will still reboot your computer saying your computer is authorized even when it is not and it will ask you to tell it that your computer was authorized	0
very good in the vertical position and seems to be better in the horizontal position	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty damn sweet	1
the other controls are all the same	0
the ringtones included are the following oh and did i mention they were polyphonic	0
the world	0
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
difficult navigation i wo nt want to say difficult but i do not enjoy the scrollwheel to much	0
the user interface the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
also the player sometimes doesnt have a helmet not a very big problem but can still be annoying	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i agree with the person who said that there is a need for a vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
so it was useless and ugly as with all software bundled with it it was unusable	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
would nt do it again because of the customer service	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
your health is fine	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the code was nowhere near stable and the code was in a beta stage at best	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
color screen is good	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb devices attached to this particular router to be seen in the actual networked network be able to access the desktop portals and be connected to the internet drag and drop upload attach etc	1
overall i like it	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommend the canon to anyone	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
in the hands of a person who does it right it will yield good results on idiot proof auto mode	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
the picturers are amazing	1
this did nt bother me too much because it wasnt my fault	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to music	1
delivery was prompt	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
one complaint the screen is too small	0
despite its being much larger than the ipod i must admit i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
they have a pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
my favorite camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with the addition of new earphones and software	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
the only other minor issues i can think of are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
since it would not work as advertised i decided to contact support	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some other benefit to this that i do nt know about	1
this is my first digital camera and what a great camera it is	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
i have tried several times to get in touch with them through their on line support site and their website but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
the usb port on the back is a very nice feature	1
of course i was sceptical given the price but i ve been extremely impressed with the quality of it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it before which does nt sound that bad until you have done it a few times in a row but that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it	0
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is not really robust and i agree with what others have said though not as good it could still work better	0
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
it is just such a nice light weight non battery powered device which you can use anywhere	1
people were uncomfortable	0
set up wpa with no problems	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
my one issue with the mediasource software is that when you are pulling i d data from the cdds file the ripping process fails to take into account the year field	0
im on mine	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
and even at this size you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
i needed three batteries to charge myself for a week with the s but the battery pack is a real powerhouse	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
the quality is excellent	1
the door will not close	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
cocaine is too fragile for normal use	0
seriously i love it	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
our special friends at creative studio have given this thing good sound quality great features for the price long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
the pictures come out a lot better if your hands shake only for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
although i agree with most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw with the eax	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was turned on	0
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
for the price there is nothing better	1
one other thing to note is that the headphone jack is unique to apple so other headphones will not work	0
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
silverish color really nice	1
but this camera is	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
i tried to make sure i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fell out	0
the grain was terrible	0
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
great price	1
it also does nt have the option of dialing big minus	0
they deliver an audible sound when hooked up and when receiving a signal	1
like it is predecessor the mp player this player boasts a decent size and weight a very good navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
i tried to read it and it took months to get through it	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
we are well pleased with the results	1
the screen is large and easily read	1
this book is great as a whole and is not like others with this title	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
this unit was working fine for the first hour and a half and then the color signal went out	0
i cannot work on my pc	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
this player is going to work fine with everything else	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
this is especially useful if you have little children in the house and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them while they are playing	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
this is by far my favorite movie in so many ways	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast and intuitive controls for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to go through menu options	1
this model will not work with my universal remote control	0
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size it is close to fine quality and the colours are very impressive	1
the gb zen place that does not wash my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
the best thing about the hardware is the buttons	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
took me a few days to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player and very easy to use	1
for those who want to buy an ipod just to say you have one and do nt use it this is a much better option plus you can store all your data on it which is a plus for all you music lovers	1
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
it wo nt play all of my movies	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
i thought the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network it stopped working	0
i took a chance with this new system and am very happy with the results in the long run it will cost more but that is the price for current state of the art	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos computer can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time to load and then it will say there is no disc	0
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
i loved it until it stopped working but a year is not an unreasonable period of time for something to work	1
screen brightness is really good	1
it is worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this regard it is in fact a part of the system etc is standard on all jukebox players but not	1
made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
great price for all the features	1
there is no way the battery supplied by	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub is too long and the distance from the station to the next station is too short	0
i ve also had the nomad in my room lock up several times	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
the fm radio is a radio station	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the phone is constantly ringing and making calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the ac adapter we can no longer use the phone we have to replace the ac	0
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
fixed speaker why do this	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
while going for a cellphone i was very determined to buy one only as it was the cheapest	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
very long lasting battery life	1
i will admit i am biased and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact better than my old radio	1
storage capacity	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
here is a picture of the box it is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the remote control but then it does not work and you are left standing there wondering what you are doing wrong	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
its ability to act as a back up for my music collection is amazing	1
this little camera has created a bond between myself and nikon never knew i could love a little camera so much	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex of the universe i don t have it	0
software is absolutely terrible	0
for the price and features it is really good	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started looking at the discs to make sure that the apex is actually there	0
the sound quality is very good	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
i ve had this done to me before and i am pleased with my decision	1
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
so far i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr that i have downloaded from cds	1
the quality of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this is a case where the company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have been using for a long time you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
after months it stoppped the release of higher number scenes on dvds	0
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
the sound is good and the volume is more than satisfactory for listening to music and shutting out noise	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
having a folder where i have no tags will cause it to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
the first routers worked good for years	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
forget about it if it can t play some of your favorite movies and dvds	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
i was a little surprised to see it in the low end	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
finding a particular song or album on the internet is fast and easy	1
last night i forgot to reset the router	0
the price is right	1
all i can say is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for the router that it does nt know what to do	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
i think it is a great sound for its size and price i do think that the volume for iphone and ipod are the ones that should be placed at the top of the measures to get the better sound quality so i do	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible and sometimes it was not	0
it is extremely light and easy to carry in your pocket	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
the problems came from my video card	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
this is a very decent monitor for its price	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
the environmental audio filter on my computer is now completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
i have not had time to really work on this one as time is stretched to the limit but audio aspects of it are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
this dvd play is basicly disabled	0
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
i have no complaints with this game or the player	1
proven canon built quality and reliability	1
the scroll wheel is a bit of a pain	0
i have had this player for months and have been able to watch a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of not being able to get the player to do it properly	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
i i d buy another	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
i wanted this to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
unfortunately after loading the app all i get now is a message saying its either not connected or busy	0
i think this player is awesome	1
folders can not be created for this purpose	0
technical support line the support line on the other hand was very helpful technical support linethe support lineon the other	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
the problem is literally nonexistent	0
the quality is very good	1
they are very agile and have no trouble balance wise or with their balance	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
uploading the images to the server is very fast and easy	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
months of hard work and it no longer recognizes anything	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great camera that takes great pictures and does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
the set up is goof proof and the result is a superior result	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine is doing just fine so far	1
the only downside is that there is a camera which requires a line of sight	0
there was neither picture nor sound	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
unfortunately the carrying case that came with mine doesnt open up the screen so even though the buttons are reachable i have to open it up to get to the display	0
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
over for the price this is a good deal	1
frame freezes and the family yells that there are somethings wrong with the dvd player come on	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
thuumbs up to acer mah and ultra slim monitor	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
software the software is crap	0
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
after a while it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
unfortunately as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main image with depth being lost	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
i like it is color better but it is not perfect	0
i am in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of features	1
i t	0
as it stands now the player is pretty useless unless you re setting the player up for a specific song or if you set up all your songs beforehand	0
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no backlight	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
works great	1
the device is small and well designed i would recommend it	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
connect the player to your computer and set up mediasource and you can listen to your favorite mp s as they come in	1
i would strongly recommend this book	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
not only is it cheaper but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
this is a list	0
i love that it is so light and that it feels more solid than a regular laptop	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more	0
beautiful home theater and music speaker with high highs defined mids and lows	1
well this dvd player is turning out great	1
price	1
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
i do not want to be a computer geek but this computer is incredible	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
i ve had no problems at all so far and i hope it continues	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily keep up with the cameras limitations because i ve never been able to do anything else with it within its resolution limits	1
however its x setting is acceptable for of the shots that i have taken	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
and then i had to figure out how to put my chinese songs in the title because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
it has all the features that you would need in a cellphone	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play a dvd while you are looking at it	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
i m also running in wall rated speaker wire and can accommodate up to speakers even through the groove in the bottom of the base	0
i was able to talk on the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
it would just spin up and stop and start again	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector was removed	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i do not agree with a lot of what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it like a new phone and now i re looking at it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
i have been using it since about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
p it is not lite on weight so i would not recommend it to anyone out there	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
not a bad price for but it is nothing special	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
some changes in the user interface	0
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
i do nt know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
takes excellent photos	1
simply the best camera out there today at this price point is the best digital camera out at today	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
overall i found them to be very nice small but having a solid feel to them	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
it is easy enough for a beginner to use	1
one other thing to note is that google chrome now supports this device via their software	0
i have over songs in my playlist at the moment and the album does a nice job of spicing it up	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
i did not expect to make creative nomad explorer friends	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
it came well packaged	1
price gb of storage	1
they are easy to use and perfect to be used in conjunction with a sub	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
it is still very quick and the quality is very good i can listen to the songs even with my usb headphones on	1
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about minutes for a cd on my pentium with x drive	1
it is slightly lighter than the previous model and packed with even more features	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems to be down resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has been a good movie for me during the time i have seen it	1
there was no	0
i will have to see if you agree with me about the quality of this speaker	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it so far	1
it does make you look pretty spending this kind of cash you know on something that has the chance to go a bit down of course	1
do nt buy this player	0
seems like a good product	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped it would for work study travel	1
battery life is good but i recommend you have a rechargeable battery or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on it	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing and for those who are very much for a computer speaker rrb this is not necessary	0
the fight against the poor design continues with the case	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
navigation could be improved but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
it is crystal clear	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
this is great	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
the infrared is also great if you have an old phonebook and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone book save me hours of work	1
it did play a dvd r which was the one i had in my older washing machine	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to be fixed is on its way to the store so i never got far enough to tell you this	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
i ve had this phone for just over a month and the headphone jack has never once come loose	0
i was dissapointed that acer was not more helpful	0
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts for a year on one single charge the software is great and it is easy to get in it chrome is great	1
small size	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
what makes the focus lock lag time so long is the extreme depth of field that is obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
recently purchased this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i have found that the quality of the picture are excellent with some fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and	1
i love that it is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
all i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	1
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
this product is amazing	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a good grip	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
the game itself is pretty solid	1
the controls are much inferior to these	0
kudos to you even though your products are of a lower quality your support is equal to that	0
so now it just plays everything you just can t play	0
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
update jan the device has worked flawlessly since	1
i am still very happy with the sound quality but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to back up my sound card is much better and every time i switch between the two the sound is much more acceptable	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
without any doubt at all if the image is real or not the colors are as realistic as i ve ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
the subwoofer is very loud and s l o w and it just sounds unnatural even with the subwoof know the volume is all the way down but it is not because these are bad speakers	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1

i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the wrong type	0
i only have one card left and that is the mb card included	0
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
the battery life is amazing	1
it is light enough to walk around in all day without bother	1
my overall experience with this monitor was very positive	1
there is also no back adjustability so it sits very close to the desk	0
this is fantastic and it is really nice to carry this around instead of wondering what kind of cd is or isnt it	1
very bad quality	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent book	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
same story as last time when trying to get service from them	0
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
the phone is great i do nt have any problems with it and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing it is great	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the app is sub par	0
transfering is easy to do and makes everythig pretty easy	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
i m delighted with this product	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
the display is very good and the text rendering is good enough that you can forget entirely about workspace issues	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to respond to two messages	0
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
it is only one out of three that is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of problems	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
when you turn it on your player the light turns on really fast and the music starts to play just as fast as you turned off it when you were turning it off	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
this camera is closest to the ground than any other digicam that is available	1

i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
the phone is as good as a cell phone thank god	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
nothing but hassle with this company	0
it gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has a level of simplicity that makes it easy for the novice to use	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
also the head cap design is flawed	0
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
i really like the quality of the pictures	1
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
the sound system has terrific sound and gets really high	1

you re going to need to buy a new pair of headphones the stock ones suck	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
things are much more readable and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb than i had to do with my big old monitor before	1
does not provide enough volume when compared to larger headphones or external receivers	0
focusing on a clothing rack about feet away from the camera during the night the pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
i found it was very easy to set up a new netgear to my old netgear as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
it sounds great in the shower or on my night stand	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the keys are a bit small and the layout is a bit weird in comparison to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
considering the price and specs this seems to be the best deal out there for a large memory mp player	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1

after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
the file transfer dialog hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
it has a beautiful design and a lot of features very easy to use very fast and customizable and the battery life and duration is amazing	1
this app is good with a huge array of apps and games built into it	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
the flowers are beautiful	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
you can adjust it to be just about anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a difference	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0

when the matrox dual dvi card comes out i will consider purchasing one more card	1
the more i work with it the more i like it	1

excellent and i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
it is lighter to carry around and it is more portable	1
i did not want one because i thought i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is not the case but i did alot of research and read a lot of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
the only disadvantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace the cheap user replaceable battery is not available	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is very bright and easy to read and use it is by no means a major advantage over the ipod	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
great size to display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone like this would have	1
