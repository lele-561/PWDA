i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1

the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0

the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0

i m easily visable pictures to x as no best loss in picture quality setting not even using the enlarging possible and with yet	0
so yes with with all software bundled as useless and ugly products it was creative	0
range was comparable to slightly worse the old linksys router or than possibly i had been using for years	0
exceptional from the supplier was the service	1
this means easily there is a good chance that break phone will not like typical american phones that this	0
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
the this camera on functionality is mind blowing	1
have they a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
if you do can artist tags all of your tracks and lump it not the same directory ll they nt into be searched via have or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
i ve viewed as different monitor models since poor m a college student and had this particular monitor as ve seen of picture quality numerous any i i	0

sure it had i the to but when all want features shoot a girl is basketball game it tried just up to the task	0
my only significant sound quality is complaint	0
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting if are and rarely hazy a little dull you tend take to photographs from a distance	0

this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
you the price and size and features for can t beat the price	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was able to return the product at no loss on my part	1
i found the nomad jukebox mediasource to load your songs using using to much be easier and faster than to windows explorer	1
i short owned this camera for a have for anything and nt would give it up time	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1

i would nt quality and ease of use i did find this think for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
a route it was as my old netgear very to set up also to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same easy	1
and really could is the best phone one this have	1
out sounds decent get i would estimate you but maybe the of quality that you would from a true line jack it	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
the woofer is much larger	1
have vocals greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one upon solely the indestructibility of it apparent	1
however do i nt like to carry it on off because the clip the case and is nt secure can slip my belt	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
mp is camera right for the target market of this about	1
good speed range	1
when does open smell like burning plastic it you nt the drive	1
contrary cocking to the shutter the excellent stopaction photos reviewers and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce halfway by to what other position experienced	1
it looks everything it claims sleek and stylish and does really	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
great camera	1
recently bought of along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that this coolpix qualities the picture are excellent with m m pixel of the user friendly functions combos fine many you are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera and that can see pictures immediately	1
remote the is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
they have devices whole bunch of sounding that all have the same a name	0
all that can say is i this is an excellent devise	1
for if you re game with this day forecaster a little fiddling you may be very pleased so	1
sometimes the system would hang to i would have so router the restart then get going again	0
widescreen i hate besides monitors	0
be i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to setup software for my application useless	0
a what junk	0
the speakers have a huge subwoofer for good bass also obviously not thumping bass you which and would need a very rich sound	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
all to all suprisingly easy in use	1
size using it i found after carrying to be perfect for the in a pocket	0
my house the real strenght small judge it is so to hard is of corners product all a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in through rooms and the with no signal interruptions	1
very long lasting battery life	1
creative mediasource software is bought the zen to rip catalog burn music if you are to from ok but i used musicmatch starting i my cds before scratch rip and guess what	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
the hangs player up file on transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
definitely more capable of any other computer speakers the room with sound than i filling ve owned	1
the eax for are pretty cool as well as creative has included a car extraneous of eq adjustments a train for compensate example features on number noise encountered in a or the that	1
a x optical zoom has it which is average for these cameras	0
this player is an ideal purchase	1
little a weighty but otherwise fine	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
in taken take photographs from a distance an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to pictures	0
one downside though is that work does is autofocus well when battery not low	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
keep m glad canon decided and the i mp resolution to improved upon it with new technology	1
the sound is although anything also lrb you not screen like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it the when display the in which case pretty see you own reflection on is off good	0
the menu options are scroll as you can t see looking of menu items to pick from you have a full screen uncreative up and down to find what you re to for	0
the macro works and for medical photographs great the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
it does nt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the speakers are nice no question about it perhaps is you the is range what good for the size than expected rrb expect from speakers this size lrb the sound even better might	1
were both good the monitors	1
i have find deal leaves been missing there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which to a great disappointed of information that	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
these are speakers bike great for the weekend cycling in the park	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
my other gripe is which the incredibly crappy remote is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
delete pics a not perfectly bit challenging but when you can instantly the inside pics you do nt like that are be focused can or need lighting adjustments this camera make very simple and effective	0
and sounds great with good mp the zen xtra well recored headphone s	1
this for the most part is a good dvd player	1
this to is good mode to integrate my clarion cx product toyota my camry enough	1
lrb yeah a you as dumb bridge rrb use a new returned dsl ll modem i very expensive the item and got like linksys dsl modem instead	0
range was comparable to or possibly slightly worse than the old linksys router i had been using for years	0
spending asthetics nt of pretty it this kind of cash you want something that has the does bit down look course	0
months of use it and no longer recognizes anything	0
no jack headset propietary	0
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
i did nt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and i m glad i purchased these speakers	1
overall i am this satisfied and very product with will be using it often	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
battery huge storage capacity can easy to navigate for the price modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable pros	1
it found i very another for transferring large files to useful computer	1
all in all bad from this product bad customer service run like hell device	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
as it is the case stands now pretty useless unless you re up beforehand songs for travel or if you load packing all your up the player	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
the environmental audio made has almost completely useless and is however most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
i do was think while hooked matters though i mean nt my xbox up to the standard vga port a little that ago and the picture really awesome	1
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
i am stunned and anything at the never of the raw images quality am getting from this g and can easily put amazed with the cameras limitations because i ve up seen i better within its resolution limits	0
it sounds decent but you of estimate you get maybe would would that i the quality from a true line out jack	0
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i ve of a portable radio the set transmitter unit with it it i well when to is it on top a but was awful trying worked use in the car which belkin fm somewhat of tried disappointment	0
this phone has as ir just to many other features one the features above i view the name most beneficial	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
i personally would environmnets this router in every small hold or house buisiness recommend	0
and wonderful product was easy to unbox this install	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to when it use i am audio books listening to	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
however shareport on this new router worked the of time	0
ve i also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
it also has tracking stock a app built in and a somewhat useful application all types of metrics converts which	0
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
people also have a window about the case not complained but offers very good protection that is not really a sturdy deal to me either the case is big and having	1
pick from are uncreative as you you t to a full screen of menu what see the menu options you have to scroll items to find up and down can re looking for	0
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
great phone d buy another i	1
i was surprised use the i was to when especially like to how good it i sound am listening and audio books	1
and love this player i would probably go with creative labs again	1
i easily this very paired to two different android phones	1
one beef work the scroll nt does it is as well as i d like	0
the only thing i m concerned about is quality the of longevity the buttons on the thing	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
is ok life battery	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound the by produced nomad	1
the software i the t understand why also does not ignore can when it lists the alphabetical in cds order	0
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
i have is around cd barely on this and have stored touched the available memory	1
phones is one of the nicest this nokia has made	1
is this the best phone i have seen	1
is then that it other a fantastic display for the price	1
think i still even with these shortcomings it is the best digital camera available under	1
i ve also had zen nomad the lock up several times	1
while i like the performance buy the phone one in every regard would of another i solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
when the purchasing dual ll card comes out i dvi consider matrox g one more of these super displays	1
in fact others say not enough bright	0
its heavier seem and much larger use might which far to matter except if you not it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
also nice a guest has feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
wire runs very clean the body through giving it a of the stand look	1
the interface used could be better designed	0
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
buy going to i was fully for a cellphone determined while a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
get it is it woth every penny	1
the macro and great for mode works the auto medical photographs is terrific for point and shoot	1

i can see this monitor and dell ultrasharp drastic difference a between in contrast brightness of terms and viewing angles	0
cons i think look ugly the satellites	0
player dvd the is fine	1
but if looking re you the apex dvd player my opinion of for i love it	1
finding a particular song or on the nomad jukebox album is fast and easy	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
and nice compact	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
these are great speakers	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
a picture this week very easy to use in was on a recent trip camera past is i fact asked to take the of a vacationing elderly group	1
exceptional was the service from the supplier	1
like means easily there is not good chance that this phone will a break that this typical american phones	0
the sounds were movie the as directors intended	1
other then fantastic it is a that display for the price	1
you to to going need re buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
games kind of stink and download them ca nt you you the link cable to get additional to get have games	0
extremely makes up for this by being it easy that to with well laid out controls use can be learned quickly	1
the remote understand a little hard to is	0
in the hands good results someone who will nt it does yield of on idiot program auto mode	1
wo i difficult navigation nt necessarily say difficult do i but nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
one user brightness is easy minimum brightness four presets and changing changeable for at night rrb i leave that at with lrb	1
if you are picky not about image quality go for it	0
also for some reason the looks picture of out on s video with lots washed color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
nice and small to when excellent it comes and from games graphics and ringtones downloading www crazycellphone com	1

i them these speakers and found tried to for well below expectations preform this price	0
is battery replacement compared to ipod is	1
can you see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
as a non technical surprised i plus person to install was cisco valet the wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
quite simply prime time and or the os that control this thing is not ready the firmware for	0

a week of the box and out i to began see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1

as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
small i rated it a adjustment is because of its darn diopter four hard to turn that very the reason and dial can you so t get an accurate adjustment	0

purchased did nt i one in which i a have of reviews put in batteries myself lrb i is would rrb i did alot of research and read a pain bunch to and that m glad want i these speakers	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
come earbuds that the with it are nt that bad	1
recommend the getting the superdrive and highly wifi bluetooth modules	1
