the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1

i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1

at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
just this two days ago love	1

the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
for a specific location think its a phone	0
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
but for what i it is perfect	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i receive a that was a problem installing the driver	0

the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and worked almost perfectly	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
ve attempted to connect this unit using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t a video signal from the machine	0
the first set i received had loud audible tone coming from speakers and had to be returned	0
there much has been said in reviews about the features of this phone a great phone mine without any problems right out of the box	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures does	1
made call was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
the speakerphone works better any speakerphone ve ever had	0
first night i got this phone next to me when i went to bed just to to my favorite music station and itself does nt weight anything its too light and so with it	0
everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
love	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that me is how good the screen is	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc enough	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid of money for a player that can t do half the this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
size bigger the ipod	0
awesome	1
overall a buy for the price	1
it takes to seconds to come back online i timed it rrb which does nt until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad gets sometimes goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
continues with the case	1
now i own it however i can imagine being it	1
the speakers very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
the manual mode easy to use with fast access for the selection of and without having to menu options	1
a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
i chose g because its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
it does well in internet browsing	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over ipod is	1
however since i am in an office i keep them at a pretty low and low volumes they sound a little weak	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
the top that covered the kept poping without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
in short if you just someone that is little afraid of technology and just a router to get online do basic networking play mafiawars and this router	0
of would repeatedly freeze during playback while on the player kept going	0
the works then it does not work and you are standing there thinking are doing something wrong	0
finally reiterate my thumbs down for t mobile as a carrier	0
the person on the other end call	0
this thing is trash	0
my dwl ap does not as repeater for di s and no firmware update support this product	1
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
eax on you modify your sound which pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
great picture	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color disappeared	0
nice machines but consider their quality pretty low now	0
the that this model would was a big plus for me as a visual artist and discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
screen brightness is really good	1
overall i like the unit	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
i find the apex ad to	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit across the house are your requirements then this will	0
the fm radio is cool	1
the problem that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been mb s even when in the same room	0
apex is the best cheap quality brand for players	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
the instructions that come with it do explain how to make things	1
now i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
would nt buy of the customer	0
the size is small	1
comparing data storage with price	0
the resolution and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
easy to pair	1
the canon g gives tons of control but still has an auto mode that makes very easy for the novice to use	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
last night i needed to reset	0
you can looking this is the best n router you find lrb am writing this on nov rrb	1
i just set up manually which is very easy	1
the dvd player fine	1
having go the netgear genie tool through the isp be far better	0
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake during the entire process of taking a picture	0
simply love this feature	1
it is easy enough to pop it open see what song you listening to	1
the has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are with things that expected this phone do	0
for that like tinker i think	1
the comes with is not good at all	0
but when we went use it again there was sound no	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
not counting i editing the songs the transfer	1
please firmware upgrade that all the usb drives attached to this wireless router be seen in the actual networked local computer portals and be able drag upload attach etc	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the battery charged for a time and no more than or hours most to fully via the included ac adapter	1
at the very a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find more just to canon is website	1
i have rated it five but for	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
storage capacity	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
function lever the one switches feels fragile	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
is by far the camera in its price and category have ever used	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
the more i with it the i love it	1
the is very functional and i use it in car very audible even with freeway noise	1
the perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
has unproven battery life	0
t is which not work along several long stretches on	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
it looks great and is	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
purchased nomad jukebox zen gb and it	0
quite although it take some getting used to	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig easy	1
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but that i have saved equalizer and know i to open up my sound card is control panel every time i between music and videos or games sound is much more acceptable	0
i very pleased with it so far	1
the battery life seems takes to charge uploads mp s and there is no delay between songs	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does	1
this is a great piece system for a and it worth every penny	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i m easily enlarging pictures x with no visable in picture quality and not even using as yet	1
crispness readability even extreme angles ca nt be	1
but you re looking for opinion of the apex dvd player love it	1
the picture is perfect although i m watching on	1
only owned it about two weeks i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan player higher quality very soon	0
on a display rack feet away in a brightly lit room day time pictures produced by this camera and in a shade of orange	1
this player is not worth price and recommend that you do nt purchase it	0
software is crap	0
the zen stores data but not a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
well had good power precision at all	1
over a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on phone	1
i system features and performance	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
anyway this player i really it	1
it very solidly built has a nice dense feel to it	1
i e mailing and they come back saying undeliverable	0
would definatley a friend and its volume can for such a small speaker	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but not as as when i view them on my	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
in comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
it does tend to and should given of room circulation	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not as as mm	0
have sent ad to apex because it nt play disney and	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
i tried calling the support number for a week several times and always got a busy	0
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
software the software is crap	0
awesome sound system	1
m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
sound exceptional though can really compare it to the ipod	1
the eax mode keeps the volume at the same level any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	0
for of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
when i it to use my daughter in longer lengths speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
played only one out of three problems other being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
overall is the best camera on the market	1
the replacable battery is great wears out you will able buy another easily	0
we this on was perfect condition as can be for in mind i m extremely computer savvy my opinion comes to a lot	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at not others	1
cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
took a chance this new product and pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
door would not close	0
yes the picture quality and features are too numerous to mention are for any camera in this price range	1
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is fast even accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
the macro works medical photographs and auto mode terrific for point and shoot	1
the picture quality and can and make silent that way if you	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
the auto setting does a great job most the time but there manual settings those who want them	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
agree with the earlier reviewer who said that is a very limited viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
again the were spot on projected from where they should the of the tv	1
it is running great all the dvds	1
needed to myself going with but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to a open the others are moderate or strict i contaced support they were tried thre best get it working right to no avail bottom line if just a a laptop and you will and very secure this router	0
however a phone call to d link support crew was answered in reasonable and guided me through the without a problem	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of	1
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities very poor	0
great good interface powerful battery good software up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
this did nt bother too much it is still a decent size	1
does not recognize player at random times despite connected and displaying player is library	0
i found to preform below expectations for this price	0
this little camera has a marriage between and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
also it was very easy set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
i turned on my laptop and it connected the network but no internet connection	0
great price for all the features	1
while upgrading the memory broke	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
try navigating to a chapter via the menu and it would nt do	0
i chose because what i it was for money	0
it running great all the dvds have and rented	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
they sound really good just as reviews	1
zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice there is a display the size one quarter of the way down the top the screen interferes with viewing at most settings	0
led monitor fantastic	1
network storage supposedly it is slow	0
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
it great	1
asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched but decided on this one and now that i it i could nt be happier and m convinced it is the best one out there	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
had no problems all so far and i very happy	1
but then it does not work and you are left standing thinking you something wrong	0
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
com for such a great price how you go	1
this is an excellent value	1
the netgear router simple to set up and worked well the couple to few months i have had it	1
apex cust help	1
delivery was prompt	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
i will never	0
this is a great camera	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
if you looking for a quality tower speaker this it	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
however my hard drive did and i have not dropped	1
the player has its minor glitches like when i turn it on percent of the time it sais which i to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
i m giving this stars as ve seen nothing of the problems have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt hissing or problems show up with me too	1
the sound quality is really good	1
i have not with all the features yet the is to use once you get used to it	0
but ve used a slr mm the controls are very intuitive	1
i m giving player cautious recommendation	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and responses they will it me if	1
manual is easy to understand and it	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt any easier	1
access to so much music where go	1
i got this thing for christmas and have been ever since	1
when i a lot of plastic there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i m very pleased with my zx so is a quick review	1
and it holds sooooo music and audio files	1
environmental audio however and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes the router to manually the the front gui one would work	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work t mobile is services they deleted that would enable to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
a great system	1
is another great hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
this item was inexpensive inch monitor available to me the time made the purchase	0
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
the sound this design puts out	1
these speakers are	1
the sound came from that cheap little record player like carnegie hall	1
even slightest of the shakes totally distorts	0
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad wrong with the dvd player	0
hooked it like a charm picture bright colors very light weight	1
key	1
they claim to respond in a hour period it weeks without a reply	0
in all i d say is a decent router for the money	1
living in small college apartment the e s and e s beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
c i do love audio sync which a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
they have whole bunch of devices that all have the sounding	1
they look fantastic	1
i use this with home theater system and it amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
great product works perfectly for my office	1
it so i ended up laying on its side	0
came and i was momentarily glad that rumors d heard acer tech support did nt turn to be in case	0
i m not one who uses easily	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player i ve seen	1
i like	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
i just hooked it up and seemed be going fine	1
wow this speaker really rocks	1
easy to hook up	1
acer has an extremely bright screen and its design the placement in an area lrb a heighth perspective rrb that will not fit in	0
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
i also did nt it displayed way down into the screen you in zoom mode	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged can t up demands	0
with box is that reboots several an hour if more frequently	0
the fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll poorly designed and does not well	0
this is a great little phone its features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and tiny	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off is and difficult to press	0
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
and so far have not had problems with dvds not being able to play	1
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1

started accessing and files to it to be extremely slow	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across this router will do the job	0
the manual is to understand it is mostly idiot proof	1
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they not be searched artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
because it help a so take spectacular photos	1

the dvd player had a faulty power which caused to not turn	0
the larger lens of g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets just that much closer	0

nokia and really teamed up this baby	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i because that is where my thumb is i hold the thing	1

for a price is still less i was able to this gb monster and is it works as great it was advertised to and then some	1
these monitors great for	1

quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this is not ready for prime time	0
this the third apex product i ve bought they continue to for the price	1
it but when i tried to shoot girl basketball game it just want up to the task	0
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
to use with fast access for the selection shutter speed and without having fumble through menu options	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
the price this is a good unit	1

for the theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
well within days the video output quit	0
this is a nice feature i e it is early the morning and you rather listen easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1

enough but it did not work	0
i do nt always for genre listings but it allows easy editing of	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0

price gb of storage	1
i m sure it would and can be useful a different one where would to be at a whisper	1
it sounds decent i would estimate you get of the quality that you from a true line out	0
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
after using it i found the size be for carrying in a pocket	0
valet plus is easy to configure and up about minutes	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
i had it it got into a state never find the device i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc is online support was help	0

best electronic i ve	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
great picture	1
i many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
ripping and creating playlists could be any easier	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
very set up	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
this router	1
the grain was terrible	0
i got it great great sound understand that the volume the towers own volume different things should be placed at the right measures get the better sound so i do nt complain the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
is finicky it works most of but there learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some that they just return the device	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
it exceedingly simple to around in this device	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i m very happy with these ll probably buy	1
full sound from to great highs	1
the features are cool like radio	1
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them to get the link cable to get additional games	0
for the money apex machines have good features	1
great speakers	1
this might be best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
clarity is great i do a lot of work in and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
the interface itself which be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good on a portable mp player to result good product	0
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
it	1
ll changing track information because the cd database by software is mediocre at best	0
this phone is great as a whole is not like others with one or two qualities	1
i love this player and extremely with my	1
nt so clear	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of that for example for in a car	1
menus navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an to	0
the are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
they fired away and the turned out quite nicely	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge for the buck	1
the keys are laid out normal there is no guessing	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
one also exhibited when going to the menu	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
the canon computer software download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer very nice	1
was neither picture nor sound	0
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
it because it looked easy to install	1
only con can think of is no camera	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
i bought this set it up and would not at wireless n speeds	0
this phone is a winner	1
had a jvc system that was years and i it but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody	0
these speakers are great	1
i ve played around with am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
also i can understand why the software not ignore the when it lists the cds in order	0
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
it built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best out there for a large memory mp player	1
and there is no end what i can do with it	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two afflicted by of glitches	0
this so many capabilities that you ll always room for new technologies as they evolve	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
the size is small	1
this is extemely	0
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
over a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on	1
i was by this very inexpensive player for first three hours and then it died	0
range is the best it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to on computer speakers	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
pc cable is too expensive	0
like installation was hell	0
speakerphone	1
because it can help a so photographer take spectacular photos	1
so good that my boyfriend	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made of my songs worse than without it	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display even though the side controls are reachable i have to open up to see the	1
i really love this netbook	1
excellent sound reproduced faithfully through jukebox	1
either way can t wrong this price	1
has been since the base constantly calls and now seems to be of short circuit in the base we no longer the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
is enough around all day without bother	1
at the very least a sturdier protective carrying case	0
is except maybe a tad too quiet at times when are quieter talkers on the other end	0
it easy for beginners to use but has features that so is an excellent camera to	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
the software is not good and the has trouble working with other sound blaster products which	0
the software very easy to use and minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
color screen is good	1
it is great phone you traveling over the world packed with wonderful features	1
the mount is easy to use it is velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
not only is more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
came back working and was glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support turn to be true	1
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
one other issue that is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
games kind of stink and you ca nt download them have get the link cable to get additional games	0
got a system problem after	0
finally making can be because the tracks listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are	1
i have this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
so slow that it not for files of any size or back ups	0
tech support from is literally nonexistent	0
first of the player is quality is superior to the ipod	1
the price performance looked just right	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion than an ipod	0
about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is	0
m tending to be a little conservative but really deserves five stars	1
it and yet feature	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
controls are harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten them and even the beginning not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
i was willing to live but the durability was a zero	0
hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
only i have that i nt liked the is hard to read daylight but everyone elses is too	0
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0

a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd to look at it and said that they would me repaing the damned	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0

even works better on g band than the linksys	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
however you what you pay for in products	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the is good	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1

a steady performer	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0

they do look cool the dark though	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant the indoor shots that subject is no more than about feet away	1
i d venture say that because of it is low cost it the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
that i found with the internet service is that does not access mls very well	0
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
i m delighted with this product	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz i was able figure out most of just messing around with it at a camera store	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery	1

after seeing and hearing the sound of i tour pop i was sold	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network seems overloaded	0
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard figure out	0
creative awkward difficult to and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
i found using to your songs to the jukebox be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
it also does nt have voice activated dialing big minus	0
you can manage your change the contrast of backlight make different of display either list or tabbed	1
does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots low light situations it allows to focus low light	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1

i ve been playing minecraft on it multi tasking the same time and while it does run slower while the gaming is not compromised for me	0
but i would recommend phone	1
it a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
the only problem that i have found is that does not access mls at all	0
sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music be placed in a folder called unknown	0
speed tests showed that the wireless were comparable to those of home wireless router using my home broadband cable modem as input	1

overall would these someone who wants a of at a reasonable price	1
kudos apple your products are of superb quality your support is equal	1
installation was hell	0

i fully it bad again in the same or some way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction	0
the pictures razor even in	0
the g has a type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down	1
you of have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
when the player was working was great but	0
so easy to set up some problems with my archos	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
is added in functionality as the face plate is prone to popping off	1

update is more mirror than silver and i it	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and zen xtra sounds just as good a portable cd player	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for s and there is no firmware update support this product	1
the battery is nice	1
do play on this dvd player	0
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
is small and attractive	1
this the best phone i have seen	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal are your requirements this router do the job	0
and it	1
takes excellent photos	1
there are limitations to what can do with frequency adjustments of the built in speaker crossovers	0
also can store data on it which is a plus want to buy an ipod to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players is	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
this is my first digital camera what a toy it is	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
due to lack of for whs upnp guestnetwork and having dropped the bones i was very unimpressed	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it can t avoid that	0
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
i have this monitor a month now i m very pleased with it	1
this led monitor is fantastic	1
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
having to so much music where ever you go is	1
storage capacity	1
this camera a great feel and weight to it	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
minimal pause songs less than on other devices good achievement a hard drive based player	0
it best on the market	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
i find of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs would give a stars but i m giving because i think do the job people them for	1
to contact their service	1
connection to the device is so easy	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
over for the price this is a good unit	1
first the cons tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
fragile	0
really have over this unit	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s list goes on and on	0
very simple to use	1
people have complained the case having a window but not really a big deal either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
it	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it nt hear a thing	1
i have at the moment does mixing it up	1
very simple to use	1
it has good color and price was great	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
i glad canon keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about quality of this speaker	0
unfortunately can play of the dvd	0
the final insult is while this comes with useful software make printers wirelessly a snap it is only you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
there are limitations to what you do with frequency adjustments because of the crossovers	0
the top that covered the battery poping without the bottom latch	0
recieved this product in works outstanding life screen resolution windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
they deliver sound when hooked up and actually receiving signal	1
canon never fails to amaze	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
but then again the ringer can so loud that i heard ringing when was already out on	1
for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots compared to a component connection	0
the can pop off easily always have mine in the case i did nt notice after first day	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
got system error problem days purchase	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
my is even more pleased due to widescreen	1
machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
have tried to contact apex e mail but the e address is not valid	0
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
but anyway the should at the fact that the phone	1
the other controls all very easy to use	1
i was worried megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working the files	1
the sounds were as the movie intended	1
it has to deliver on quality	1
is very easy to use in fact a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
biggest problem with this speaker is incompatibility with my nd generation ipod	0
the did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted week and a half before started to	0
the d dir n wireless router works as a n wireless router	0
also does voice activated big minus	0
even bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and to use	1
this thing is trash	0
remote capture and fileviewer bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
some movies it yesterday nt play	1
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
bought the gb xtra of weeks and it has been excellent	1
fact is it could nt be easier	1
for what i do use it is perfect	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the software has nt a hassle for at all	1
range to possibly slightly worse than the old linksys i had been for years	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
picture editing software it came with is	0
picture quality	1
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely	1
the interface atrocious several elements simply did nt work at all	0
excellent photos	1
when i turned the phone the first thing that hit is the screen is	0
has with and occasionally if keep trying it will it did not work one time before	0
with it enabled anytime made changes to the router we had to manually press the on radio on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
in an indoor setting are and rarely hazy if you tend	1
could be better designed	0
sound is crystal clear is very deep as	1
will read and play all disc	1
overall a good buy the price	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy nx	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
the lcd larger than the previous model the nx has a bright blue illuminates more than is green backlight did	1
user replaceable battery	1
the only complaint i have is that you in the scroll wheel to select you or it sticks	0
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds though they not damaged in any way	0
the is a very durable compact package and i nikon be a brand that i can trust	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
my two main requirements and lower price i found both	1
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
even better with the headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
portable	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
even though the music is sorted via id tag on the the option search folder is unavailable	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
video output stopped workin	0
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
for those of us that like tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
was dissapointed that nt more helpful	0
scroll easy to use and great for me however many have that the wheel is cumbersome difficult to operate	1
maybe is my lack of experience but found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
best camera ever from the image quality color function i say almost everything	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt after first	1
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
can blame the bad chat support or repair for that because i gave	0
this camera is worth every penny i highly recommend it	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
the explorer program did shut down a times while i renaming titles and changing genres i did nt have to reboot the computer or just open up explorer again	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0

i gave it due to the fact the st one i dropped it from fairly short distance	0

they deliver great sound and actually receiving signal	1
i use with a home theater system and is amazing how the picture clarity is unmatched	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to and use a unit	1

its focusing system is also very flexible	1
getting good value	1
and it does not show no matter what i do	0
the switch negotiated the speed just fine presented the with	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i to bed just to listen my favorite music station the handset itself does weight its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
have nt had time to really player the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
bottom line i a better set of speakers in the creative labs trigue speakers my computer ears rrb for than half the cost	1
the larger screen me to put lrb could nt on the dell rrb edit them	0
a low price comes lower quality	0
p it is lite on weight sad i recommend to there	0

all in all is a very option anyone who has a small portable computer wants a lapdesk and external speakers	0
this little speaker	1
the buttons on the phone small even for my small fingertips but you used to them rather quickly	0
you get much more memory for much less than	1

beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
the d link extreme n router works fine as a n wireless router	1
also i can t why the software does not ignore the lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
it is weight and a good signal strength	1
it does only difficulty playing jpegs it even trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate the noise in a car or on a train	1
however for i think camera is an excellent choice	1
feel cheap is feels like it would break very easily and it definately would survive drop	0
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0

i have it for a week now and this camera my expectations	1
there is no speaker grill offer protection to the driver	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
if you have expectations you will be pleasantly by runs	1
when its fine but i have through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
battery the drawback to most digital cameras to	1
it is so small but big value	1
i m giving this stars as i ve seen of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if headphone jack or problems show up with me too	1
great sound good interface replaceable battery good up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
great camera great investment	1
value gb vs gb ipod the price	0
however to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me the process without a problem	1
by the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings i was able excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1

difficult navigation i wo nt but i do nt the scrollwheel to navigate	0

the sound this slim design puts out	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0

the sound that from that cheap little record player sounded carnegie hall	1

the earbuds so just use	1
so far the router has worked well	1
definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i nt mind buying notmad	0
both the speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
halfway the firmware upgrade bar the infamous page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
typically the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
after we we tried to contact apex but never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is busy do not answer their web customer support	0
i to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
very good range and seemed to be in the horizontal position	1
this camera has a cool feature to find out more log on to canon is website	1
tests showed that the wireless speeds were to of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable as input	1
was forward it even if the other already said it was slow	0
it is so small but big value mac	1
we the finding dvd when we the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
first the zen lets you more than one	1
and with music to your player is incredibly easy	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
the in program id tag editing is as well	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
i been disappointed to find that is no printed with it just a pictorial instruction of installation leaves a great deal of information missing	0
the works very well with	1
the only complaint have is that when you in the scroll wheel to select you to push straight or sticks	0
p fantastic little does everything hoped for work study travel	1
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
battery life is ok	1
what ive read elsewhere the sync at with third party flashes just as it does with dedicated flashes from canon	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
what a junk	0
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp	1
speakerphone	1
paired very easily to	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
the g had problems focusing in low light and not take the picture the was pressed after the shutter had been released a few	0
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
the player itself has sorts of problems	0
some other people who received a lemon came in perfect working condition	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery suggests this company is scrambling to put out fires	0
as i mentioned the mediasource software is actually really robust what others have though notmad may still work better	1
i especially love remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
one bad thing is that comes a mb compactflash most purposes it is not enough	0
bottom line for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
the quality is superb	1
ca nt wrong with these if what you are looking for is in a small package	1
i am not to but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
contrary to what ive elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the team of acer	0
m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
pause songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	0
my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
the phone line responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally your image	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
it does not have an light nice for taking shots it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
but you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
i wo nt go into the details here as go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed picture quality the flexibility automation and the conveniences camera offers	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected that is because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and other programs	0
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
i a player all my dvds and now the player	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
there are lots of interesting features	1
sound also not as high as i would have expected	0
the reason i rated it a four because that darn diopter adjustment dial very small hard you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
only owned it about two weeks so i we re getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at enough at others	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
excellent as well	1
the with auto manual and the very mode which offers like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the build quality is top notch	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
the hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting	0
my first impression was positive	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local desktop portals be able drag drop upload attach	1
t is which does along several long stretches on	1
for those want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
i highly recommend it	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
i love this player and am happy with my decision	1
the picture is amazing and connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning	1
over all very compact camera which us experience a totally new level	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
the main problems for me is that dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
the camera is a dream operate in automode but also gives in aperture priority shutter priority and	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i ve had the nomad	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
the headphones are nt the best you much out of the headphones insert in	0
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
camera for the price can t beat it	0
an player especially for with features that are and even excel the ipod	1
after nearly pictures i have found that nikon takes incredible pictures	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and online at the is login there is a setup wizard work with your os if you	1
seriously this thing everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
on main computer software did not work right	0
anyways back to the point i ve tried be so calm over the past month of dealing acer and their terrible service and support	0
like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
wire runs through the the stand giving it a very clean look	1
works then does not work and you left standing there you are doing something wrong	0
the screen is large and easily read	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom releases the player not been an issue for me and is if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
i guess that lifetime warranty means it take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
kind of and the wheel awkward but i can deal with that	1
forget about if can play some of your real dvds	0
i tried as different formats to see if it would and it did	1
there are limitations to what you can with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
it is and the is decent as well	1
i was for portability and good life and this product delivers both	1
included are awesome and i mention they were polyphonic	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
if want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
it is running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
although the is a little on the features department it is outstanding piece of hardware for doing what was primarily to be a wireless telephone	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
i would be inclined to purchase an apex product again	1
quite simply the firmware and the os control this thing not ready for prime time	0
i purchased nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and is fantastic	1

software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
the nd dvd player which caused to occasionally turn on	0
large and easily read	1
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
only nits i are it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it slow	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
seemed like good deal this pos frequently not and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have sound quality the jbl on stage are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i that feature rrb	1
creative although not as sleek looking is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing files stored on cd dvds	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1

the sound this slim design puts out	1
hours that and could nt connect to the	0

made call which was immediately answered by very helpful competent tech	1
software failed repeatedly	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
if you re looking this is it	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use flash	1
m very happy with these ll probably more for the front	1
does a job in any that	1
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
one good thing is gb of disk space	0

it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
we are pleased with the monitor and	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
sure it had all the features but i to shoot a girl is basketball game it up to the task	0
this is extemely lame	0
is no speaker grill offer any protection	0
for a portable unit this allows listen to share in an setting	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the department	1

it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
proven canon built quality	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction product support of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback problems with the headphone jack	0
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the matrox g dual dvi comes i consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
got it home i discovered that options for sending via either text or email were nt there	0
it small	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
audio is excellent	1
however you crank volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i to get done with some background music viola audio lrb well this is great for a speaker	1

i started accessing files to it to	0
a chance with this new and am pleased in six months it will half of what i paid but that is the price of the art	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
after we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do	0
is too expensive for a usb cable	0
what disappointed me is fact that it does not seem to read certain	0

for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
i love the fact can carry it in my shirt or pocket and forget about it	1
this apex model not work with my universal remote control	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality low light the optical zooms you just closer	1

its silver magnesium finish is stunning the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
for a relatively low price	1
followed in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with if you choose to use it	1
it is such a nice light non intrusive which you can take anywhere	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences only because it lacks and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things you phone to do	0

nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb on the dell rrb and edit them	1
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1

it is made of plastic	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars its	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
surprisingly everything seems to work well	1
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1

you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push a button and it has an screen manual focus mode would be really helpful if shooting that is tough to automatically focus	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
yes there is a corner barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon engineered it that minimize parallax phenomenon that is what exactly ot the picture	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
have better luck but have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
the of the storage size player features makes this player best on the market	1
technical support the buffalo technical support line on the other hand	0
anyway you should really look here is fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
it lighter to carry around and has enough functionality to use	1
is a fun little gadget do nt expect sound	0
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
this phone has a cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
great camera and for the price you t beat it	1
third the poor design continues the case	0
love this player	1
i did not make explorer to work	0
everything was it dropping connection sporadically	0
great sound interface powerful battery good software wake sleep timers multiple play modes	1
the menu options appear at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one or memorized where they in the menu select them by the number keypad	0
good to read	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it	1
and presented the router with a gige link	1
the quality is superb	1
wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the speakers are nice no about it the sound is for the size the range is what you expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even expected rrb	0
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
am savy a computer but is very easy to install and set up	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another value for the money	1
does it and sound seems fine to me	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
quality is	1
it is easy it open to see what song you	1
for part this is a good dvd player	1
joel was nt kidding when he said you more mileage from pair speakers	1
playlists be on the fly computer and you play like your now playing or	1
it is and well worth the price	1
the creative software is not real intuitive	0
unfortunately would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged any way	0
machine will change your whole of what should	1
this system is very powerful	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
highly recommend this monitor to beat at	1
i ve for about weeks and it is best player i ve seen and used ever	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious photography	1
all the buttons neccessary lil gadgets are on of the player which is nice for when you are it in the palm of your hand	1
price gb	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i pleased the performance at the low price these sell for on amazon	0
portable	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the color screen is a plus as are	1
when i it my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
would definatley to friend and its volume can such a small speaker system	1
the is almost completely useless and has worse than without it	0
so sit back relax and to all your friends who paid for a dvd that can t half the things this one can for of the price	1
if you game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout are only so so it does show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you cycle through every zoom setting getting back to normal size	0
when you put this phone in your pocket it there is oh	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
sound quality is good	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage buy the capacity you need for	0
my gut tells me the nomad will in be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one which can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson companies again	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just they would charge the damned	0
once crank the volume a little to bit too for the work i to get done with the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for rrb	1
the sucks	0
my house is small so it hard to judge real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house product perfectly in all rooms corners with no signal interruptions	1
what me is the fact that it does not seem read certain dvds	0
i highly recommend a nokia	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
definitely more capable of the room sound than any other computer speakers i ve	1
i liked the fact you can save custom playlist made on the not just the computer	1
windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer a folder for the nomad	1
i love that is a tablet it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop	1
i enthusiastically this camera	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
also it very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
the menu options are as t see a full screen items to pick from you to scroll up and to what you	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
it the controls are easy to use the battery forever on one single charge the is very user friendly and is beautiful in it casing	1
the and fileviewer software for photo capture is blowing	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
this machine is replacement for your desktop	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service restored when the computer connected directly to the modem rrb	0
one downside though that autofocus does not work well when battery is	0
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
i d tell you my experiences but the router waiting to so i never	0
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
uploading to windows based is very fast and simple	1
quite bulky and uses a heavy although as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
i the and have gotten high quality every time	1
dwl ap does not work as a repeater di s and there no firmware update to this product	1
very good range and seemed to better in horizontal position	1
is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
a	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
what a disappointment	0
the eax mode that the volume the same level for any song in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	0
calling the support number for a week several times a day always got a busy signal	0
so slow it is not useable for files of any size or back	0
it easy remove the plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb user friendly	1
i loved of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
mp optical absolutely that challenges all the above mp cameras to and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least my fiance stamp	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
i bought set and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
they great sound when hooked up actually receiving a signal	1
but this camera is great	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
excellent on par panasonic and jvc players	1
pc cable is expensive for a usb cable	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
i ve the speakerphone for almost hours once battery did not even go down one single bar	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
ripping the even with my connection is still very quick and the quality is	1
zennx is replaceable battery in my purchase over ipod	1
it looks great is loaded with features	1
i have owned this camera for a short time would nt give up for anything	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
it works great	1
shipping was fast are very easy to set up	1
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
we two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and died after less than two weeks	0
is with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
changing is easy with four and i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
this router is awesom but will only you can get more than a open nat type are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried to get it working right but bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
it looks very cool and seems small to me light	0
however has failed to deliver on quality	0
like it is the quickly revised nx boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
good battery life	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no in quality and not using the best possible setting as	0
focusing a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
i still think its a great phone	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
be for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but wait was worth it	0
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers indicated	0
the hard i attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
protective case completely useless as is it display window	0
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending awful product back	0
i and it keeps telling me no disc	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
i used monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and focused text	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
lasted about two weeks before the video out	0
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
i also did nt like it displayed information way down the screen when you in zoom mode	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and network always seems overloaded in very unpleasant calling experience	0
with my sennheiser headphones is loud enough at	1
for the cost this product	1
it does have a lense wo nt let take with it on which real good	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are	1
only if get one camera in it	0
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
a little but otherwise fine	0
the g like a work of art	1
the screen too easily	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
it up for this being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
but about dvd is i a problem when a movie freeze but the dvd still plays eventualy the picture in after skipping a few	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
the pc is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
other tagging result the nomad is operating system	0
is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
speed to the other machines awesome much quicker i replaced combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this a great product	1
good do and	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
this unit was working for the st month and a half and the signal	0
creative are the sound people for computers can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
is no speaker grill to any protection to the driver	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
whether you taking a brisk jog waiting for bus or at you ll be glad the	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in	0
do so more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
this really is a great little phone its got nice and its tiny	1
this player was everything expected to be an affordable multi format dvd player as	1
excellent picture quality on par with pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
great	1
the canon g gives tons for photo but still has an auto that makes it very easy for novice use	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that play almost everything throw at it	0
when the player was working was great but	0
battery life is	0
the reason i am not satisfied with this product the fact it lock at odd times	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
the technical support phone line was responsible my giving technical support stars	1
is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
for me its perfect and the quality is more than acceptable	1
without to through the through the isp taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
others may have better luck but i have never seen with such horrible viewing angles	0
they re pretty comfortable stay place and	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
fortunately the g a hot that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one highest external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely	1
despite minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
chose this one from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the itself is pretty solid	1
as indicated above it has for everyone point and shoot power plus who are	1
it came well packaged	1
not only it the perfect size it all the features a high tech phone would want	1
i ve now had the two months and i m even more pleased with	1

as often the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus you see the lcd is you get	1
transfers	1
multiple play modes tracks in order album shuffle etc is on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not in this matter	0
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and with	0
for the price it is a well investment	1
i was able take great photos the th of july fire works and got some amazing shots the kids playing with	1

i called the tech support and they helped me install new but this did not solve the problem	0

despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1

i highly it	1
cons i think the satellites	0
i tried play song three times with no success	0
i would be inclined to purchase an apex product again	1
a little in the low end	0

great product works for my office	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
the of the call can hear you	1
item shipped out quickly was in good condition came with easy to use up disk have nt had re the router at all so far since it my wife is no longer giving the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop no longer signal well worth the price	1

m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
at first i dealt this as mbps was still really fast	1
when i it only produced with a dvd i got the audio	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome just which is horrible	1
i was surprised to find that not only this dvd player play mpeg which allowed me to stack movies on dvd but it also was able to play vob created with smart ripper	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can activate the speakerphone feature person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
is for me	1
great features	1
this router is phenomenal	1
excellent build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
at ounces is pretty light but as light as the ipod	1
it has lots of cute features my favorite the games and the pim the radio	1
overall the g delivers must be considered current megapixel digicams detail tonal balance and point of view	1
brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum for at night	1
ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to apex dvd and none	0
there is	1
in addition it comes with	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
i it day and i have to charge every or or so	0
it would just spin up and	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
i start off by saying that this hardware is pretty good	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
are beautiful	1
even with the optional headset you can listen to music the integrated	1
was my first nonflip phone and i m glad decided to	1
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb ever size it is rrb power adapter	0
just it up and everything seemed to be	1
for those who want the thump that this capable of very good for this is probably necessary	1
been using g it has proven itself all that it is advertised	1
navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but do nt enjoy scrollwheel	0
i was able take great photos of the th july fire works got some amazing shots of the kids	1
update jan the worked flawlessly the year	1
i know have problems in the and the for the year no asked replacement warranty since creative will only warrant for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would to restart the router then get going again	0
it is exceedingly simple to around in this device	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
one downside though is autofocus does work battery is low	0
its far more difficult select and has easy to use on the fly playlist such as new ipod to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
i it only stars due to the fact that broke when i it from a fairly short distance	0
great	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
c i do love which allows a one click synchronization between the player the music collection on the computer	1
canon is better and believe algorithms are also better	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
great camera	1
no propietary headset jack	0
i ve tried playing and they all play great	1
what a disappointment	0
the scroll wheel finicky it most of the time but is for pressing it just right new say they have success rate some find it that they just return	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers i my front speakers	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
direct firewire the camera	0
another point of note the life incredible	1
overall sounds and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
i m glad to keep the mp resolution and improved upon new technology	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and i am disapointed	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
what do nt like is that at lower volume listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a job up	0
i am impressed how easy this camera is to use	1
does not work properly	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
i have stored around is on this have barely touched the available memory	1
i connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
fact it nt be easier to use	1
my biggest problem with this speaker incompatibility with nd generation nano	0
i complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb it is located in of my basement	1
a rare and valuable	1
loading was somewhat time consuming think it would have with ipod	0
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
is easy enough to for a beginner but it has plenty of for me grow into	1
i disappointed and looking elsewhere for something withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and did job i bought it for admirably	1
creative the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
my other big complaint this monitor is the stand	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips you get used to them rather quickly	0
easy enough to remove the front plate there was only one way could be inserted	1
you playlists songs playlists to your player rip directly from cd to your player	1
is by far in and category i have ever used	1
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
this product is amazing	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the included earpiece very comfortable easy to use	1
the camera has a set of features	1

but if you ve a slr mm camera the controls are intuitive	1

i	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1

this router is the best i have used to date	1
the color screen is plus as are	1
anything this phone does does perfectly	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect the internet	0
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were pages	1
in that model the hard drive just died one before my class	0
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i have not even used my dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
for the price nothing better	1
the are razor sharp even in macro	1
cons i the satellites look ugly	0
seemed like a good deal but pos frequently can recognize and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the backlight makes things easy to see and big for people to see	1
it makes for this by being extremely easy to with well out controls that can be learned quickly	1
the hands free speakerphone is quite powerful	1
enabled anytime we we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
i	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
is an excellent value	1
my only complaint is like others here it disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when does because it does	0
i m very with these i ll probably more for the front channels	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out ll one more	1
am using jbl n ii surround left right which is very nice speaker set	1
i bought this i am very happy with it	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
the scene works well for the remainder of shots not going in a regular setting	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty now	1
but if you re looking my opinion of the apex i love it	1
i quickly got use to the interface and can find fast enough	1

neither message was answered	0
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
however it failed to deliver on quality	0
great phone	1

the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
it is and it has enough functionality to use	1

the theory but upon enabling the guest network working	0
the only two minor issues have with the are the lens cap and the lens itself	0

no matter the format	1
joints excellent black finish and precise speaker hook ups	1
d link support polite tried to help but just worked through a script was unsuccessful	0
anyway this is a great deal and i really love it	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to anyone not looking to spend on speakers	0
that a rare and valuable feature	1
i wished that could make little bit louder	0
i that they could make the volumn little louder	0
you can move the focus range to anywhere in the with the push of a button and it has on screen manual be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
the storage capacity is	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
also while music is previous	1
great speakers overall	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1

door broke after a month	0
well within days the video output quit working	0
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
