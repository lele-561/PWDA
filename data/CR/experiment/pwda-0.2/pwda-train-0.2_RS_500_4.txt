was support tech very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
the experimented with online print ordering and i two major with brick and mortar retailers us they both delivered great results	1
transfering is makes the software easy everythig pretty easy	1
most battery stays charged to a fully time and takes no more than or hours at long for the recharge the via included ac adapter	1
the controls that on the side on the front of instead hold i like because are is where thing is when i which the my thumb	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
small the keypad a decent size but the power on off key is is and difficult to press	0
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
only we if could get one camera in it	0
very user friendly me a to get use to the navigation but it is a few tries took player imo	1
just average an user getting good value in this product	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
well this speaker does the same wonders my ht low end for setup	1
i bought this apex a player because myself at christmas money it got good reviews as a good value for the for on sites variety of different dvd	1
while upgrading the keyboard connector the memory broke	0
although it player seems in addition work if you re about five feet only from the away to that that have been just the batteries may came with it	1

if you do can artist tags all of your tracks and lump it not the same directory ll they nt into be searched via have or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
the second set is just working fine	1
if they were to do these speakers on because i would give i stars but i m giving my listening needs a think i rate the job that most people want them for	0
the is button enough overly sensitive at times not sensitive scroll at others	0
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
the nx successfully larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more the lcd backlight is is green than did	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
this machine a will your whole idea of what change laptop should be	1
the software the i found is quick easy to use entire process very easily mastered	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
the headphone earbuds are just so instead use your regular pair average	1
recommend this minor disappointment i highly who the canon g anyone despite is serious about digital photography	0
amazon was wonderful about up paying picking the next day and shipping for the return it	1
support service the quality their customer are overloaded and nonresponsive tells and about you of their products and technical willingness to stand behind them	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
all in all has for a very good option is anyone who this a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	0
and it too great works	1
with for of storage i the player about songs on have with room gb about more	1
well the theory was great things upon enabling the guest network but stopped working	0
ve i it already emailed creative tech support about they and gotten timely responses but will fix it for me if necessary	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
i again expect reviewers to go bad fully in the same or some other way in the next months as because other is have pointed out the construction it pretty flimsy	0
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
and after of construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment the the stainless steel heft body the s	0
storage capacity	1
range good speed	1
capacity storage	1
thanks to amazon is amazing return policy i was no to return the product at able loss on my part	1
of stand through the body wire the runs giving it a very clean look	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
in short if that and just want you you a little afraid just and is of technology get a router to someone online do basic networking and play mafiawars re browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the in is i d tag program editing a strong point as well	1
for the nothing there is price better	1

to i hooked it up and everything seemed just be going fine	1
i did nt abuse it i charged every it day but jack headphone sort just the of fizzled out	0
sound best in class	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
so you you re game for with if may be very pleased a little fiddling this day forecaster	1
computer the player can your connect stream and you to listen to your stored mp s as they open up mediasource directly from the xtra	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog to a dropped internet connection it the point where i was having to reset it my and computer to in order far too often reclaim down	0
