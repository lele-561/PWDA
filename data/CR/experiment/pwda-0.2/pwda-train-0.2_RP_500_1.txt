besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
it is another great misfortune that my laptop i use to operate crashes frequently and my music player set up does nt work with it s the list goes on and on	0
i have not had time to really push this player to the limit but i think the results on the field are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
nothing but love	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
the nikon coolpix is one of the best cameras to use high quality and compact in size	1
it has good color and price was great	1
great quality picture and features	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my computer	1
i had no problems setting up the software and now my favorite cd is back	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
they were both good	1
great camera	1
the link does not work properly	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1

small size	1

the only thing i do not like about this is the cover art	0
then my dvds would either be playing in the middle or not even be playing at all	0
i am ripping my mp files into mp and wma files this gives an idea of what i can do good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen better than the nx is able to	1
it looks great and it works	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
even viewed in a folder full of jpgs	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
very easy to set up	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
i get to the door and everything freezes	0
a lot of a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
this is a toy and what a toy it is	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1

it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
the build quality is top notch	1
i nt play a lot of discs	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
but he never fails to amaze	1
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the appearance is okayed	1
the ability to maintain crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles and angles	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
this is a great deal for you and it is worth every penny	1
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
so now it just plays everything you just can t play	0
it also does nt have the option of dialing big minus	0
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
this is especially useful if you have a lot of children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them while they are playing	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and well worth it	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the user interface and settings are easy use	1

great quality picture and sound	1
featured image	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always use it so i did nt worry about it after all	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
the truth is that the fastest speed that has ever been measured has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
update the finish is a bit different and i like it	1
the sound quality of the audio is so bad that it is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
if you do nt do this it ll lump all of your tracks into the same file and they can not be searched for as the search engine does not know the difference	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the camera ready to shoot i was able to produce a lot of stopaction photos contrary to what i was expecting	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
apex ad runs on dvd r rw and dvdr rw including dvd re rw	1
this is the best phone i have seen	1

the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
it may	1
in this system the zen xtra uses i tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
would definatley be a great addition to your home and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
great minds	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
i have excellent hearing but the speaker on this phone is especially quiet	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1

this phone is a winner	1
it will read and play the entire all cd audio disc	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
when you put this thing in your pocket you forget it is there it is so small and oh so light	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
no games it has a lot of power so why not use it	0
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
the scroll button is a little too sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
material is on the cheap side	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
software the software is crap	0
the results are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
your comments are great	1
turning to the camera	1
takes excellent photos	1
while the differences are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the number of mp s with each zoom setting and you must go through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
its out of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
i did not think the eq would do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
this product is definitely worth a try	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you cant go wrong	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the companys telephone number is always busy and they do not answer our calls	0
because this camera is beautiful	1
i selected the right away and have gotten a new set of pictures every time	1
on the other hand indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as outdoor shots	0
i can t rate it higher only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
this phone has many other features but just to name one the features above i view as the best	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
the woofer	0
i am quite happy with it	1
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
i would love to share with you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1

the router connected to all my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	0
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is amazing	1
in addition it may mean	1

the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
creative labs customer support website is available here	1
the second set is working just fine	1
price gb of storage	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
its fine	1
there is also no height adjustability so it has to be very low to the desk	0
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
this is a winner	1
however it has the potential to deliver on quality	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
please make a plugin that enables all the usb drives attached to this site to be able to be accessed in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be ableto drag and drop files upload attach etc	1
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
my first impression was positive	1

this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1

the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0

it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with the addition of new earphones and software	1

this really is a great phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great battery life and its cheap	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a sturdy and sturdy feel	1
i fully expect it to be bad again in the same or similar way to the first one because as many people have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0

they do look cool in the dark though	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends and family who are willing to pay a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do all the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0

now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it doesnt work the next day	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0

this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny	1

as a non tech savvy person i was surprised to install the cisco valet wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is not loud enough at	0
how this apex dvd player turned out great	1
while i like the design of the phone in every regard i would not recommend buying another one solely upon the looks or indestructibility of it	1
no changes to the format	0
does what it should and the sound is fine too	1
and it is	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are great	1
it may	1
video output format	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
all the latest sports stuff is top notch	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
what really made this a great mp player for me was the software	1
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which is nt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
i like it is color better but it is not perfect	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
this is wonderful to have for your own dvd collection	1
i gave the zen class because it is the best class for me but i feel that it is subjective and it is not really appropriate to judge it based on players in a different class	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
however shareport on this new router worked fine	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
navigation is easy and i found that syncing my photos from my phone to the computer was easy too	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i love the system with it	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
bottom line is for the price you pay they sound great and have tons of good bass	1
i am using them in my office and they generally work well	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
the other player is fine	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
great price for all the features	1
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up does nt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
not only is it functional and runs super fast it also has a great design but it is also eye candy	1
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
i think i like it	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
i am very happy with this phone and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
i need this monitor	0
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing music you want or you can set the interface as modern or old	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
it would look great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
not plug play or play on id no fm or recording	0
i bought this stuff for just and there is no limit to what i can do with it	1
i have attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a variety of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the unit	0
the software i am using can not work on my pc	0
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
it had a heavier and more durable plastic casing	0
the monitors were both good	1
sound quality is good	1
i have had this thing just over a year now and the headphone jack has never once come loose	1
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
in the meantime if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want to be able to get online do basic things and not have to worry about mafiawars and malware all day this router is great for you	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
color and contrast are perfect for my needs	1
the function lever the one which switches between the two	0
i did a ton of research and found a lot of value on this phone because of the great speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
whether you are taking a walk or a jog or waiting for a bus or just having a picnic at the park you will be glad you had the fm radio	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below average	0
i bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
the ipod nano is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
it has all the features that you would need in a cellphone	1
you can thank me or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
it makes up for this by being very easy to use with a very well laid out interface that can be learned quickly	1
operating its many features is not easy i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at home	1
very long lasting battery life	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
it is worth it	1
it is small enough to fit in my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
fm says it has none	0
both units are equipped with similarly small speakers	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
the operation with the increased memory option was not possible with the windows home professional instaled otherwise the operation with windows starter was possible and nobody complained	0
they have a pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio experience	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
the only disadvantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace the cheap user replaceable battery is not available	1
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear images	1
the remote is a little hard to find	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
the scene mode will work well for the remainder of the players that are not going to be in the game	1
it has been	1
the user interface the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
great sound very long battery life very fast battery life great battery life removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
overall i lira	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable type	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex court	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
even the bass is a little weak from such rather small drivers	0
it is slightly lighter than the previous model and packed with a few more features	1
you can stop looking this is the only router you will find on lrb i am writing this on my laptop	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
games kind of stink and you know you have to get the game in order to get additional games	0
the service is great i do nt have any complaints about it and the only thing that i miss from my is voice mail	1
i did nt read a word of it it was just intuitive	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through monitors now and its still not working	0
i like the fact that i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
color and contrast are perfect for this	1
and if you do well there is no complaints about that	1
when you turn it off it turns on really fast and the music starts to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
we own two sets of these in our home and i am very pleased with the performance of these especially at the low price these sell for on ebay	1
well this is a great idea and does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works well	1
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is very good once you have it set up and configured	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
overall rating	1
worked fine	1
the size is small	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
you can be up to about a thousand miles away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
also the head cap design is flawed	0
this is the best i have seen	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to respond to two messages	0
meanwhile the instructions for apple users say i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only works on mac computers and offered nothing by way of explanation on how to do it for apple computers	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
the appearance is similar	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
what i do nt want to say is that my music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
the headphones are great but you can really expect much out of the pair of headphones you insert into them	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
all in all this is a great player that blows the i feel away with easy to use and easy to learn features software that is very intuitive and a great sound	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
minimal pause between songs is better than that on other devices and is ideal for a hard drive based player	1
many of our disney movies do nt play well on this dvd player	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
well at first it was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
one good thing it did	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
i play them at a pretty low volume and at low volume they sound a little weak and since i am in an apartment i normally dont listen to them	0
i love you and it has lasted	1
this is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
small print	1
at the end of the day what i wanted was a device which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is a great example of a device that with its design and features easily	1
i will have to see if i agree with others here about the character of this speaker	0
it is versatile and seems to be the best of the lot	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that you do not automatically play one after another in the same game	0
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
this router is phenomenal	1
key instead	0
i would strongly recommend this product	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
the other apps are all very easy to use	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
my stress level is ok	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three rooms in my house lrb unit is very easy to use and easy in the setup and security aspects	1
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious users will appreciate so it is a good tool to grow into	1
be prepared for a long wait it took about minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
the on off button is somewhat flimsy and has an extremely tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the light	0
great product works perfectly for my office	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
but for what i do use it is great	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
it sucks	0
i purchased three of these at the same time from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
the only bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is useless	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
the door would not close	0
the zen file system but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be saved or programs to be opened	0
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
this apex court system will not work with my universal birth control	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could not play all my dvds and now the player can t play them either	0
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell to it	0
you can see all of them in the view finder	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
i bought this for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling trip	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
the button is finicky it is not hard to press but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have a very low satisfaction rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
good luck	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
as i mentioned before the creative writing software is actually really robust compared to what some people have said though not perfect it could still work better	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
i tried to fix it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for it to work	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
my first impression	1
video output stopped workin	0
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
one other plus is that napster now works with this device via bluetooth	0
trumps support from congress is literally nonexistent	0
then sorting the data is easy as pie	1
the customer support is very rude	0
its size which might not seem to matter except if you are going to use it while driving or keep it in your pocket	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a good grip	0
a great deal for a relatively low price	1
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a great user experience	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it has a nice color screen	1
the quality is excellent	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and strain my ears when i am trying to read something that i thought i had to do with my eyes	1
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
simple click on the back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
the volume range is great so you can hear everything	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like some of the other android phones	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit weird in comparison to standard rectangular layout of the keyboard but it is not too weird	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
do nt buy this player	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is very well written	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
i think this is perfect although i m not watching on tv thanks	1
price along with the quality of the battery were the most important factors on why i picked the nomad	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
the moveable lcd screen	1
after nearly years i have found that my camera takes incredible pictures	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
sub woofer is large	1
the woofer is much larger	1
unfortunately it turns out to be the disposable kind	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
i have yet to try using all the different modes like shutter priority aperature priority light priority aperture priority etc but all of them are well thought out and and the manual is very clear	1
very easy to set up	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
the dvd player is fine	1
for me its perfect and the quality for docs and word docs is more than good enough	1
portable	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will let you down	0
storage capacity	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
the lack of capacity is great for me	0
but i think the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have a headphone jack	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the button it doesnt want to move so you have to push straight in or it wont work	0
it really impressed me with the design and the specs the price	1
it is always a good idea to pop it open to see what music you re listening to	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you can throw at it	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
i got it today it is a great tower for its sound quality and price i do nt think that the volume control for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed together to get the better sound	0
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb was out of stock and the box with the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
for those who want the fact that this is capable of producing lrb very well for a computer speaker rrb this is not a problem	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
picture quality is excellent	1
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and quiet	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as it could be	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
i was surprised to find that not only could it play mpeg format which allowed me to watch movies on my computer but it also was able to play the vob files which i created with smart ripper and the mpeg files	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited amount of viewing angles in the picture and it is difficult to get consistent contrast	0
one of the main things i am not happy with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times it is annoying	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
this dvd play is basicly disabled	0
the problem is large	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed to out of the box	0
playlists can be made on the radio without a playlist manager and you can use play modes to search for your now playing selections or playlists	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are amazing and you can see the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the quality of the service is sub par	0
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
this wonderful product was created	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the great features that a great game has and if you get if from us your only going to pay for this great player	1
very long lasting effect on life	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
the possibilities with the manual and the new scene mode which offers optimized situational settings such as portrait landscape beach or sunset etc are endless	1
there are a lot of features included such as eax and customization	1
overall an excellent phone	1
key words	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
it is smaller than i thought it would be when i made it but as it turns out so much better	1
the world is crap	0
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
however i do nt want to do this because the clip can get loose and the case can slip off	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no confusion	1
seriously i am	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
i have just purchased the canon powershot for the first time and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
with gb of space i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
the phone is sound quality is great i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
as a portable player it should also be a bit more durable	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the cost of storage	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
the auto setting does a pretty good job most of the time but there are manual settings available for those who want them	1
the sound quality is really good	1
i m not very happy with it	0
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
they do look pretty good in the dark though	0
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
the camera has a different type of charging system from the other canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system on this camera allows you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
the creative editor is awkward difficult to use and just plain unreadable and does nt load on some computers	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the stock is on the cheap side	0
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen lit up and looked wonderful	1
i could not connect and would not connect at wireless n speeds	0
it took a while from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
rrb today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home i cant due to heavy snow	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
it has lots of great things my favorite being the games and the music and the radio	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
i wo nt go into the details here as the online sites go into great depth in their reviews but i am very pleased with the features the speed the picture quality the flexibility the automation and the functional conveniences this camera offers	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
it is tall so i can pick it up and turn it on its side	0
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am not a fan	0
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
sound great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
