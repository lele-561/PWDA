i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1

this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0

overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
overall an excellent phone	1
software the software is crap	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1

for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1

it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0

this router is phenomenal	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1

i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0

in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
i thought it was just the player but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex is actually ruining my media	0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0

unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1

second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
