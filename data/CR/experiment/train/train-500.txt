no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
honestly i love this player	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
do nt buy this player	0
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
very good value for the money	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
nice little phone light compact	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
so far the router has worked well	1
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
very bad quality	0
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
technical support line the buffalo technical support line on the other hand was very helpful	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
avoid this model like the plague	0
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
best in class sound	1
software the software is crap	0
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
the software failed repeatedly	0
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
storage capacity	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
great quality picture and features	1
other than that this thing is great	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
sound quality is good	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
the player usually plays dvd is but has occasional problems such as not recognizing a dvd stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	0
so if you re game for a little fiddling you may be very pleased with this day forecaster	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail but the e mail address is not valid	0
i tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
this router is the best i have used to date	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
this thing is trash	0
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
d link support was polite and tried to help but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful	0
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house that one didn t work either	0
the phone is sound quality is great i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls very well at all	0
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
overall a sweet machine	1
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
the sound quality is very exceptable	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
screen brightness is really good	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
folders cannot be created for the audio files	0
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
only if we could get one camera in it	0
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
the monitors were both good	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
speakerphone	1
awesome sound system	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
the volume	0
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
the picturers are amazing	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
the fm radio is cool	1
it is crystal clear	1
the size is small	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
there is an alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
great colors pictures and white balance	1
color screen is good	1
i really love this netbook	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
but this camera is great	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
office starter web cam is also fairly good light in weight and elegant cons i wo nt say anything bad as you are just paying for this net book	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
worked fine	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
it works great	1
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
even with these shortcomings i still think it is the best digital camera available under	1
i find it too bright	0
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
it is easy	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
after i had it a couple weeks it got into a state where it could never find the device no matter how often i rebooted my pc reset the device reloaded drivers etc etc creative is online support was no help at all	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
takes excellent photos	1
loved the slim design	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
died very shortly after getting them	0
great picture	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
also i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp cds	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed	0
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
delivery was prompt	1
this is the best phone i have seen	1
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
nice and compact	1
the customer support is very rude	0
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
this phone is a winner	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
it is worth it	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
great camera great investment	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
convenience because it works through the usb port	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
after using it for about a month i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
main dial is not backlit	0
overall an excellent phone	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
this router is phenomenal	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
overall i like the system features and performance	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
the memory is staggering	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
the woofer is much larger	1
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
key instead	0
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
