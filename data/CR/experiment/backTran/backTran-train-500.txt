in the end i felt that the lrb speakers i got were overpriced unless there were some inherent rrb benefits in the bose label that i wasnt aware of	1
another point worth noting is that the battery life is incredible	1
i once used the speakers for nearly two hours and the battery didnt even drop a bar	1
i give this player a cautious recommendation	1
last night i needed to reset the router	0
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle and wouldnt even be read at all	0
this is a superb camera and good value for money	1
when the player was working it was great but	0
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
ive been ripping songs with it for the past few weeks and its ease of use has been excellent	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly	1
heck its easy to go online and tweak it there	1

its transparent	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
i just like the feature	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
another good thing is that the unit has both optical and coaxial digital audio output although the latter is not mentioned in the literature that i scanned before buying	1
by holding the shutter halfway down and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to take excellent stop motion shots that differed from other reviewers	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
they make great sound when connected and actually receive a signal	1

i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
nice and compact	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1

the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
the manual does a good job of filling in any gaps	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1

just an average user getting good value in this product	1
cons i think the satellite looks ugly	0
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
do nt buy this monitor	0
i think its great from a technical point of view and the addition of the speakers makes it even better and i love the phone	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the case was too small and it took me half an hour to fit the behemoth into the cage	0
i get complete coverage in my house which is located in the corner of my basement	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
overall the nikon is a very reliable durable and practical small camera	1
fragile	0
i followed the simple instructions in the manual and once logged in on the router a setup wizard appears that will work with your operating system if you choose to use it	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
the camera is affordable simple and easy to learn and the images taken are spectacular	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
this thing is trash	0
the included headphones are very comfortable and easy to use	1
works super easy	1
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1

this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
if youre traveling around the world this is a very functional phone	1
i was in awe of this canon camera which is available in g	1
the tenor isnt the best but its certainly there enough to satisfy anyone who isnt going to spend money on a computer speaker	0
the software on the router is pretty good	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
the device itself is very sturdy	1
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
only if we could get one camera in it	0
i love the storage space inside here	1
excellent range of metering options as well	1
value comparison of data storage versus price	1
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks and the ease of use is wonderful	1
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
the very intuitive menu is a big plus for this camera	1
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
the fact that this model can play jpeg slides is a big plus for me as a visual artist and i stumbled upon the fact that it can play mpeg files from regular cd r data drives without the need for vcd format	1
finally making playlists from computers can be complicated as tracks are listed individually and organized by cds which are not listed but organized alphabetically	0
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
there are no signal loss issues unlike the netgear router it replaces which only lasted a few months	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
like other reviewers installation was hell	0
the volume range is wide so you can blow it up if you want	1
the lens cap design is also flawed	0
there are many other features in this phone and this is just one of the features above that i find most beneficial	1
my only complaint is that when you press down on the roller to select you have to press straight down or it gets stuck	0
but to me its perfect	1
the manual is easy to understand and it is mostly idiot proof	1
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
having an id tag that is not filled in will result in music being potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
since it wouldnt work as advertised i called support	0
a few days later the video output stopped working	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired nvidia glasses	1
the picture is perfect although i m not watching on an hdtv	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
i bought the phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
they can be more comfortable but there are no complaints in the sound department	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
convenient because it works via a usb port	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be better	0
the connection to the device is very simple	1
now one more complaint i have about the g is the software that comes with it for handling raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i do is replace mbyte cf with mbyte cf which gives me raw images instead of	0
this top of the line dvd player is great	1
the pc syncing feature in the nokia pc suite software is excellent	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
however creative software is not really intuitive	0
i love this monitor	1
difficult navigation i wouldnt necessarily say difficult but i dont like navigating with rollers	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
i love the quality of the photos	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works well	1
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
for years carriers expensive plans and horrendous customer service portability seemed like a godsend	0
i dont have any problems with this product	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
i highly recommend this product	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
the player usually plays dvds but occasionally has problems such as not recognizing the dvd stopping play at certain points in the movie each time it plays and not being able to access certain special features on rental dvds	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
battery life was good though i recommend two rechargeable batteries or an alkaline backup battery for emergencies	1
oh and the screen saver is cute	1
the dvd player does not work properly	0
this monitor is highly recommended and unbeatable at this price point	1
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
the camera is constantly autofocused in auto mode accompanied by a buzzing sound that cant be stopped	0
when the computer connected directly to the modem rrb the lrbs lost internet connection to the router was restored to internet service	0
this software sucks	0
unfortunately i bought a player because ps cant play all my dvds and now the player cant play everything	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or to protect it against any damage	1
even if the default settings are left in place they produce clear playback	1
worked fine	1
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
it was easy to set up and both my ps asus eee netbook droid and pc connected smoothly	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and within minutes i had all my wireless devices lrb laptop desktop and smartphone rrbs connected to the internet	1
but anyway what you should really notice is that the phone has voice dialing	1
the problem was that the fastest anything could connect to it even in the same room was only about megabits	0
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
but i have played it on dvd and had problems watching movies the picture would freeze but the dvd would still play and eventually the picture would recover a few minutes after skipping	0
unfortunately the player wont read any of my area dvds even if they arent damaged in any way	0
anyway the price wont be a problem	1
seems to be able to read most dvds very well and read them in silence	1
this software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box im out listening to any of my cds	1
screen brightness is really good	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i could tell there was a big difference in contrast brightness and viewing angles between this monitor and the dell ultrasharp	1
not enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
sometimes the system would hang so i had to reboot the router and run it again	0
longer battery life greater access to online music services and pc compatibility are among its sensitivities	1
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
if you tend to take pictures from a distance shots taken indoors will be a little dull and rarely blurry	0
for the price of this product i couldnt ask for more	1
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
the sound quality and fundamentals are amazing	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
the prints are beautiful	1
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
the included earplugs werent so bad	1
the display is clear and bright and works very well	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in the basement of four bars all the time	1
silver really adds a special touch	1
the replaceable battery is great because once it finally runs out you will be able to easily purchase another one	1
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
we are very happy with the squad leader and the company	1
its small and lightweight looks nice and has a decent display	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get through immediately no more waiting and at least my imac and macbook are back online	1
unless we can fit a camera in it	0
my only complaint so far is that it dropped the security settings once i dont know why not know if it was me doing something or the router malfunctioning	0
it was bulky and used a heavy battery though not very sturdy as it was mostly made of plastic	0
however i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off	0
the bottom line does a good job of making the camera easy to use with very flexible and powerful features including the ability to use an external flash and a choice of lens filters	1
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
lrb yes just like you will be using a new very expensive dsl modem as a matte bridge rrb i returned the merchandise and got a linksys dsl modem	0
p it is not lite on weight so sad i definately recommend it to anyone out there	0
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
i love this player and am very happy with my decision	1
the rover setup process is annoying and the interface with the player is terrible	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store tons of songs on this	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
the monitors were both good	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
batteries are good	1
you can stop looking for the best n router you can find today	1
i found apex advertising to be a good deal	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be grainy but onfull size high to fine quality the zoomed images are quite impressive	1
be very happy with the monitor and the price	1
you certainly have some great customization options as well	1
also i had no problems reading the svcds and vbr mp cds i made	1
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
great phone	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
the grain was terrible	0
when i connect the device to my computer about of the time it cant find the device	0
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
with gb of storage i was able to play about songs on the player with room for more	1
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight that illuminates the screen better than the nxs green backlight	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
it doesnt look good spending that much money and of course you want something aesthetic	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
because other people who complain about this player are talking rubbish this player is so good his break is so fast its horrible	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
pc cables are too expensive for usb cables	0
bottom line great product unbeatable price	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
due to lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just abandoned the framework of this router im not impressed	0
as i mentioned before the creative media source software is actually very powerful despite what anyone says although notmad might still work better	1
but canon never surprises	1
this manual is easy to understand and is basically for dummies	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
i hooked it up to my latest macbook pro and it worked perfectly	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or protect it from any damage	1
setup software for my application i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless	0
when i turn on the phone the first thing i think about is how good the screen is	1
the software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box i was out and about listening to any one of my cds	1
yes there is a corner barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you dont zoom canon knows this and designed it this way to minimize parallax phenomenon which is pretty much how photos really are	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
the design and construction is excellent as is the quality of nikon optics legendaries	1
the eax features are really cool and creative including some eq tweaks such as compensating for exotic noises encountered in cars or trains	1
the prints are beautiful	1
another problem is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
ive tried playing all of these discs and they all play well	1
when trying to get service from apex nothing the situation was the same as everyone else	0
the canon g is probably the best mp camera out there	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
the body structure in general has quite a bit of plastic in it and in s	0
it does have a lense cap but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
the speed is too slow to use for files or backups of any size	0
i am ripping up my cd collection into kbps wma files so that on average each cd has about mb of space which is equivalent to me having about mb of free memory	1
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
the speakers performed extremely well and the sound was filled in very well with enhanced bass	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
ill tell you about my own experience but the router waited to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try	0
for me its perfect and the quality of games and word documents is excellent	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
the controls were harder to use than ipods but i got used to them and didnt even think the huge difference in price was justified at first	0
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
sure it has all the features but when im trying to film a girls basketball game its just trying to get the job done	0
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
i particularly like the remote holder which has the big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
i didnt manage to make the creative nomadic explorer work	0
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
overall i would recommend these to anyone who wants a small yet effective set of computer speakers for a reasonable price	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
it works well	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the text is big enough for people to see	1
software the software is crap	0
its easy but it doesnt work	0
in short its cheaper than an ipod and in my opinion a better choice	1
for price and features its certainly good	1
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
good range speed	1
small size	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
very good range and seems better in horizontal positions	1
less than a month later the screen froze and eventually showed no cd	0
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
the first one we installed didnt work and our kids were devastated	0
valet plus is easy to configure and set in about minutes	1
i get to chapter and everything freezes	0
apex tech support is almost non existent	0
as a non technical person i was surprised to install the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot in less than minutes	1
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
navigating many of its features is easy and often obvious im no anne lebovitz but i was able to guess most of its features just by playing around in a camera store	1
these two problems the dvd will freeze repeatedly during playback while the counter on the player keeps working	0
it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
the sounds fit with the intent of the films director	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
the gs battery charging system differs from smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged in the camera but the charging system also allows you to use the camera when plugged in without draining the battery	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
thanks to amazons amazing return policy i was able to return it without a loss	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
its great when the players are working but	0
id tag editing in the program is also a plus	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
the players themselves have all sorts of issues	0
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
i chose this one because from my perspective its the best deal	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a laptop and external speakers	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
on my main computer the software doesnt work properly	0
this camera is as close to perfect as any other digital camera is to megapixels	1
the standard battery that comes with the g is a camcorder battery that allows me to take pictures all day without worrying about recharging	1
my favorite is nomads eax feature	1
as the reviews say they sound really good	1
it also costs a lot less than an ipod	1
i really dont have any complaints about this unit	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
without a doubt i would say that the sound quality of these speakers is on par with the jbl on stage and is truly portable lrb that can play without an electrical outlet a feature i love	1
i was disappointed that acer didnt do more to help	0
great colors pictures and white balance	1
after several attempts one of the disks was eventually recognized but the video quality was poor and the functionality was not available	0
customer service staff are very rude	0
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
many of our disney movies wont play on this dvd player	0
the keyboard was also very good and very comfortable although it took some getting used to	1
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
upon opening them i found them to be really small but felt solid	1
still priced below the lowest level of ipods i was able to get this gb monster and the best part was that it worked because it was so big for advertising and then some	1
this model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned	0
for price size and features you cant beat this	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
this grain sucks	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
repeated software failures	0
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
the volume	0
excellent color display with clear images and just the right size for my desk	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0

the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1

the other controls are incredibly easy to use	1

there is always a bit of noise in filmed film editing and there is no avoiding that	0

easy enough but it did not work	0
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
it had a few inconveniences one being that songs didnt auto play like a cd one after another	0
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
ive had no problems at all so far and im happy	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked fantastic	1
when it works its fine but ive used two monitors and now both have trouble switches	0
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
creative is the best candidate for a computer i dont understand why the eax introduces static electricity	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
not only did it have trouble playing jpegs files it even had trouble playing dvd movies	0
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
please do a firmware upgrade to make all usb drives connected to this wireless router visible in the desktop portal of your local computer that is actually networked and able to drag and drop upload attachments etc	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
even in the most extreme viewing angles contrast sharpness and readability are unbeatable	1
this camera is great for operating in automatic mode and is also very flexible in aperture priority shutter priority and manual mode	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
storage capacity	1
the browser program did close a few times when i renamed the title and changed the type but i didnt have to reboot the computer or do anything just open the browser again	0
uploading pictures to my windows computer is quick and easy	1
dont buy this player	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect fast as hell in music transfer controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound and ive heard many mp players a ton of different equilizer type deals on here	1
awesome camera with great print quality in a small package	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to quickly navigate menus	1
but when we used it again there was sound but no image	0
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
i get to chapter two and everything freezes	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
the keyboard connector is damaged while upgrading the memory	0
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
the larger screen allows me to put all my photos on it instead of on the dells screen and edit them	1
i like this monitor	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
ease of use many reviews mention this	1
i found the phones lack of entertaining games very disturbing	0
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
i recently purchased a canon powershot g and am very pleased with the purchase	1
these speakers are great	1
it also has great coverage through our two story house	1
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
for my grandmother its easy to use	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
it does have a lens cap but it wont let you take really good pictures with it	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
im so happy with these that id probably buy more for the front channels	1
the software on the router is good	1
megapixel is plenty for anyone and the photo quality is fantastic	1
that cheap little record player makes a sound like carnegie hall	1
the g has trouble focusing in low light and wont take pictures when the shutter is pressed but will take pictures a few seconds after the shutter is released	0
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
this fantastic product is easy to unbox and install	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
great sound very long battery life very fast charging rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
as a non technical person i was surprised that the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot was installed in less than a few minutes	1
bottom line great products at unbeatable prices	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
my main reason for not being happy with this product however is that it locks up at odd times	0
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
the overall image quality is poor when the screen shrinks or malfunctions	0
also for some reason the image looks faded on the s video compared to the component connection with a lot of oozing color	0
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
headphones arent the best but you really get a lot out of the little headphones you plug into your ear cavity	0
navigation system zen xtra uses id tags embedded in mp files to organize your songs	0
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
all in all this is another excellent creative product	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
price	1
in my opinion the size and design of the system is fantastic and looks even better than ipods	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
the system is very powerful	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer was easy too	1
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
it sounded great in the yard or on my nightstand	1
the sound settings can be adjusted to suit personal preferences	1
i couldnt be happier that i bought this camera	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
some people have a problem with the flip switch that releases the player cover at the bottom which isnt a problem for me and it doesnt matter if you use the cover switch	1
maybe its my lack of experience but i find the pictures taken with this camera very disappointing	0
the typical problem for me and for many others is the headphone jack	0
this router is the best i have used to date	1
i have returned my ad to apex because it cannot play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera canon put enormous quality into the g	1
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
it works fine we just plug it in	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
the problem came from my video card	0
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
so now it still plays everything you cant see	0
the photos are very sharp even in macro	1
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
i bought the canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
one piece of good news is that it has gb of disk space	1
i dont think it really matters though i mean my xbox was connected to a standard vga port a while ago and the picture was great	1
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get connected right away and do nt have to wait rrb and got at least my imac and macbook back online	1
although i didnt watch it on a high definition tv the picture was perfect	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
my only complaint is the sound quality	0
value comparing data storage with price	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
i wont go into the details here as the website reviews are already deep enough but i was very pleased with the cameras features speed picture quality flexibility automation and functional convenience	1
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
poor visibility on the keys	0
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
it was chosen because it looks easy to install	1
its back working and im glad the rumours i heard about acer tech support didnt turn out to be true in my case	1
the day finally came when i knew for sure i wanted to leave sprint	0
when i hooked it up it only produced sound and the cd played well but the dvd only had sound and no image	0
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
