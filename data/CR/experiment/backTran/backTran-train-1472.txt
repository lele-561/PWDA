my dwl ap does not work as a repeater for di s and there is no firmware update to support this product	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me there is no disc	0
but canon never surprises	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the for the year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for days which in itself is totally ridiculous	0
pictures wont transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	0
netbooks are a breeze for my sales people it runs fast with the extra ram theres nothing to stop it in fact its better than my own laptop so ill switch to this as soon as possible	1
when it works its fine but ive used two monitors and now both have trouble switches	0
im using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
my only complaint is the sound quality	0
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
i was very pleased with the router	1
they are not wowable good	0
bottom line i have a better set of speakers in the creative labs i trigue speakers on my computer lrb at least to my ears rrb for less than half the cost	1
scroll button switch	0
overall the nikon is a very dependable robust and useful little camera	1
so sit back and relax and brag to all your friends who paid a fortune for a dvd player and cant do half the things this one does for a fraction of the price	1
and it works great too	1
working on the shuffle for a few hours with it is simply fantastic	1
connect to d link extreme n connection speed down to mbps and wireless connection speed down to mbps	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving the photos were awesome	1
all the latest acer stuff is top notch	1
nice little phone light compact	1
the data rate over the network storage is rather slow but i only use it for occasional backups so it does nt bother me too much	0
i think its great from a technical point of view and the addition of the speakers makes it even better and i love the phone	1
since mediasource is so simple i found the bundled nomad explorer software useless	0
i had no problem setting up the software and getting my favorite cd to be transferred	1
the device itself is pretty solid	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers	1
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
i spent hours on that and i could nt connect to the internet	0
remote you can stand it on end and it is far better designed than the s	1
the function stick that switches between shooting and viewing modes feels flimsy	0
the software is great as long as you have an admin user account	1
but with a low price comes lower quality	0
you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	0
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd	0
i tried navigating to past chapters through the menu but it didnt work	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
even the slightest wobble can completely distort your image	0
pressing the scroll button does not always respond	0
i spent hours on the phone with their tech support lrb you get through immediately no more waiting and at least my imac and macbook are back online	1
sounds like nothing to complain about	1
there was nothing wrong with my phone	1
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
it is small unlike my canon slr so it easily fits in my pocket	1
it was bulky and used a heavy battery though not very sturdy as it was mostly made of plastic	0
with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
you can create playlists drag drop songs and playlists to your player and rip directly from cd to your player	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in a usb powered drive and have network accessible storage	1
it works great	1
this camera is as close to perfect as any other digital camera is to megapixels	1
this product is definitely worth the purchase	1
in any case navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	0
now i have it but i cant imagine not having it	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
i love this player and am very happy with my decision	1
about of the time it can t find the device when i attach it to my pc	0
well this apex dvd player turned out great	1
the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person it worked fine fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it in fact it works better than my own laptop so i will change to this one as soon as possible	1
the battery life seems good takes very lttle time to charge it uploads mp s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
these monitors are good value for money	1
the memory is amazing	1
bass fanatics watch s pii	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
do nt buy this player	0
i bought two of these players for christmas but they were broken	0
some of the movies that played yesterday wont play today	0
the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
software music match jukebox is nt the greatest the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut	0
if youre starting from scratch creative media source software can rip catalogs and burn music but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before buying zen and guess what	0
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
it also doesnt have a big drop in voice activated dials	0
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod trackpad	1
maybe it is my lack of experience but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	0
luckily g has a hot boot that can use an external flash and luckily for me i already own a top quality external flash for the money that can buy mace ct	1
i give it stars for its looks	1
i didnt want one in which i would have to put in batteries myself lrb that is a pain rrb i did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and im glad i purchased these speakers	1
it doesnt look good spending that much money and of course you want something aesthetic	0
love the ultra thin design	1
consider this better device before splashing out on an ipod	1
the standard battery include with the g is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority aperature priority light metering adjustments etc but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
they look fantastic	1
finally i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier	0
even when you disable securespot completely it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
second the auto sync feature on creative allows you to view songs before they start transferring	1
does not recognize player at random times despite being connected and displaying player is library	0
thank god its a standout phone	1
finding a particular song or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
there is an alarm i still havent used it yet but it should be good	1
no dropouts good signal strength all over my three story house lrb unit is located on the top floor rrb and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for the price	1
plus it comes with a remote control	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
the sound is surprising full with a fair amount of bass even for such a small unit	1
i cant rate it one star because when it works its very good	0
everything was fine until it started dropping calls occasionally	0
lots of flaws but exceptional sound quality hd size and price make it a good buy	1
it looks very cool and seems quite small to me and very light	1
i have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it just a crude pictorial instruction of installation which leaves a great deal of information missing	0
my only complaint is that when you press down on the roller to select you have to press straight down or it gets stuck	0
i have tried to contact apex several times and they dont seem to respond to emails and the phone number is always busy because a lone customer service representative may be overworked	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
highly recommend this monitor hard to beat at this price point	1
its very light and can fit in your pocket	1
pc cables are too expensive for usb cables	0
first the cons a tad bulky not the most asthetic looking player and does nt support a folder stucture	0
one bad thing was that it came with a pitiful megabit compactflash card which was inadequate for most purposes	0
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
it comes with plenty of wallpaper and chord sweet tunes	1
the controls were harder to use than ipods but i got used to them and didnt even think the huge difference in price was justified at first	0
software is another great misfortune hard to operate crashes frequently screwed my music library up doesnt work with mp s the list goes on and on	0
anyway this player is a great deal and i really like it	1
the rate plans are also very good at least for me	1
after a tormenting few years in at t customer service im happily giving them up and looking forward to the time in august when ill switch the rest of our home phones from at t to t mobile	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the routers interface	0
it worked great and we just pluged it in	1
for the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable	1
the color is red and very glamorous	1
i checked amazon reviews and im happy to say my product worked fine out of the box	1
the canon g gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an auto mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
audio is excellent	1
but this is not documented in the zen handbook either the hard copy or the cd version	0
first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint	1
simply the canon g is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
images taken indoor were nt so clear	0
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i m extremely pleased with it	1
bottom line well made camera easy to use very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
i would strongly recommend this product	1
overall im very happy with the product and will be using it a lot	1
small size	1
the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
there are no adjustments and if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as ive seen them made on film which is a raw image	1
not only is it more affordable but its a better player for windows which is what i have	1
the features are really cool like a radio	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software	1
i havent played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
with this mp player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
we ve purchased universal remotes so far all claiming to work apex dvd players and none worked	0
i know this unit will have problems in the future and this years problem free replacement warranty will be worth it because the idea will only be guaranteed for a few days which in itself is completely ridiculous	0
well it was nice while it lasted	1
it has a x optical zoom which is average for these cameras	0
billy joel was nt kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0
with such a great price on amazon com how can you go wrong	1
it was easy to set up and both my ps asus eee netbook droid and pc connected smoothly	1
so i went and bought a faster router and this one did the admirable job i bought it for	1
ripping the songs even with my usb connection is still very quick and the quality is very good	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
the scene mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a regular setting	1
i ve had this thing for less than a month treated it quite well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all screwed up	0
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax and customization	1
this is an excellent value	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd is are dirty	0
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
the system was nowhere near stable and the code was in alpha stage at best	1
to quote k reeves battery life is the drawback of most digital cameras	1
the battery is better than most phones on the market	1
best camera ever from the image quality color function i can say almost everything	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it is pretty good	0
after several attempts one of the disks was eventually recognized but the video quality was poor and the functionality was not available	0
things are clearer and i dont have to strain and squint as much when trying to read whats on the screen as i do when using my clunky old monitor rrb	1
the software sucks	0
for the first few weeks the player was everything i expected it to be a moderately priced multi format dvd player with the sleek advertised ultra thin case	1
i tried to play the song three times with no success	0
second the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
this price is the lowest ive seen in my research	1
there was neither picture nor sound	0
it allows the usb interface on the router to be used either for nas or print server	1
the players themselves have all sorts of issues	0
after using it i found this size to fit perfectly in my pocket	1
this is by far the nicest one in so many ways	1
the remote feels thin and awkward to use	0
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
great picture	1
it acts as a backup to my music collection which is a huge plus	1
no matter how much you adjust the volume you cant get a decent alto or bass without an inaccurate rumble in the bass unit	0
i really love this netbook	1
people also complain that the case has no windows but thats not a big deal to me the case is sturdy and provides good protection	1
at ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
huge storage i loaded up my entire music collection and while there arent that many songs there are still gigabytes of space to offer you	1
the only two minor issues i had with this camera were the lens cap and the lens itself	0
the pictures are amazing	1
would definitely recommend it to a friend it has the volume to fill a small house and is suitable for such a small speaker system	1
i purchased this phone for just and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
i followed the easy instructions in the manual and once online at the router is login there is a setup wizard which will work with your os if you choose to use it	1
you can manage your profile change the contrast of backlight make different type of display either list or tabbed	1
this phone is a winner	1
they are clean and perfect for use with a submarine	1
they can be more comfortable but there are no complaints in the sound department	1
it doesnt have an autofocus assist light which is great for shooting in low light and it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
i gave the zen stars because it is excellent for the class that it is in and it is not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
it sounds decent but i would estimate you get maybe of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	0
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet	0
otherwise this player is awesome	1
the backlight will periodically fail the first time it happened i sent it in for warranty repair	0
i tried to contact apex to return it but it took months to reach their customer service department	0
its a good unit for the price	1
i prefer the nomads color but its not too fancy	1
you can stand it up and the design is much better than what was available in the s	1
im glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improve it with new technology	1
contrary to what ive read elsewhere the g does sync at of a second with third party flashes just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
what a junk	0
overall a good buy for the price	1
the sound is great but if you play the sound too loud depending on your sound quality the sound may crack	1
it holds so many music and audio files	1
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and specular	1
one drawback though is that the autofocus doesnt work well when the battery is low	0
they sound awesome to me and i havent even touched any equalizer	1
this is a very light phone a little less than oz with long battery life	1
both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it	1
hooked up to the d link extreme n connected speed dropped to mbps and wireless down to mbps	0
its a very good lightweight non invasive device that you can take anywhere with you	1
after years with that carrier is expensive plans and horrible customer service portability seemed heaven sent	0
the case is completely useless as it covers up the display window	0
material is on the cheap side	0
after hooking up the thing i found that it could only play less than the dvds i had put in	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the little camera created the marriage between nikon and me i never knew i would love digital cameras so much	1
it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
the problem with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness causes you to miss valuable footage	0
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	0
great photos	1
wires run through the body of the stand making it look very neat	1
the phone is small lightweight and very attractive	1
unit worked great for weeks then video output failed	0
ripping songs and creating playlists couldnt be easier	1
the only downside is that the remote requires sight lines	0
connect the player to your computer open mediasource and youll be able to listen to your stored mp directly from xtra	1
they wont respond to my emails and the phone lines are always busy	0
i worry that megapixel photos will download more slowly but working with these files doesnt make any difference	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast but it is also eye candy	1
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
i purchased three of these acer at very good rates from amazon we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness	1
frequency adjustment is limited due to the built in speaker divider	0
there is no way the battery supplied lasts hours	0
also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display	0
simply put the product was created and forgotten	0
however you do get what you pay for in reliable products	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod but i have gotten use to them and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
the screen quality is very high and the side view is very sharp	1
that cheap little record player makes a sound like carnegie hall	1
to be honest i like the player	1
all in all this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a laptop and external speakers	1
we got this on time and it was brand new perfect condition performance as can be expected for the machine specifications keep in mind i m extremely computer savvy so my opinion comes to a lot of people	1
very good price	1
when you open the hard drive it doesnt smell like burning plastic	1
easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive	1
canons optics are better and im sure their processing algorithms are better	1
incredible excellent system for an incredible price	1
valet plus is easy to configure and was set up in about minutes	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows no disc	0
it looks great and is feature rich	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
within a year i was having problems with my menu knob	0
when i tried to install a second dvd player in my brothers house that one didnt work either	0
with usb the transfer speed is very fast	1
i didnt get any weird sounds from the side speakers like i didnt with my old front facing speakers	1
i like the nomad is color better but it is not terribly flashy	1
due to lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just abandoned the framework of this router im not impressed	0
player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	0
the sound quality is fantastic and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd is or tapes	1
i try navigating to a chapter past via the menu and it would nt do it	0
the eax features are pretty cool as well as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that for example compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
although i wanted to give it stars not that i gave it one because it worked well and i had it for the time i had it	1
the software must suck and my laptop dies half the time but i wouldnt mind buying notmad	0
the sound settings can be adjusted to suit personal preferences	1
but i would definitely recommend this phone	1
even though its slightly larger than an ipod i must say that when i opened the box i was surprised to see how small it was	1
this tiny remote is awesome not only for triggering the shutter but also for zooming in and out and viewing photos	1
it is very solidly built and has a nice dense feel to it	1
the image quality is excellent	1
if you have an old nokia phone and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone the infrared feature was a boon and saved me hours of re entering numbers	1
also i had no problems reading the svcds and vbr mp cds i made	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
i sent my monitor to acer for repair because my acer gd hz monitor had a small but very serious random buzzing problem	0
the only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight	0
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
creative mediasource although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service	1
this really is the best phone ever made	1
when the screen was nt contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair	0
when i put it to use for my daughter is graduation party in longer lengths the speaker wire worked as expected even out of doors	1
the interface software itself is supposed to be user friendly but its not easy to use	0
a great system at an incredible price	1
my only gripes with this camera are that it looks fairly boxy it requires a wristband rather than a neck strap and its a bit slow between shots	0
i used it with a home theater system and it sounds like the picture clarity is unbeatable and amazing	1
all in all i think its a good value router for the money	1
the sound is awesome but if u put it too loud depends on yoursound quality the sound might crack	1
i love the quality of the photos	1
i was dissapointed that acer was nt more helpful	0
mine doesnt have a bad spot	1
i love bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car and should tell you enough if i say bass is great	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	0
the buttons on the phone are small even for my small fingertips but you get used to them rather quickly	0
while my laptops and netbooks have decent speakers the volume of these devices is naturally lower than standard speakers making it difficult to hear some audio	0
sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well	1
the fact that this model can play jpeg slides is a big plus for me as a visual artist and i stumbled upon the fact that it can play mpeg files from regular cd r data drives without the need for vcd format	1
again the sounds were spot on and projected from where they should the front of the tv	1
apparently t mobile had a huge backlog and couldnt keep up with demand	0
speakerphone	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than the other cheaper apex units	0
i was surprised how good the sound was and i especially like to use it when i am listening to audio books	1
i tried online print ordering with two major brick and mortar retailers in the us and they both had great results	1
the included equipment is so so but its no big deal because thats not what you bought it for	1
it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket	1
the more i work with it the more i like it	1
the interface software itself which should be user friendly was anything but easy to use	0
theres no fm or recording which would be nice extras	0
the pictures are fabulous its been a learning curve and there are a lot of features i havent got yet	1
the sound is so good my boyfriend wants one right now	1
pros so off i went to get a faster router and this one did the job i bought it for admirably	1
the gs battery charging system differs from smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged in the camera but the charging system also allows you to use the camera when plugged in without draining the battery	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
while the machine is flawed the xtra gets five stars for its affordability	1
otherwise a very decent monitor for its price	1
its the best deal	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
i ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
seriously i love it	1
working fine	1
no caller id pictures or personalized ringtone options	0
overall the g offers what must be considered the best image quality in any megapixel digital camera today from the point of view of detailed tone balance and color response	1
i tried navigating with the player in the built in menu but it still didnt work	0
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
the contrast crispness and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca nt be beat	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
the problems came from my video card	0
a call was made and the very helpful technician answered the phone immediately	1
i havent had this camera for very long and wouldnt part with it for anything	1
a relatively low priced progressive scan player	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
i think the software is very good its not complicated to learn at all	1
my only complaint is that the cord is not long enough	0
wow this speaker really rocks	1
it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use	1
this has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap and the lens itself	0
its a very good dvd player for the price	1
user replaceable batteries	1
this product is fantastic	1
very long battery life	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs	1
mixed bag i guess but the price is right	1
the cover that came with it did nt fit very well	0
i have about cds stored on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically	0
it could only play one of the three dvds without problems and the other two were plagued by some glitches	0
plusses are easy to remove with the battery and excellent sound produced by the nomad	1
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter however i was able to find a free third party driver that is compatible	0
the labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires	0
its also a little bigger than expected but thats okay because all i need is something that works with my iphone	0
with this mp player you can get a lot more memory for a lot less money than an ipod	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
lrb lost internet connection with the router internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem rrb	0
silverish color really adds a special touch	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
the image quality is very good	1
all in all its very easy to use	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture	0
after months it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds	0
its a very durable compact package and i feel nikon is a brand i can trust	1
when i got it home i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there	0
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period	1
oops easy to go online and adjust it there	1
its a really great little phone it has great features a nice screen great ergonomics and its small	1
in the hands of people who dont use nt it will produce good results in idiot program automatic mode	1
if you tend to take pictures from a distance shots taken indoors will be a little dull and rarely blurry	0
ive had my nomadic jukebox for about three weeks now and i couldnt be happier with it	1
after about an hour it started jumping like a dirty dvd	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	0
this router does drop every once in a while but not like the old router did every hour or so	0
it performed well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	0
it took me a few tries to get used to the navigation but its a very user friendly interface	1
i got this thing for christmas and have loved it ever since	1
the ihome is stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
the eax sound enhancement isnt enough for me and the custom equalizer is a limited band equalizer	0
also setting up a route to my wamp server was very easy as the process was exactly the same as with my old netgear	1
screen was good easy to read	1
with eax on you can modify your sound with different presets which is pretty good you can get different variations with it	1
also it only has free shipping and no taxes so overall its a decent player	1
i have had this player for months and have been able to see a total of dvd is after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it is job	0
i have windows xp pro and while installing the software that came with it i received a message indicating that there was a problem installing the driver	0
earbuds are average so use your regular earbuds instead	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
due to the heavy snow my router failed today when i needed to work from home	0
what is added in functionality detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	0
looks ok	1
with mediasource being so easy i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	0
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful	0
this has happened with several different dvd is and occasionally if we keep trying something it will work when it did not work one time before	0
and with usb transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
the main problem for me is that the dsub line from the submarine to the control station is too short	0
setup is very simple	1
i chose it right away and took high quality photos each time	1
the menu options are uncreative as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for	0
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1

a the sound produced by this ultra thin design	1
i tried calling support a few times a day for a week but the line was always busy	0
compared to everything else in this category this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1

please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
its a very light phone with a great battery life of less than an ounce	1
very bad quality	0
so far there have been no issues with the dvd not playing	1
first the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1

very tight joints excellent black finish and precise speaker wire hook ups	1
overall i did like the phone but unfortunately im sending it back	1
there was minimal pause time between songs less than on other devices not bad for a hard drive based player	1
it only moves the monitor from side to side with no up and down or tilt function	0
they cause the problem that the wrong product is in the box the service technology fails to believe what software says is wrong	0
a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
it works fine we just plug it in	1
slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headset jack	0
best tech support i have ever experienced	1
even though they look pretty cool in the dark	0
oh i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many functions i havent covered them all yet	1
the browser program did close a few times when i renamed the title and changed the type but i didnt have to reboot the computer or do anything just open the browser again	0
all the other buttons are very sensitive to touch and work fine	1
the display is large enough and the text presentation is sharp enough that youll forget all about workspace issues	1
other than that its a great price showcase	1
it never works	0
this router is by far the best ive used	1
kudos apple though your products are of superb quality your support is equal to that	1
the label on the firmware itself is a mystery suggesting that the company is just scrambling to put out the fire	0

my only significant complaint is sound quality	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	0
they are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub	1
its also very lightweight	1
all i can say is that its a superb design	1
i ve viewed numerous different monitor models since i m a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any i ve seen	0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits connector might be a problem	0
overall i give this one a star because i dont see the issues that people complain about repeatedly but since ive only had a player for a while i wonder if the headphone jack hissing or the scroll wheel issue has come up for me as well	1
its much better if you dont have to go through your isp to use the netgear genie tool and take all the extra steps	0
but anyway what you should really notice is that the phone has voice dialing	1
so now it still plays everything you cant see	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
the only problem i found with the internet service was that it didnt access mls very well at all	0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name	0
setup is simple and it worked right out of the box	1
great phone i d buy another	1
the catch with the canon g camera is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	0
i hate apex but love amazon i tell everyone	0
so far on dvd it has refused to play certain episodes without problems	0
with the smooth knob i found it hard to tell if i was actually holding it and turning it just by feeling it	1
i would nt mind having an external adjustable antenna but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved	1
the speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer	1
since it wouldnt work as advertised i called support	0
i bought this apex dvd player for myself at christmas as it received excellent reviews on a variety of different websites and was considered good value for money	1
connect the player to your computer open up mediasource and you can listen to your stored mp s as they stream directly from the xtra	1

the quality is superb	1
this led display is awesome	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
the photos are absolutely stunning and the camera captures the most minute details	1
its easy for beginners to use but has some features that more serious photographers will enjoy so its a good camera to use	1
the battery stays charged for a long time and takes no more than or hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
it will only move the monitor side to side lrb no up down or tilt feature rrb	0
ive had this thing for less than a month handled it well never dropped it and the headphone jack is all busted	0
third bad design continues with the case	0
transferring windows through windows explorer recognises the disc drive as an attached hard drive so you can simply drag and drop files from windows explorer into nomads folder	1
works great	1
this camera is worth every penny and i highly recommend it	1
i followed the simple instructions in the manual and once logged in on the router a setup wizard appears that will work with your operating system if you choose to use it	1
the software that comes with the player is not good at all	0
the picture quality is amazing and if you want you can hook it up to your tv so you can make silent movies	1
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	0
as often mentioned the scroll tab is average however not difficult to use or horrible	1
i did nt abuse it i charged it every day but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	0
the eax features are really cool and creative including some eq tweaks such as compensating for exotic noises encountered in cars or trains	1
wire runs through the body of the stand giving it a very clean look	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
the sound superb synth tone ringtone is very good and it also doubles as a radio which is a great feature to have when youre bored	1
of course i did quite a bit of vetting before buying and price wise the zens is unbeatable	1
the appearance is okayed	1
im still very frustrated with some properties but now that ive saved the equalizer settings and know i have to open my sound card control panel every time i switch between music and video or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
it plays basically every media i ve tested so far even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old sharp player	1
it takes approximately to seconds to come back online lrb i have nt timed it rrb which does nt sound that bad until you get nailed times in one hour lrb that is about as bad as it gets sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting rrb	0
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problems came	1
other tagging problems result from the nomad is operating system	0
i do nt for see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do i will know that with this product it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be	1
recieved this product in time for a gift giving works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly	1
it is so small but big value mac	1
having an id tag that is not filled in will result in music being potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
i easily paired it with two different android phones	1
the building quality is top notch	1
the zenx replaceable battery was my deciding factor in buying a zenx over an ipod	1
i bought this phone just no end what can i do with it	1
it is worth it	1
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	0
i chose the g because of its reputation for very high quality clean images	1
on the up side the phone has amazing battery life	1
battery life was good though i recommend two rechargeable batteries or an alkaline backup battery for emergencies	1
if youve come to expect anything from a netbook youll be pleasantly surprised at how well the product works	1
so far the router has worked well	1
it also has a built in stock tracking app and a useful app for converting all types of metrics	0
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery just like any other battery powered appliance	1
at first i dealt with this as mbps was still really fast	1
sub woofer is large	1
i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
the office starter webcam is also pretty nice lightweight and elegant on the downside and i wont say anything bad about it because youre just paying for the book	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see and the text is big enough for people to see	1
now that i own it however i can t imagine being without it	1
i dont abuse it i charge it every day but the headphone jack is a bit out of order	0
megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
i could tell there was a big difference in contrast brightness and viewing angles between this monitor and the dell ultrasharp	1
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	0
the autofocus performed well but i liked the optional scene modes which were virtual and matched many of the situations i actually used the camera in	1
canon is optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	1
the nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
seems like a good deal but this pos often fails to recognize dvds and music cds and takes a long time to load before concluding there are no discs	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay for this great player	1
for those who want to thump this is capable of producing lrb very good computer speaker rrb this may be necessary	1
portable lcd screens are great	1
however if speed reliability and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements then this router will do the job	1
my only gripe with the hardware is the buttons	0
the creative lab zen xtra has all the features of i pod and if you buy it from amazon youll only be paying for this great player	1
this is a great piece speaker system for a computer and it is worth every penny	1
cheap user replaceable batteries are a big advantage of the ipod because of the cost involved in replacing them	1
it also has unproven battery life	0
in fact each of my creative mp players had software problem in the first place	0
this led monitor is fantastic	1
battery life is good although i recommend two rechargebles or a alkaline backup for those emergency pics you have to have	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
creative mediasource software is ok to rip catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen and guess what	0
i tried to connect the device to several different tvs using multiple connection methods but still couldnt get a video signal from the machine	0
the line by line scanning option can be easily turned off with a single button on the remote which is one of the simplest and easiest removals ive seen or used	1
some movies it played yesterday it wo nt play today	0
nokia and t mobile have worked really well together on this product	1
picture quality is excellent	1
the picturers are amazing	1
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
now heres the stuff you should know to start with the good stuff the screen is really big the back blu ray is perfect for fast as hell in the music transfer control is easy to use after mastering the scroll button great sound i heard many mp players tons of different equalizer types trading here	1
awesome camera with great print quality in a small package	1
i m glad canon decided to keep the mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
as i mentioned before the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said though notmad may still work better	1
looking up specific songs or albums on the nomad jukebox is quick and easy	1
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile is services because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	0
easy enough to navigate through although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll pushbutton	1
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
my only complaint is that the string isnt long enough	0
d link support was polite and tried to help but just through a script and was not successful	0
on average indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as mm	0
maybe its my lack of experience but i find the pictures taken with this camera very disappointing	0
the internal network still works but cannot transmit internet signals over the cable modem	0
ive tried playing all of these discs and they all play well	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	0
oh and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
the beautiful home theater and clear treble from the music speakers define the mid range and the respectable bass	1
huge storage space even at kbs you can store tons of songs on this	1
unlike some others who received lemons my dvd player was in perfect working order	1
the build quality is top notch	1
that is a rare and valuable feature	1
it has very good range and is much better than the linksys router it replaces	1
portable	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
the first routers worked for years	1
replacement battery is compared to ipod is	1
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price you can t go wrong	1
the woofer is much larger	1
the quick ship out items are in good condition and come with easy to use setup disks and since its delivery we havent reconfigured the router so far so my wife stopped telling me about her laptop losing its wireless internet connection added security benefits neighbors no longer hogging the signal well worth the purchase price	1
is it great to have access to so much music no matter where you go	1
nice and compact	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
the excels as a cell phone thank god	1
this manual is easy to understand and is basically for dummies	1
i spend hours day in a vnc session with dark colors the colors and brightness change across the panel when i look from the center to the corner	0
unfortunately the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	0
also unlike my previous players navigation is an advantage while playing music	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment	0
while i would like to give it stars instead of i gave it a because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
the headphones are nt the best but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	0
the software music matching jukebox is not the biggest search feature is not very fast even when accessing its hotkey shortcuts	0
while there are flaws with the machine the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
or maybe netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does nt know what to do	0
to my amazement even that process was error prone	0
harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment the avr produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity	1
takes excellent photos	1
my overall experience with the monitor was very poor	0
also for some reason the image looks faded on the s video compared to the component connection with a lot of oozing color	0
we are well pleased with the monitor and the company	1
difficult navigation i wouldnt necessarily say difficult but i dont like navigating with rollers	0
i was reluctant to accept shoddy construction that i had paid more than for	0
in addition it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	0
the sound quality is really good	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
but when we went to use it again there was sound but no picture	0
the transfer speed via usb is surprisingly fast	1
easy hookup	1
lots of interesting features are included such as eax and customization	1
i highly recommend this product	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
overall i would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price	1
the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective	0
its back working and im glad the rumours i heard about acer tech support didnt turn out to be true in my case	1
when it works its fine but i have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches	0
the reason i rate it a is because that damn diopter adjustment dial is very small and hard to turn so you cant get an accurate adjustment	0
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	0
i am quite happy with the camera	1
data transfer from network storage is slow but i only use it occasionally for backup so it doesnt bother me too much	0
this is a great portable speaker system but want people to know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you cant dock the ipod without removing the skin first	1
the speakers are good no doubt sound good for size range is what you might expect and an lrb of this size is probably better than expected	1
screen brightness is really good	1
but if you ve used a slr mm camera the controls are very intuitive	1
very convenient to scroll in menu etc	1
a few days later the video output stopped working	0
as it stands this situation is pretty useless unless you pack the player for travel or if youve loaded all your songs into it beforehand	0
fm radio it didnt	0
for the most part this is a good dvd player	1
the next day i turned on my laptop which was connected to the network but had no internet connection	0
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
with my sennheiser headphones the volume is loud enough	1
this camera has canon is great colorimetry plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
the keys were close together and the layout was a little quirky for a standard rectangular layout keyboard but not too weird	0
im looking for a cheap dvd player that has more features than a standard dvd player and this product seems to be the best in its class	1
the body structure in general has quite a bit of plastic in it and in s	0
at the end of the day what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go and the zen xtra is combination of price capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything	1
no propietary headset jack	0
for price and features its certainly good	1
im not very happy with this machine or acer	0
this is a very timely standard shipping service	1
overall this is the best camera on the market	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited band eq	0
it takes about to seconds to restore the online lrb i didnt time the rrb which doesnt sound so bad until you get the fixed time lrb in an hour which is the worst and sometimes it lasts for hours without restarting the rrb	0
the possibilities with auto manual and the very helpful scene mode which offers optimized situational settings like portrait landscape beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
the battery life is amazing	1
the speakers perform very well and with the bass boost the sound fills outs exceedingly well	1
including the ringtones are awesome and did i mention they are polyphony	1
ive had it for about a month and i have to say im loving it	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does nt show the complete filenames of mp s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting before getting back to normal size	0
very happy with the monitor and the price	1
however the shared port on the new router still works at the time	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable	1
the included earplugs are uncomfortable	0
i have not played with all the features yet but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it	1
i was disappointed and looked elsewhere for something that could withstand the rigors of the business traveler	0
when i saw a lot of plastic where there was metal i was concerned that the sound would not be as good	1
i give this player a cautious recommendation	1
the speakers are nice no question about it the sound is good for the size the range is what you might expect from speakers this size lrb perhaps even better than expected rrb	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	0
once again sounds were positioned and projected from the front of the tv where they should be	1
the acer monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area lrb from a heighth perspective rrb that many screens will not fit in	1
excellent sound i found the music faithfully reproduced via the jukebox	1
what rubbish	0
in all i d say this is a decent router for the money	1
i am using them in my office and they generally sound good	1
i expected the x digital zoom to be somewhat rough but in full size high quality the zoomed image was impressive	1
due to the lack of support for whs upnp guestnetwork and having just dropped the bones for this router i was very unimpressed	0
this software is not a hassle to me at all	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a learning curve to it there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to	1
quite simply the firmware and or operating system that controls this thing isnt ready yet	0
the subwoofer is a bit muffled and still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer at full volume but it doesnt matter because these are computer speakers	0
i have emailed their customer service department to request a copy of the ra but have not heard back	0
its focusing system is also very flexible	1
even if the default settings are left in place they produce clear playback	1
playlists can be made on the fly without the help of a computer and you can use playback modes such as random play and repeat to play the selection or playlist you are playing	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	0
im looking forward to it even if all the other reviews say its slow	0
months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	0
the apex ad runs all dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
woofers are bigger	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	0
the quality is very poor	0
the tiny remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
this is my second creative lab mp player and its definitely a good product	1
the sound this slim design puts out	1
the replacement was even worse than the original one which was now working fine	1
excellent heavy build quality and stand is not imposed and blends into my furniture to rest fairly well	1
the cover could have popped up easily but i always put mine in the case so i didnt notice after the first day	0
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1
i am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications	1
range of features as mentioned above it has pointing and shooting features for everyone as well as advanced features for those who are serious about photography	1
the case was too small and it took me half an hour to fit the behemoth into the cage	0
besides the sound is so crisp and clear that i would still buy it all	1
it is smaller than i expected when i ordered it but as it turns out so much the better	1
the tenor isnt the best but its certainly there enough to satisfy anyone who isnt going to spend money on a computer speaker	0
over for the price this is a good unit	1
this creative software is hard to use and doesnt load on some computers	0
i like extremely low bass hence i complement this system with a cute jbl sub	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful mb compactflash card and for most purposes it is not enough	0
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
the design is stylish and the color screen has good resolution	1
the zoom bobs up and down in magnification which is fine but in most settings there is always a zoom size display about a quarter down from the top of the screen which interferes with viewing	0
its a great piece of computer speaker system and its worth every penny	1
all the latest acer products are top of the line	1
these speakers are great	1
the ihomes stereo reproduction is clearly superior	1
i was disappointed that acer didnt do more to help	0
after using it for about a month i can say with absolute certainty that this nikon is definitely good value for money	1
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
also the display is hinged and it can be placed in a myriad of positions or protect it from any damage	1
it is great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
this product is amazing	1
only if we could get one camera in it	0
i ve also had the nomad zen lock up several times	0
this monitor is highly recommended and unbeatable at this price point	1
t mobile also has good service	1
the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
great camera and price you cant beat it	1
while i was impressed by the ease of use i was disappointed by the price of the player which was higher than what id paid for it on amazon	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
because other people who complain about this player are talking rubbish this player is so good his break is so fast its horrible	1
the phone is small light and very attractive	1
however my hard drive did fail and i didnt drop it once	0
i had to struggle to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the chinese name of the song as the title	0
anyway bad equipment bad customer service runs from this product like hell	0
oh and the screen saver is cute	1
the keypad is a decent size but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	0
delivery was prompt	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months i have had it	1
the software is absolutely horrible	0
neither message was answered	0
the larger screen allows me to put all my photos on it instead of on the dells screen and edit them	1
this is a great portable speaker system but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iskin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin	1
its surprisingly fast for computers to process and ship directly	1
in short if you re just someone that is a little afraid of technology and you just want a router to get online do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day this router is great for you	1
its fast forward and rewind work much smoother and more stable than other models ive used	1
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful pictures detail challenges all of the above mp cameras are easy to understand and use many features and additional options come with great software and last but not least my fianc was approved	1
i m quite happy with my new speaker bar	1
full spectrum sound from full bass to treble	1
my only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and i am not sure why do nt know if it was something that i did or if it was a malfunction of the router	0
the sounds fit with the intent of the films director	1
for the price there is nothing better	1
the picture is clear bright and sharp and the sound is decent	1
update the finish is more mirror than silver and i like it	1
third the poor design continues with the case	0
given the price and specs this is probably the best option for buying a large memory mp player	1
the camera is so easy to use in fact that on a trip last week i was asked to take pictures of a group of elderly people on holiday	1
we dont play a lot of discs	0
the sound is great and the volume is perfect for commuting and blocking outside noise	1
the camera is very easy to use in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
all the necessary buttons and gadgets are on the side of the player which is great when you hold it in the palm of your hand	1
the phone is great with a ton of features built in	1
because of it is hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd is	1
the volume	0
nice machines but i consider their quality pretty low now	0
other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and i would still purchase this all over again	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
i got this for use on my truck and i m happy with it for the most part it is loud and super easy to install however you are going to want an amp for i	1
however for a budget i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong	1
i dont want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
the creative labs customer support website is useless	0
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded high performance travel size camera i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality mega pixel	1
id tag editing in the program is also a plus	1
selected it because it looked easy to install	1
well backlit keypad	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
ive been ripping songs with it for the past few weeks and its ease of use has been excellent	1
my only complaint is that like everyone else here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth connection which is really annoying when it does as it often does	0
it is easy for beginners to use but has features that more serious photographers will love so it is an excellent camera to grow into	1
the has the radio function which is utterly useless	0
the scroll button is sometimes overly sensitive and sometimes not sensitive enough	0
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	0
i am very happy with the quality and durability	1
i also like the fact that you can save your customised playlists on the player not just on the computer	1
it works flawlessly during installation of cx	1
easy enough but it did not work	0
all in all bad device bad customer service run like hell from this product	0
thuumbs up to acer widescreen ultra slim monitor	1
my wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen	1
the controls on the player are very simple no need for a manual	1
its worth the wait because ag neovo is an excellent monitor that does all of these things and more	1
without a doubt i would say that the sound quality of these speakers is on par with the jbl on stage and is truly portable lrb that can play without an electrical outlet a feature i love	1
i thought it was too bright	0
the screen scratches easily but if you have a warranty you should be able to replace it	0
having spent considerable time with professional video gear i find onscreen displays annoying	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	0
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
this was an awesome player before the video output no longer worked	0
the headphone earbuds are average so just use your regular pair instead	1
bottom line it did nt work the way it was supposed to so we re returning it we bought this router for our two computers	0
the prints are beautiful	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
automatic manual and very useful scene mode possibilities provide optimized scene settings such as people scenic beach snow sunset etc are endless	1
great product perfect for my office	1
this one functions as a radio but its useless	0
the player has firmware that eliminates any glitches	1
better yet you dont have to worry about constantly changing batteries	1
nokia was my first nonflip phone and i m glad i decided to go with them	1
while the ease of use was very impressive i was put off by the price about more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
however its x optical setting is acceptable for of the shots that i take	1
i use it to rip record cds and it does a great job	1
the router recognized my other wifi devices easily and further setup was a breeze	1
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files	1
it has a beautiful design lots of features very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
its fast to ship and easy to install	1
i simply love this feature	1
even for such a small unit the sound is surprisingly bass	1
the player has an issue that dual layer dvds are such as alias seasons and seasons	0
usb network storage is said to be slow	0
without a doubt i would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage and are truly portable lrb can be played without a power outlet i love that feature rrb	1
they are very sturdy and have no trouble balance wise or handling oddly shaped speakers	1
set up wpa with no problems	1
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
photos are great when i take outdoor photos in plenty of light and the object isnt moving	1
the monitors were both good	1
it has a usb port so you can plug in usb driven drives and have network accessible storage	1
seems to read most dvds fine and reads quietly	1
it wont play all my movies	0
the picture quality in outdoor conditions is not much different from mm	1
the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	0
minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
for the cost of this product i could not ask for more	1
i just bought this phone and i think its the coolest phone ive ever had	1
the pictures are razor sharp even in macro	1
the player had a few glitches such as when i turned it on it was off of the time which meant i had to turn it off and on again which wasnt my cup of tea	0
from the settings in the box to the full working and programming of the preset fm station in less than a few minutes	1
it is easy enough to pop it open to see what song you re listening to	1
the screens are good and easy to read	1
the next day i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network but no internet connection	0
also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do nt bother this is a much better buy	1
the memory is staggering	1
a month back door broke	0
the macro mode is excellent and the photos are so sharp that you can get up close with your lens	1
not a bad monitor for but it is nothing special	1
it would just spin up and stop and display no disc	0
good range speed	1
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	0
with eax you can modify your sound with different presets which is great and you can get different variations with it	1
the system is terrific in size and design imo looking better than the ipods	1
the software was another misfortune difficult to work with it crashed a lot messed up my music library couldnt use my mp s there was a lot more	0
so slow that it is not useable for files of any size or back ups	0
sometimes the system would hang so i would have to restart the router then get going again	0
the image quality is excellent	1
i found apex advertising to be a good deal	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
electronics that tend to be conservative dont impress me easily but this one does deserve five stars	1
to my ears a kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i can t create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again	0
harmon international does a great job with all these devices and the avr produces a very clear sound	1
i love this player	1
the g has trouble focusing in low light and wont take pictures when the shutter is pressed but will take pictures a few seconds after the shutter is released	0
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order	0
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality poor product support difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	0
i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over dollars for	0
anyway the price wont be a problem	1
the very intuitive menu is a big plus for this camera	1
the main dial is not backlit	0
it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim and the radio	1
however once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work i like to get done with some background music viola the audio is great lrb well this is relative great for a computer speaker rrb	1
i get complete coverage everywhere in my house lrb about sq ft rrb and it is located in the corner of my basement	1
even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers	1
images taken indoors are less sharp	0
i have had no problems with the phone	1
after seeing and hearing the sound of the i tour pop speaker i was sold	1
sound exceptional though i can t really compare it to the ipod	1
im having a problem with my archos	1
so annoyance aside this is a good speaker of the amount i pay	1
unable to create folders for audio files	0
setup from in the box to completely working and programmed for preset fm stations was under minutes	1
but it seems to work so well now that i do nt anticipate any problems with it	1
for years carriers expensive plans and horrendous customer service portability seemed like a godsend	0
the display is clear and bright and works very well	1
i tried a bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
this item was the most inexpensive inch monitor available to me at the time i made the purchase	1
meanwhile the apple users instructions instructed me that i should load the disc but it turned out that it only contained a pdf instruction that didnt provide any explanation about the installation of the apple computer	0
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp players but finally decided on this one and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it is the best one out there	1
i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
even after reading some of the instructions its still hard to figure it out	0
value comparing data storage with price	1
its also good for the internet i just wish there were more wap web pages	1
battery life the drawback to most digital cameras to quote k reeves	1
the dslr image programming and exposure controls give you room to be creative but its programs and auto exposure settings can provide excellent photos if you dont want to bother with those settings	1
convenient because it works via a usb port	1
it is easy	1
since it would not work as advertised i called support	0
connection to the device is so easy	1
it looks cool and is small and light to me	1
the camera has a cool splicing picture feature just check out canons website to learn more	1
my main reason for not being happy with this product however is that it locks up at odd times	0
these speakers are great	1
the mount is easy to use just strapped to the handlebars with a velcro belt	1
my blu ray player and wd live tv box usually smile and light a cigarette after a firmware upgrade and have performed well ever since	1
high quality pictures and features	1
this camera has a major design flaw	0
another good thing is that the unit has both optical and coaxial digital audio output although the latter is not mentioned in the literature that i scanned before buying	1
i have sent my ad back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
exasperated at am i called it quits and will be sending this awful deceptive product back	0
to keep it short this is cheaper and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod	1
bottom line is the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
i wont buy it again because of customer service	0
i selected the right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
i chose this one because from what i read it was the best deal for the money	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
great phone id buy another one	1
the second dvd player has a faulty power supply that causes occasional failure to turn on	0
my jpeg pictures are viewable on my screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my monitor	0
the in program id tag editing is a strong point as well	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from mm	1
not only is it more affordable but its the better windows player ive had	1
its a good deal for music and data storage	1
our special friends at creative have given this thing great sound quality great features great battery life and an unbeatable price	1
yes the picture quality and features of any camera in this price range are unbeatable too numerous to list	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	0
i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs using a multitude of connection methods and i still can t get a video signal from the machine	0
its easy for a beginner like me to use but it has a lot of features that i need to get used to	1
its small	1
the only problem i have is that the buttons on the mouse pad are too hard	0
you have to press buttons hard and i often hit enter when i want to scroll	0
because it helps the average photographer take spectacular pictures	1
slow to download and run certain programs wish you the best and hope my review helped	0
this dvd play is basicly junk	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
this small speaker system provides excellent sound for most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	0
the picture is fantastic when receiving the apex dvd and setting it up using the s connector	1
it really impressed me with the disign the specs the price	1
overall i like it	1
does what it should and the sound seems fine to me	1
sure its a little bigger than an ipod but not by much	0
i am using jbl n ii as surround left right which is again a very nice excellent speaker set	1
it is small	1
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out	0
you can stop looking for the best n router you can find today	1
zennx is replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
this time d link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem which was that the router failed to auto negotiate the ethernet link speed from my fios optical network block	1
there is also no height adjustability so it sits very low to the desk	0
the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors	1
the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying	0
it will read and play all cd audio discs	1
you certainly have some great customization options as well	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
the nikon coolpix is wonderful easy to use high quality and compact in size	1
all in all i love this camera and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality point and a mid priced camera	1
its too difficult to change genre album track information for a large number of tracks	0
mp x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above mp cameras easy to understand and use a lot of features and add on options comes with great software and last but by far not least received my fiance is stamp of approval	1
you can stop looking this is the best n router you will find today lrb i am writing this on nov rrb	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly and there is no way to change this	0
the main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short	0
very tight joints excellent black polish and precise speaker wire connections	1
navigation system zen xtra uses id tags embedded in mp files to organize your songs	0
the dvd player is fine	1
minor complaint even though the music is sorted through the id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in the folder is not available	0
works super easy	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and within minutes i had all my wireless devices lrb laptop desktop and smartphone rrbs connected to the internet	1
i was surprised at how good the sound was and i especially enjoyed using it while listening to audio books	1
if you want a quality product delivered on time buy this one	1
my hearing is good but the volume on this phone is particularly low	0
the theory is great but once the guest network is enabled things stop	0
the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic	1
this compact digital camera is especially useful if you have small children around and you can take lots of pictures of them with you at all times	1
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work	0
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had	1
the fm radio is cool	1
quite simply the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
got a system error problem days after purchase	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station the phone itself doesnt have any weight its too light and feels comfortable to use	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp s	1
im very pleased with this camera	1
it is just such a nice light weight non intrusive device which you can take anywhere	1
i bought the canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
the unit worked for a few weeks and then the video output failed	0
the keys are close together and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads but it is not too weird	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was fairly painless	1
my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field	0
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod	0
pros huge storage capacity for the price easy to navigate can modify existing playlists on the fly has a removable battery	1
i did nt get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like i did with my old front speakers	1
occasionally there is the issue of lip synching	0
i m still very frustrated with some of the properties but now that i have saved equalizer settings and know i have to open up my sound card is control panel every time i switch between music and videos or games the sound is much more acceptable	0
i chose this one because from my perspective its the best deal	1
the eax mode keeps the volume of any song at the same level which comes in handy when im flying on holiday	1
in the hands of someone who does nt it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
i was worried that megapixel photos would download more slowly but there is no difference in working with the files	1
cons i think the satellites look ugly	0
no way to contact their customer service	0
after a long and extensive journey to a feature loaded high performance travel camera i was initially attracted to this little gem for its high picture quality megapixels	1
this is great for your first dvd player	1
i m sure it would and can be useful in a different setting one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper	1
ive had a few nomadic zen locks too	0
they sound really good just as the reviews say	1
would nt buy again because of the customer service	0
we bought two phones for our t mobile family plan one with broken headphones and one with no battery after less than two weeks	0
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	0
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub	1
software definitely sucks hangs up my notebook about half the time but i do nt mind buying notmad	0
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
theyre not good stuff	0
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be better	0
unless we can fit a camera in it	0
overall the g delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current megapixel digicams from a detail tonal balance and color response point of view	1
this product is definitely worth buying	1
in any case its okay to navigate by artist albums but i missed the ability to navigate by folders	0
another point worth noting is that the battery life is incredible	1
compared to other products in this category this is definitely the best value for money	1
it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash you want something that has the asthetics bit down of course	0
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp player	1
it came well packaged	1
in fact others say not bright enough	0
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files	1
the layout of the keys is normal so theres no guesswork	1
the backlight malfunctions periodically and this is the first time ive sent in a warranty	0
loved the slim design	1
the dvd player is fine	1
the black flywheel feels cheap and uncomfortable to use	0
the keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable although it does take some getting used to	1
g looks like a work of art	1
the update finish is more specular than silver and i like it	1
multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
the player has firmware which will remove the glitches if there are any	1
died very shortly after getting them	0
the windows premium is good lrb do nt recommend starter rrb and user friendly	1
it is a fun little gadget do nt expect high definition sound	0
the controls of this player are very simple and do not require instructions	1
longer battery life greater accessibility to online music services and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position	1
the acer monitor has a very bright screen that is designed to allow placement from a high angle in an area lrb that many screens do not fit into	1
price	1
the hard drive i had attached to the usb port was sometimes accessible sometimes not	0
both monitors are good	1
its so small but its great value	1
the top cover covering the battery kept popping open and the latch on the bottom was barely touched	0
also the feature that automatically puts in song information isnt always accurate	0
for instance i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r and r and it plays the dvds	1
i ordered them on the lrb on monday afternoon for no extra shipping and by the time i got home from work on tuesday the monitor was on my doorstep in chicago	1
also very light and portable	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	0
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out	0
we got it just in time and it was new in perfect condition performance as expected by the machine specifications keep in mind that i am very computer savvy so my opinion goes out to many people	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	0
good cell phones look a lot better than what you see in pictures	1
the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod and it weighs a little bit more	0
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
i tried to contact apex to return it and it took months to get through to their customer service dept	0
full spectrum sound from full base to great highs	1
the person on the other end of the phone can hear you clearly	1
it is tall so i ended up laying it on its side	0
the replaceable battery is great because once it finally runs out you will be able to easily purchase another one	1
great colors pictures and white balance	1
i was in awe of this canon camera which is available in g	1
tech support is rude and unhelpful	0
i should ve trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of acer	0
the monitor is easy to set up and it also works as promised when used with my new nvidia glasses	1
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver	0
living in a small college apartment the e s and e s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed	1
p its not light weight so i would definitely recommend it to anyone	0
if you are not picky about image quality go for it	0
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	0
sound is good too the lrb although not reflective like the surround system rrb i only really noticed it when the monitor was off in which case you could see your reflection on the screen	1
without having to go through the netgear genie tool through the isp and taking all the extra steps would be far better	0
i m very happy with these i ll probably buy more for the front channels	1
unlike some of the other people who received a lemon my dvd player came in perfect working condition	1
normal volume	1
sound quality is wonderful i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
well this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
i have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone not while it is ringing	0
nikon i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
these speakers are incredibly amazing	1
however once you turn up the volume just a little bit its a little too distracting for my job i like to use some background music for the viola and the audio is great	1
battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every or days or so	1
ive had one for a few months now and im happy with my decision	1
this machine is going to change everything you think about laptops	1
it worked from to at which time the picture failed completely	0
sharp image	1
no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	0
the sound is great the battery life is great the fact that the battery is interchangeable is great and finally so is the price thats cheaper than the gb ipod	1
the zoom lever is unstable i hope it is not mechanically operated or you will feel uncomfortable	0
this machine is a replacement for your desktop	1
technical support rude and unhelpful	0
speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
for the price it is a very nice dvd player	1
good looks	1
certainly fills a room with sound better than any other computer speakers i own	1
storage capacity	1
even looking at cds full of jpgs	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
the tech support hotline is responsible for making tech support calls to me	1
i have stored around cd is on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
unfortunately the installation software crashed several times and i had to reboot my vista pc at least twice not fun	0
the speakers performed extremely well and the sound was filled in very well with enhanced bass	1
now there is one more complaint i have about the g and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the mbyte cf with a mbyte cf which gives me raw images as opposed to	0
i spend hours a day in dark vnc meetings and the color and brightness of the entire panel changes as i look from center to corner	0
batteries are good	1
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward but i can deal with that	0
best tech support ive ever experienced	1
if you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs	1
the canon g gives photo lovers plenty of control but still has an automatic mode which makes it easy for novices to use	1
the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
overall small sounds great and is cheaper than apples overpriced ipods	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures and doesnt take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
best in class sound	1
the display is large enough and the text rendering is sharp enough that you ll forget entirely about workspace issues	1
this has happened with several different dvds and occasionally it will work if we keep trying something that didnt work before	0
navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
bass fanatics look at the s pii	1
setup was very easy	1
you can do other different things with it like select the interface that plays now and you can see if the interface is modern or classical	1
very good value for money	1
upon opening these i found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them	1
other things i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard mm headphone jack	0
for me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable	1
great price	1

like other reviewers installation was hell	0
this camera has a fantastic array of features	1

i love the size and weight of this little animal	1
i found the nomad interface very easy to use if you have a basic understanding of computers	1
the value for money looks just right	1
the problem was that the fastest anything could connect to it even in the same room was only about megabits	0
overall i m giving this stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx into my toyota camry mode	1

this machine is very lightweight and perfect for my tv cabinet	1
seems like a good product	1
i am bored with the silver look	0
this camera has a major design flaw	0

but if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player i love it	1
this phone is a winner	1
excellent color display with clear images and just the right size for my desk	1
good speed range	1
can t beat carrying cd collection with me wherever i go	1
music organization is based on id and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
i m also running in wall rated insulated gauge speaker wire and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly even through the groove in the bottom of the base	1
their network coverage is very fragmented and the network seems to be constantly overloaded resulting in a very unpleasant calling experience	0
thanks to amazons amazing return policy i was able to return it without a loss	1
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
other than that the event was great	1
its generally smaller than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because the zx uses different cheap but not necessarily shoddy technology	1
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but it is a very user friendly player imo	1
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1

i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
the truth is it couldnt be easier	1
i also ran speaker wire in wall rated insulation specifications and the stand fits this thick wire perfectly even through the grooves at the bottom of the base	1
i m giving this player cautious recommendation	1
for the most part its a good dvd player	1
for those who want the thump that this is capable of producing lrb very good for a computer speaker rrb this is probably necessary	1
i didnt want a speaker where i had to put my own batteries in which was a pain and i did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews and im glad i bought these speakers	1
granted i have only used this dvd player for about hours setting it up for my mom for christmas but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	0
the little speaker sounds amazing	1
its small and lightweight looks nice and has a decent display	1
less than a month later the screen froze and eventually showed no cd	0
i am so tired of netgear is product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	0
it has so many features that you will always have room for them as new technology develops	1
i dont know what other people are saying but the software is awesome	1
the larger g lens provides better image quality in low light while the optical zoom lets you look closer	1
the canon computer software used to download sort upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
i used this monitor for years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de focused text	0
the build quality feels solid it does nt shake or whine while playing discs and the picture and sound is top notch	1
there are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built in speaker crossovers	0
ooh and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet	1
the dvd player doesnt work properly	0
also the lens cap design is flawed	0
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
mp is right for this cameras target market	1
feedback on creative information system product support is generally poor and this is not limited to zen it applies to all corporate information system products	0
it has a nice color screen	1
i dont have any problems with this product	1
it was my christmas present and it was a great gift	1
work super easy	1
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to guide me through manual settings	1
i havent tried to use all the adjustment options shutter priority aperture priority metering adjustment etc but all the controls are well thought out and the manual is relatively clear	1
this player is an ideal purchase	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakers are great	1
the light auto correction is fantastic	1
the player is mechanics are also flawed	0
i love the sound of these products as well as the polk and klipsich landing tripods with similar properties	1
the only problem i have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff	0
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in a basement four bars all the time	1
neither message was returned	0
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature to find out more just log on to canon is website	1
using the included transmission cable the picture does not transfer directly from the camera to the pc	0
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	0
lrb yeah like you ll use a new very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge rrb i returned the item and got a linksys dsl modem instead	0
seems to be able to read most dvds very well and read them in silence	1
mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	0
it had a few inconveniences one being that songs didnt auto play like a cd one after another	0
my blu ray player and wd live tv box normally lean back smile and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade and perform well forever thereafter	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
all in all this is a fantastic player that blew me away with features that are easy to use and understand the software is easy to understand and use and the sound is great	1
overall i liked it	1
the recent price drop makes the g the best deal for digital cameras right now	1
the range is comparable to or perhaps slightly worse than the older linksys routers ive used for years	0
what really makes it a mediocre mp player for me is the software	0
you need to buy new headphones the old ones suck	0
they claim to respond in a hour period yet it is been weeks without a reply	0
the automatic settings do a good job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
volume	0
i like to put it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
i got it today its size and price is very good the sound is very good i know the volume of the iphone and the volume of the tower itself are two different things and should be put in the right measure to get better sound quality so i dont complain that the remote cant control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
but i would definately recommend this phone	1
i really dont have any complaints about this unit	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
i love the product	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist and i discovered by accident that it will play mpeg files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
being able to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
awesome sound system	1
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to quickly navigate menus	1
scrollbars are a bit of a headache	0
sometimes my hard drive connected to a usb port can be accessed sometimes it cant	0
with the push of a button you can move the focus range to almost any location in the scene and it has an on screen manual focus mode which can be useful if shooting scenes that are difficult to autofocus	1
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue	0
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works well	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb	1
the volume range is wide so you can blow it up if you want	1
so if you want to play around with it youll probably be pretty happy with the forecast for the day	1
i was listening to a song the other day and it got locked up and now it cant do anything	0
repeated software failures	0
well it had good power but no precision at all	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims	1
the ad didnt work properly in the first place and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to work	0
overall i am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
the canon g is perhaps the best mp camera out there	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
however shareport on this new router worked of the time	0
another point of note the battery life is incredible	1
other then that it is a fantastic display for the price	1
i d tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try this	0
zen stores data files but does not allow folder structure nor does it allow opening files or launching programs from disk	0
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s	0
only owned it for about two weeks so im hoping well see another higher quality progressive scan dvd player soon	0
the connection to the device is very simple	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
no problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted months	1
it works like a charmingly great picture with bright colors and very light weight	1
it does nt have firewire not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves	0
the speed is too slow to use for files or backups of any size	0
i quite like the audio sync which allows the player to sync with the music collection on the computer in one click	1
worked fine	1
connection speed to the other machines seems awesome much quicker than the router i replaced and when combined with the simplicity of the valet plus this makes for a great product	1
its tall so i end up putting it aside	0
unfortunately the installation software crashed a few times and i had to restart my vista computer at least twice which wasnt fun	0
the rate plan is also extremely good at least for me	1
much cheaper than ipods	1
for price size and features you cant beat this	1
i can see a drastic difference between this monitor and dell ultrasharp in terms of contrast brightness and viewing angles	1
not plug and play dependent on id without fm or recording	0
the router has obviously problems with static ip addresses firewalls and numerous other programs	0
this system is very powerful	1
the sound quality has been poor since day one the base constantly drops calls and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base we can no longer use the ac adapter with the base or it turns off completely	0
even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
get it its worth it	1
overall i like the unit	1
the storage capacity is great for me	1
if you re looking for a quality tower speaker this is it	1
other than that this thing is great	1
the internal network still functioned but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem	0
slow to download and run certain programs good luck and hope my comments help	0
avoid this mode like the plague	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
however its x ray settings were acceptable for the photos i took	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works perfectly for me but many people complain that it is bulky and difficult to operate	1
seriously this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
i have looked at many different models of monitors since i was a college student and this one has worse picture quality than any i have seen	0
the keyboard is a decent size but the power switch is small and hard to press	0
newbies will find that the fully automatic setting will give them the perfect picture out of the box	1
this was very prompt standard shipping service	1
i do nt think that really matters though i mean hooked my xbox up to the standard vga port a little while ago and the picture was awesome	1
it has an x ray zoom which is about average for these cameras	0
the service from the vendors was excellent	1
the only thing missing from the creative department was a cd burner	0
i use this with a home theater system and it is amazing how it sounds the picture clarity is unmatched	1
so yes like all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
the cameras features are stunning	1
the speakers are loud and clear with some nice extras such as a currency converter and stopwatch	1
it does get quite hot and should have plenty of room for air circulation	0
im a little disappointed at the low end	0
the move to add memory options is perfect with windows home professional installed otherwise other netbooks with windows starter wouldnt allow it and no one mentioned it	1
bright visible screen	1
it does have a lens cap but it wont let you take really good pictures with it	1
on several longer sections of the same route it didnt work	1
after just one month of use i couldnt play any dvds	0
the resolution is very good and the colours are bright and even changeable	1
the zooming lever is shaky i hope it does not operate mechanically otherwise you ll feel uneasy	0
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technician because i gave all the information i could	0
unfortunately it doesnt play all dvds	0
some features in the user interface	0
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
as a whole the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
i quickly ran into problems getting the player to recognize my two favorite dvds	0
you re going to need to buy new headphones the stock ones suck	0
creative are the sound people for computers i can t understand why eax would introduce static	0
it sounded great in the yard or on my nightstand	1
the gb zen xtra rocks my socks spills my beer but does nt wash my car	1
navigation can be done better but once you get used to it theres nothing zen xtra cant do	0
the scroll wheel is finicky it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right new users say they have success rate some find it so frustrating that they just return the device	0
the is a very durable compact package and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
the sound level was also not as high as i expected	0
people also have complained about the case not having a window but that is not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
image sharpness is excellent and i did a lot of work in photoshop with the mb original image file and quickly noticed the difference	1
the only thing i m concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	0
the sounds were as the movie directors intended	1
overall its a very compact camera that allows us to experience photography on a whole new level	1
too difficult to change genre album track information for large number of tracks	0
the picture freezes and the family shouts dad theres something wrong with the dvd player come quickly	0
my overall experience with this monitor was very poor	0
no dead pixels on mine	1
the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it	0
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
it is more than days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	0
i bought a jukebox that burned out while charging and they asked me for dollars to look at it and said they would charge me to fix the damn thing	0
very easy to set up	1
in the short time mentioned this model router has failed me twice	0
if you want to rename a cd title youve already transferred youll quickly become frustrated	0
the combination of price storage size and player features makes this the best player on the market	1
minor complaints even though the music is sorted via id tag on the player the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable	0
for a small portable unit this allows you to listen to as well as share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate setting	1
i love my phone very much	1
after a few months of use it no longer recognizes anything	0
huge storage space even at kbs you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
one piece of good news is that it has gb of disk space	1
no hope products no hope companies and no hope customer support	0
it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better better	1
very good price	1
despite being connected and showing that the player is in the library there is still no way to randomly recognize the player	0
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait is worth it	0
overall i like the features and performance of the system	1
its small and nice when downloading game pictures and ringtones from www crazycellphone com	1
this thing is great i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old track records	1
on the positive side once you configure everything the player will sound really good	1
the screen is bright and the ringtone is infinite	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	0
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	0
the screen is large and easily read	1
over all a fantastic very compact camera which made us experience photography on a totally new level	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
the sound quality is very good	1
no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones	0
this means theres a good chance the phone wont break as easily as a typical american phone	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
i bought my canon g about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied	1
i think this is it is biggest flaw	0
best electronic i ve bought since i was born	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	0
the backlight on the phone goes off too quickly and theres no way to change that	0
volume level is ok	1
these monitors are great for the price	1
finally making playlists from computers can be complicated as tracks are listed individually and organized by cds which are not listed but organized alphabetically	0
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
however it failed to deliver quality	0
sometimes the system would hang so i had to reboot the router and run it again	0
the router does drop calls from time to time but not about once an hour like the old router	0
but ive emailed creative tech support and got a prompt response and theyll sort it out for me if necessary	1
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing	1
this doesnt bother me too much as its still a decent size	1
honestly i love this player	1
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers	0
i will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
one complaint is that the screen scratches too easily	0
the software isnt good either and the drivers have problems using other very dumb sound bully products	0
i love the bass this thing gets i have two subs in my car that should tell you enough if i am saying the bass is great	1
i dont see myself having any problems in the next year or two but if i did i would know that with this product its taken care of free and quickly there are helpful and polite customer service reps and amazons service allowed me to get this project faster than i expected which is exactly what i know	1
still im willing to overlook these things because the unit looks stylish and has a myriad of features	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
for a small portable device this allows you to listen to and share ipod music and podcasts in an intimate environment	1
you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder	0
i m not easily impressed by electronics tending to be a little conservative but this product really deserves five stars	1
amazon is happy to pick it up the next day and pay for return shipping	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
on the plus side the phones battery life is excellent	1
i needed three batteries to keep the s running but the gs battery is the real power	1
the sound is excellent the battery life is excellent the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent and finally the price cheaper than the gb ipod is excellent	1
this replacement is even worse than the original product that works well now	1
difficult navigation i wo nt necessarily say difficult but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate	0
finally i reiterate my negative assessment of t mobile as a carrier	0
good battery life	1
my only complaint is like others here it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it is really annoying when it does because it does it so often	0
so sit back relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can and for a fraction of the price	1
the viewfinder doesnt show clearly	0
im not a web browsing person so this phone easily meets and exceeds my needs	1
its annoying when you pay for a router and it does nt work as it is supposed straight out of the box	0
paying a higher price than the routers amazon currently sells at lrb prices due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expecting to get a quality product these random disconnections are fatal to me	0
the sound from the player is ok	1
it wo nt play of my movies which are all store boughten	0
the lens cap design is also flawed	0
there is no firewire directly connected to the camera	0
price	1
despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality i experienced a flaw using eax	0
loading cds is somewhat time consuming but i assume the same is true of ipods	0
its the best dvd player ive ever bought	1
this is one of the best phones nokia has ever made	1
its great to switch to point metering and see it in action on the lcd screen	1
the mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars	1
replacement battery compared to ipod	1
it was worth the wait because ag neovo is standout monitor has all this and more	1
customer service and tech support are overloaded and dont respond by telling you about the quality of their product and their willingness to support them	0
the main problem with the nomadic jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
i also couldnt understand why the software didnt ignore the cds when alphabetizing them	0
when trying to get service from apex nothing the situation was the same as everyone else	0
crunchy	0
scene mode works for remaining shots that arent in regular settings	1
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps could nt play all my dvds and now the player can t play everything	0
it would continue to spin and then show up on the display that there was no disc	0
the device has worked flawlessly for the past year	1
when you turn on your player the player turns on really fast and the music continues to play as you left it when you were turning it off	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day	0
i ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	0
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
the mechanics of the players are also flawed	0
i m not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
i will never buy a creative product again	0
bought the gb xtra a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been excellent	1
in short its cheaper than an ipod and in my opinion a better choice	1
it either doesnt play the song at all or regardless of whether its on my desk or not jumps around like crazy	0
now that ive got all my music on it there wont be any more problems	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue was nt as easy as i would have liked	0
there are good features for the money apex machine	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos	1
while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
video output stopped workin	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
on the positive side the sound of the player is pretty good once you have everything configured	1
it worked perfectly during the installation of cx	1
the pc syncing feature in the nokia pc suite software is excellent	1
great storage capacity	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the player is not plug and play requiring nomad explorer and mediasource to be installed first to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping music files into it	0
fast syncing doesnt do any good because it either needs to be configured correctly or isnt very useful	0
overall an excellent phone	1
every once in a while the player would hang up on the file transfer and prompt for a reset	0
the speakers have very rich sound and good bass also obviously not pounding bass you need a huge subwoofer	1
so far i have no complaints and i would advise anyone who wants quality over appearance as well as anyone who wants a hard drive based mp player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
these controls are nowhere near as good as the simple ipod	0
apex is a solid performer for me	1
this phone has some minor inconveniences but only because it lacks these features bluetooth and high consumption internet but there are very few issues with what you would expect this phone to do	0
i only have one complaint and that is the mb card included	0
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out i ll consider purchasing one more of these super displays	1
speed tests showed that the wireless speed was comparable to my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
the design and construction is excellent as is the quality of nikon optics legendaries	1
some of my work authors own g and highly recommend canons picture quality	1
ill tell you about my own experience but the router waited to go back to the store so i never got far enough to try	0
i called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware but this did not solve the problem	0
no one sells a mm x mm sized lrb or what ever stupid size it is rrb power adapter	0
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight that illuminates the screen better than the nxs green backlight	1
the device is small and well designed i would recomment it highly	1
i was pleased with the camera	1
now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i m no annie lebovitz but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
for some time it also seemed to have a strong whiff of new electronics	0
the picture editing software it came with is adequate but not very robust	0
having usb makes for very fast transfers	1
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise	1
although the positive features of my mobile phone are good sound quality and excellent fm phone and headphones	1
solid resistant to scratches better heat dissipation	1
the included eax support is sometimes useful especially if you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
the only thing i find i dont like is that the lcd is hard to read during the day but so is everyone else	0
best electronics ive ever bought in my life	1
mature canon build quality and lens	1
no one selling a mm x mm size lrb or any silly size is an rrb power adapter	0
easy pairing	1
the sound quality is excellent except maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
megapixel is plenty for anyone and the photo quality is fantastic	1
however it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips	0
then sorting the files is easy	1
meanwhile the instructions for apple users indicated i should load the cd rom but it turns out it only contained a pdf of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for apple computers	0
main dial is not backlit	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	0
the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad	1
while i like the performance of this phone on all fronts i would buy another just because of its apparent non destructive nature	1
i give it a rating of stars for looks	1
i do nt want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible	1
i once used the speakers for nearly two hours and the battery didnt even drop a bar	1
after we discovered the problems we tried to contact apex but we never got in touch with them the customer support telephone number is always busy and they do not answer their web customer support	0
overall great speaker	1
although the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to result in a good product	0
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	0
when you turn the player on the player will quickly turn on and the music will continue playing just as it did when you turned it off	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and when we got to chapter the frames started to freeze for no reason	0
playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists	1
the changing colors help to be visible at a glance	1
the accompanying instructions dont explain how to make things easy	0
fixing speaker cables why do this	0
i use it for ripping cds which it does a pretty good job of	1
apex ad runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw	1
the software was great as long as you have an adminstrative user account	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance	1
the nokia was my first non clamshell phone and im glad i decided to use it	1
avoid this model like the plague	0
after enabling it whenever we made changes to the router we had to manually press the open radio button on the front of the router because the gui was not working	0
headphones arent the best but you really get a lot out of the little headphones you plug into your ear cavity	0
usb network storage supposedly it is slow	0
the sound is pretty good also lrb although not anything like a surround system rrb there is reflection but i only really notice it when the display is off in which case you see you own reflection on the screen	1
i remain extremely pleased with this router	1
fm receiver it has none	0
fm radio is cool	1
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
this thing is trash	0
i did a lot of research and decided to use this phone because it has a small size speaker a well priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
it exceeded my greatest expectations for an mp camera	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
others may have better luck but i have never seen a flat panel with such horrible viewing angles	0
very simple to use	1
i couldnt be happier that i bought this camera	1
i ve had it for about weeks and it is the best player i ve seen and used ever	1
with the smooth knob i find it hard to judge if i am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone	1
looks like a good product	1
i bought this monitor from computer direct a few months ago and so far im very happy with it	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
the switch negotiates the speed well and provides the gigabit ethernet link for the router	1
the photo editing software that comes with it is adequate but not powerful enough	0
the camera is constantly autofocused in auto mode accompanied by a buzzing sound that cant be stopped	0
the sound quality is amazing and its really great to have it with you instead of piles of cds or tapes	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything just open up explorer again	0
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
i gave zen star because it is an excellent profession and it would be inappropriate to judge it based on players in different professions	1
very easy to set up	1
the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall	1
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems	1
this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
x zoom is nice	1
from day one the sound quality has been consistently poor the base station drops frequently and now the base station seems to be short circuiting of some sort and we can no longer use the ac adapter or it will shut down completely	0
as always amazons super fast shipping items arrived in good condition	1
what really made this a mediocre mp player for me was the software	0
i currently have over files on my playlist and random does a great job of mixing them up	1
overall this is an outstanding phone	1
i fully expect it to go bad again in the next few months in the same or other way because as other commenters have pointed out the structure is quite fragile	0
very good range and seems better in horizontal positions	1
i was shocked and amazed by the quality of the raw images i got from this camera and could easily live with the cameras limitations as id never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
even leaving it on the default setting produces crystal clear playback	1
great quality picture and features	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg format which allowed me to stack movies on a dvd but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper	1
the router failed today lrb completely dead rrb when i need to work from home due to heavy snow	0
for those of us that like to tinker i think creative offers some advantages	1
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
well flash photos are never great and there was still a lot of noise	0
so easy to set up had some problems with my archos	1
the colors and everything are great	1
frame freezes and the family yells dad somethings wrong with the dvd player come quick	0
the phone is sound quality is great i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my is voice dialing	1
mms technology combines very well with this phone and youll love it	1
theres no way the batteries provided will last more than a few hours	0
daytime photos are excellent if your subject is no more than feet away and indoor shots are excellent	1
canons raw image software wont show you the raw image at all but rather the raw image processed with all the image impact settings in the camera	0
the sound quality is great	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the buttons seem a little sticky and the hands free kit connector could be an issue	0
great features	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
i am very pleased with my new speaker	1
these speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up	1
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
this stuff is amazing and i love using it to clean up stains on my countertop and listen to my old records	1
seemed like a good deal but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes no disc	0
no matter the format	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
however if what you need is speed reliability and the ability to transmit signals around the house then this router will do the trick	1
beautiful	1
the case is strong and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
im sure it will be useful in different settings where you just have to turn the volume up to a whisper	1
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
it also has great coverage through our two story house	1
its so much heavier and so much bigger that unless youre using it on your run or carrying it in your pocket it doesnt seem like a big deal	0
the operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the windows home professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with windows starter doesnt allow and nobody mention this	1
there are many other features in this phone and this is just one of the features above that i find most beneficial	1
the more i work with it the more i love it	1
a little weighty but otherwise fine	0
but if you want to know what i think of the apex dvd player i love it	1
i was very impressed with this dvd player	1
for the price it is a well spent investment	1
billy joel wasnt kidding when he said you get more bang for your buck from a cheap pair of speakers	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	0
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible	1
i wont go into the details here as the website reviews are already deep enough but i was very pleased with the cameras features speed picture quality flexibility automation and functional convenience	1
while my laptop and netbook have decent speakers the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers making it harder to hear some audio	0
as a portable player it should feel a bit more durable	0
ive had this player since christmas and absolutely love it	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority shutter priority and manual modes	1
unfortunately its a one off	0
poor visibility on the keys	0
there is a jvc system from many years ago and i think its good but the enbridge sound is amazing	1
on dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	0
the product is too fragile to be used properly	0
in terms of features and price i find nikon to be the best camera	1
i think apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
but after a few days the sound worked but the video stopped working	0
they shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot fairly well	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	0
the aff function does a good job of converting the letterbox to fill the screen and the images still look normal	1
the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	0
the controller is on the side not the front which i prefer because thats where my thumbs go when i hold something	1
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found it to be a huge improvement	1
usb transfer is insanely fast	1
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb is the software	0
it has very good range much better than the linksys router it replaced	1
the size is small	1
the screen may be a little smaller but its highly readable and theres no overuse of blue	0
i took a chance with this new product and am pleased except in six months it will cost half of what i paid but that is the price for current state of the art	1
it doesnt come with firewire which isnt really a complaint since most windows users dont usually have firewire cards themselves	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get the nomad	1
lots of sound options has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
on my main computer the software doesnt work properly	0
thanks to its complex features the menu is easy to access and the quality of the features is good	1
i paired this very easily to two different android phones	1
some people have a problem with the flip switch that releases the player cover at the bottom which isnt a problem for me and it doesnt matter if you use the cover switch	1
anything this phone does it does perfectly	1
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	0
multiple playback modes songs in album order etc are standard on all jukeboxes but its worth noting that the zen xtra doesnt lack in this regard	1
ive been using this monitor for a few months now without any problems	1
this router is phenomenal	1
i found it easy to use unlike audigy nxs remote interface	1
the sound quality is very good except that it can be a little too soft when there is a quieter speaker on the other end of the line	1
i have over files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing	1
change the key	0
there is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver	0
i purchased a jukebox it got fried while being recharged they asked for usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing	0
its easy	1
the software mediasource cannot work on my pc	0
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
the sound quality is excellent the unit looks cool screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod	1
great phone	1
my jpeg pictures can be viewed on my screen but they dont look as sharp as when viewed on my monitor	0
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was pretty painless	1
i like the player	1
the problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour if not more frequently	0
great camera and for the price you can t beat it	1
the screen is bright easy to see in daylight and the colors are good	1
both black and white speakers are economically priced and good value for money	1
the software on the router is pretty good	1
i hooked it up to my latest macbook pro and it worked perfectly	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too	0
do nt buy this monitor	0
the combination of the price storage size and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
very compact and portable and as described the sound quality is very good	1
im very happy with it so far	1
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck	0
and the sound well there is no complaints about that	1
buy this if you want quality products that deliver on time	1
the connection is not reliable and constantly dropped	0
what made me buy it was the critics who said it would play dvd rs fill files	1
usb means fast data transfers	1
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angle and best of all great price	1
otherwise this player is awesome	1
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain	0
the usb port on the back is a nice feature	1
working for hours with it on shuffle totally rocks	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	0
its by far the best camera ive ever used in its price category	1
ive been using this monitor for about a month now and im very happy with it	1
recently i bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card and as expected i was pleased to find that the picture quality of m ms fine combination of pixels is very good many user friendly features are very similar to those of dslr models and with the convenience of a digital camera you can see the picture instantly	1
ringtones are only accompanied by crazy songs and annoying ringtones with only one ringtone sounding close to a normal ringtone	0
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does nt seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	0
the manual does a good job of filling in any gaps	1
some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch	1
i m not very happy with this machine or acer	0
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
size bigger than the ipod	0
transferring music to your player using usb is very simple	1
so yes as with all software bundled with creative products it was useless and ugly	0
in many ways this is the best one yet	1
my fiance ordered this computer she is a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her	1
for my grandmother its easy to use	1
bottom line is for the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the included headphones are very comfortable and easy to use	1
the features are really cool like the radio	1
it comes in great color and the price is great	1
it was worth it	1
the final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap it is only a trial version you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional to some unknown company to unlock all the features	1
it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand	1
only con i can think of is no camera	0
the colors and contrast are exactly what i want	1
take excellent photos	1
they do look cool in the dark though	0
the g has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
exasperated i call it out and will send this horribly deceptive product back	0
there are no signal loss issues unlike the netgear router it replaces which only lasted a few months	1
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on percent of the time it sais shutting down which means i have to turn off and turn it on again which is not to my likings	0
despite a slight disappointment i highly recommend the canon g to anyone who takes digital photography seriously	1
it was made of plastic	0
it works great	1
you can also assign special ringtones and patterns to special people when they call	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier	1
the range is great upstairs downstairs outside or in the basement of four bars all the time	1
the g looks like a work of art	1
mid range is nt the best but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend on computer speakers	0
clear image	1
vocals have greater clarity with the ihome as well	1
it will just spin up stop and show no disc	0
i really like this netbook	1
it is slightly lighter than the g and packed with even more features	1
its light enough to carry around all day without being disturbed	1
very convenient to scroll through menus etc	1
i get complete coverage in my house which is located in the corner of my basement	1
for those of us who like to tinker i think being creative offers some advantages	1
top notch sound	1
after seeing and hearing my tour pop speakers i was convinced	1
i love this monitor	1
what i didnt like was the poor sound quality of the music at low volume	0
the subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned all the way down but it is all right because these are computer speakers	0
while nokia is a little short on features it is a brilliant piece of hardware that fulfills its original purpose as a wireless phone	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells that this machine can use	1
the software mediasource wont work on my computer	0
the zennx will continue to operate like any other battery powered device at a replacement battery price	1
battery life is amazing	1
im so happy with these that id probably buy more for the front channels	1
by holding the shutter halfway down and getting the settings ready to shoot i was able to take excellent stop motion shots that differed from other reviewers	1
this did nt bother me too much because it is still a decent size	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	0
i was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup	1
image clarity is great lrb i do a lot of work in photoshop with mb raw image files and noticed the difference immediately rrb	1
for the first few weeks this player was everything i expected it to be an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
however you do get the solid product you pay for	1
the color screen is a plus sign because it is a chord tone	1
pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	0
when i see a lot of plastic where there is metal i worry that the sound wont be as good	1
this camera was affordable very easy to learn and produces spectacular images	1
anyways back to the point i ve tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with acer and their terrible service and support	0
anyway it didnt work the way it was supposed to so were returning it we purchased this router for our two computers	0
bigger than an ipod	0
it allows the usb port on the router to be used for nas or print servers	1
its transparent	1
to my disappointment it doesnt seem to read certain dvds	0
id love to make this product work but it just doesnt	0
the second complaint in about a few months since we purchased this batch of monitors has been returned for repair or replacement	0
much faster than my previous single processor acer one netbook	1
hooked it worked like a charm great picture bright colors and very light weight	1
i personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets	1
the price was the lowest i d seen in my research lrb best buy office depot rrb	1
it has an fm radio option and i can listen to music whenever i want	1
it has a beautiful design a lot of features are very easy to use very configurable and customizable and the battery duration is amazing	1
apex is the best cheap premium brand for dvd players	1
im so bored with netgears product quality customer service that i would never recommend netgear products to anyone i know	0
ease of use many reviews mention this	1
i got it today it works great great sound for its size and price i understand that the volume for iphone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so i do nt complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iphone i highly recommend this tower	1
you can manage your profile by changing the contrast of the backlight to make different types of display lists or tabs	1
this speaker does the same wonders for my low end ht setup	1
so far the router is working well	1
even better using optional headphones you can enjoy music through the built in radio	1
the sound from the subwoofer is fantastic and the volume is extremely high	1
its very solid to build on and has a nice dense feel	1
i think the real reason for making these changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model the nx and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx is green backlight did	1
excellent metering options	1
valet plus is easy to configure and set in about minutes	1
however the creative software is not real intuitive	0
when i first tried it i found no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media discs played by other players but to my surprise i could play the cheap media i had burned which i hadnt been able to work on anything before but the dvd burner i made the discs on itself	1
what i do nt like is that at lower volume music listening tonal qualities are very poor	0
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much	1
creative media source while not looking as stylish as windows mediaplayer can organize your collection effectively and link to a good cddb service	1
this apex model doesnt work with my universal remote	0
i bought this to use on my truck and am happy with most of it it is loud and super easy to set up but you will want an amp for me	1
ive been buying it for a week now and the camera has exceeded my expectations	1
because this camera is beautiful	1
color screens are good	1
i usually avoid horns but i havent heard anything too extreme	0
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great i love this phone	1
this is a great player until the video output no longer works	0
its slightly lighter and has more features than the g	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
well within days the video output quit working	0
it seems like routers get better with every firmware release	1
please a firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals and be able to drag and drop upload attach etc	1
also for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video with lots of color bleeding compared to a component connection	0
my dwl ap cannot be used as a repeater for di and there are no firmware updates to support the product	1
ive been distracted by the highlights on s and g which seem only slightly better	0
i ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy	1
lrb yes just like you will be using a new very expensive dsl modem as a matte bridge rrb i returned the merchandise and got a linksys dsl modem	0
but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street	1
i researched a number of different mp players before asking for a zen xtra just for christmas but settled on this one and now that i have it i am very happy and i am convinced that it is the best one	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
audio is great	1
ive used this monitor for years and now it shows all sorts of colours and blurry text	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players that can play just about everything	1
heres a brief synopsis the phone is small slightly plastic like to the touch but looks solid	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	0
when you put this phone in your pocket youll forget its there its incredibly small and very light	1
i am ripping my cd collection into kbps wma files this gives an average of around mb per cd good for about cds in the mb of free memory available to me	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
the macro mode is exceptional the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
this product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx to my toyota camry mode	1
i bought this set it up and wont connect at wireless n speed	0
to my surprise even this process is error prone	0
despite the things ive listed i can live with it because it keeps me from lugging my cd case to the gym in my car	1
or maybe netgear messed up the firmware of this device so much that it didnt know what to do	0
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics	0
still i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features	1
headphones suck i would buy some cool headphones because it has eax capability	0
i havent read anything about how to operate it its just intuition	1
the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk	0
i love my new nomad its great	1
price along with the replaceable battery were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
they could be more comfortable but no complaints in the sound department	1
if i had to rate these speakers based on my listening needs id give them one star but i do it because i think they do the job that most people want them to do	1
i love my new nomad its great	1
first of all the sound quality of this player is superior to the ipod	1
you can do so much more with pc kits such as free ringtones in midi files free pictures in any picture on your computer or even make your own app games if you know how to program jme	1
sure it has all the features but when im trying to film a girls basketball game its just trying to get the job done	0
last night i needed to reset the router	0
you ca nt that upgrade is irreversible	0
with it enabled anytime we made changes to the router we had to manually press the turn on radio button on the front of the router because the gui one would nt work	0
i guess that limited lifetime warranty means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty	0
however creative software is not really intuitive	0
if i were to rate these speakers on my listening needs i would give a stars but i m giving because i think they do the job that most people want them for	1
i just like the feature	1
removing the front panel is very easy and there is only one way to insert the battery	1
but i have played it on dvd and had problems watching movies the picture would freeze but the dvd would still play and eventually the picture would recover a few minutes after skipping	0
this phone is one of the few with a built in fm radio tuner	1
i m easily enlarging pictures to x with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet	1
it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone and downloadable java apps	1
to me kbps wma files sound just as good as source cds and zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
regardless of format	1
unfortunately after loading songs all i get now is player either not connected or busy	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
the netgear router was simple to set up and worked well for the first few months i owned it	1
if youre not fussy about image quality go for it	0
i loved it until it broke but less than a month is an unacceptable amount of time to work	0
reviews of sound quality are generally positive	1
beautiful home theater and music speaker crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass	1
i have returned my ad to apex because it cannot play certain disney and other dvd movies	0
my fiance ordered this computer and shes a teacher so she needs a small computer so she doesnt have to bring her work home	1
in the end i felt that the lrb speakers i got were overpriced unless there were some inherent rrb benefits in the bose label that i wasnt aware of	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
the problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around mb s even when in the same room	0
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd is to play	1
loudspeaker amp	1
try contacting apex by email but the email address is invalid	0
it feels like plastic is cheap it feels like it breaks easily and definitely wont withstand a drop	0
this is the best phone ive ever seen	1
this unit was working fine for the st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	0
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
i ve had this for months now and i am pleased with my decision	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
i thought this was just the player but then i started checking the disc and found that the apex was actually destroying my media	0
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and it is a bit slow between shots	0
i have this connected to my late macbook pro and it works flawlessly	1
its a little heavy but otherwise good	0
ive been using it to play minecraft and multitask at the same time and while its slower when multitasking the gaming experience hasnt suffered for me	0
heck its easy to go online and tweak it there	1
bookmarks for example are a nice feature but not on this player	0
not only is it the perfect size but it has all the features that high tech phone users want	1
also the player sometimes freezes not a very big problem but can also be annoying	0
way less expensive than the ipod	1
navigating in this device is very simple	1
simply put the canon g is the best digital camera at this price point right now	1
i bought the sleek phone and i couldnt be happier	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
i was impressed with the cameras ease of use	1
i wanted the product to work soo bad but it just did nt	0
this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can t be stopped	0
the price is very good	1
i was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both	1
nothing but hassle with this company	0
i unreservedly recommend the powershot g to any potential buyer looking for a top notch digital camera at a reasonable price	1
i hadnt even used my new dvd player yet and i was already disappointed	0
b this is lame	0
very long lasting battery life	1
overweight woofers are big	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
i cant forget to take my cd collection with me wherever i go	1
but the sound is very good and works well on my portable speakers	1
i just set it up manually which is very easy	1
even better you do nt have to worry about constantly replacing batteries	1
the build quality feels solid the disc doesnt shake or whine when played and the graphics and sound are top notch	1
get it it is woth every penny	1
feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
fragile	0
you can not get decent mid range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took	1
but to me its perfect	1
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
this is a superb camera and good value for money	1
another problem is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
the standard battery that comes with the g is a camcorder battery that allows me to take pictures all day without worrying about recharging	1
many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player	0
after multilple tries one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	0
i bought the phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software began to bog it down so much so that i had to reset it and my computer frequently to restore a dropped internet connection	0
also i can t understand why the software does not ignore the when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	0
another benefit is that napster now supports the device through their software	1
also the player sometimes freezes which isnt a huge problem but its annoying	0
the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint	0
in general indoor photos taken with flash are not as good as mm ones	0
the bottom line does a good job of making the camera easy to use with very flexible and powerful features including the ability to use an external flash and a choice of lens filters	1
i wish theyd turned it up a bit	0
player has a problem with dual layer dvd is such as alias season and season	0
its annoying when you spend money on a router and it doesnt work properly	0
it has good power but its not accurate at all	1
shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up	1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
the first set i received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned	0
i called tech support and they helped me install the new firmware but that didnt fix the problem	0
i got great photos of the july fireworks gala and some great shots of the kids playing with them	1
this camera is great value for money and i highly recommend it	1
sure it had all the features but when i tried to shoot a girl is basketball game it just want up to the task	0
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
i found it to be a great feature	1
this camera is great for operating in automatic mode and is also very flexible in aperture priority shutter priority and manual mode	1
lightweight	1
i think the apex is the best dvd player you can get for this price	1
as i mentioned before the creative media source software is actually very powerful despite what anyone says although notmad might still work better	1

ive only been buying this thing for a little over a month and the headphone jack is already loose	0
i love the storage in this thing	1
the sound quality is great and i really like the smart volume sound normalisation	1
the device itself is very sturdy	1
i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	0
when it came time to buy a mobile phone i was determined to get a nokia phone because it was the best of the phones	1
this product is impossible to beat at any price	1
i bought three of these acer from amazon at a very good price and we are very happy with the sharpness and sharpness	1
the larger lens of the g gives better picture quality in low light and the times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f	1
just received the camera two days ago and already like its features	1
im tired of the silver look	0
i tried called apex cust service no help	0
in other words zen isnt a convenient data storage device just buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
one good thing it is gb of disk space	1
great camera great investment	1
it makes up for this is very easy to use and the well designed controls can be learned quickly	1
when i turn on the phone the first thing i think about is how good the screen is	1
after nearly pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack	0
very simple to use	1
i chose the g because it is known for its high quality clear images	1
these are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park	1
now when the backlight fails i have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day	0
besides i hate widescreen monitors	0
this router is the best i have used to date	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was nt complicated to learn at all	1
it is an extremely cool gizmo	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the rigor of a business traveler	0
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
tech support hotline on the other hand buffalos tech support hotline is very helpful	1
i like the automatic key lock function	1
i m very pleased with my zx so here is a quick review	1
it is also a bit bigger than expected but that is ok because all i need is something to work with my iphone	0
i tried several times to contact apex digital through their online support site and phone line but they wouldnt answer my emails and their phone line was always busy	0
the screen is large defined and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
at the very least a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	0
what a disappointment	0
fixed speaker cable why do this	0
chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
flash as with the built in flash on all small cameras you will see the subject overilluminated and lose depth	0
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before	1
the menu options lack creativity because you cant see the full screen menu items and you have to scroll up and down to find what youre looking for	0
this wonderful product was easy to unbox and install	1
now that ive had the camera for two months im even happier with it	1
if it doesnt play some of your actual dvds forget the glossy exterior	0
its silver magnesium finish is stunning and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen	1
it works well	1
although the nokia is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
i spent hours on them and i couldnt connect to the internet	0
things are much more distinct and i do nt have to strain my eyes and squint when i am trying to read something on the screen lrb like i had to do with my clunky old monitor rrb	1
the excellent picture quality is on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
all and all i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
my wife is happier because of the widescreen	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
however it has failed to deliver on quality	0
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	0
i bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago and i have been very satisfied with it so far	1
its easy to navigate though i prefer more solid buttons beyond the thumb wheel scroll button	1
mediasource is not installed on my personal laptop	0
we have purchased universal remotes that so far all claim to work with apex dvd players and do not work	0
the sound is great and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
awesome sound system	1
i tried to email apex and they said it was undeliverable	0
overall a sweet machine	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select you have to push straight in or it sticks	0
i agree with previous reviewers who said that vertical viewing angles are very limited in order to get consistent contrast	0
the customer support is very rude	0
as a portable player it should be a little more durable	0
the replacement unit had a problem too the little switch on the bottom was nt working properly making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area	0
also my tote covers the display so even with access to the controls on the side i have to turn it on to see the display	0
theres only one complaint about the hands free microphone you can only activate the hands free microphone feature when the other person answers the phone not when it rings	0
at the time of my purchase this was the cheapest inch monitor i could buy	1
this camera boasts canons excellent chroma plus what you see on the lcd is what you get	1
the battery is nice	1
i was impressed with the design specifications and price	1
this is my first digital camera and what a toy it is	1
i have this monitor for a month now and i m very pleased with it	1
the unit works extremely well with my cassette adapter as my car is also easy to operate without taking eyes off the road	1
they have a whole bunch of equipment with the same sounding names	0
so now it still plays everything you just can t see it	0
nice and compact	1
as the reviews say they sound really good	1
for the money apex machines have good features	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
the sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca nt hear a thing	1
this is a nice feature i e it is early in the morning and you rather listen to easy listening rather than heavy metal no problem	1
creative zen feedback was affected by poor construction quality difficult product support use of rollers and fairly consistent feedback about the headphone jack issue	0
for the price its a worthwhile investment	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
you can do so much more with the pc suite i e free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps games	1
as a non technical person i was surprised that the cisco valet plus wireless hotspot was installed in less than a few minutes	1
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely	1
nifty little phone light case	1
my house is small so it is hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
this grain sucks	0
second gripe in the or so months since we purchased our batch of of these monitors have already been returned for repair or replacement	0
i couldnt be happier with the product and the price without any problems	1
great camera	1
im happy to have over gb of music stored on this baby as well as a few media files in the data folder	1
in that model the hard drive failed the morning before my class	0
while upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke	0
its easy but it doesnt work	0
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy	1
its lighter easy to carry and has plenty of features to go around	1
i only gave it a few stars because the first one shattered when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts and both were bad	0
the dvd player does not work properly	0
but if you are using an slr camera the controls are very intuitive	1
unfortunately the player wont read any of my area dvds even if they arent damaged in any way	0
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
usb means fast data transfer	1
i called apex is support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	0
i started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely slow	0
for one thing unlike sprint my calls were loud and clear	1
i dont think it really matters though i mean my xbox was connected to a standard vga port a while ago and the picture was great	1
system error issues a few days after purchase	0
quite bulky and uses a heavy battery although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic	0
there is always a bit of noise in filmed film editing and there is no avoiding that	0
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber in the corners	0
also it only seems to work if youre about five feet away from the player though that might just be the battery that comes with it	0
plus it comes with a stylish and powerful headset	1
overall it is the best camera on the market	1
the included earplugs werent so bad	1
the sound quality is very good	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
if youre looking for a high quality tower speaker this is it	1
also it was very easy to set up a route to my wamp server as the process was exactly the same as my old netgear	1
i quickly got used to the interface and could quickly find any song playlist etc	1
the door would not close	0
there are so many functions in this little yet powerful camera	1
i am quite happy having over gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder	1
whether you re taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you ll be glad you had the fm radio	1
i do like this phone overall but unforutnately i am returning it	1
both are very easy to learn and use and intuitive enough even for newbies	1
i was willing to live with the larger size but the durability was a big zero	0
lastly i feel that the speakers were over priced for what i got lrb unless there is some inherent benefit in the bose label that i do nt know of rrb	1
canon consistently does	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
this product is hard to beat at any price	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked works fine right out of the box	1
i have to say i was also impressed with the user interface for playing jpeg mp and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
p fantastic little computer does everything i had hoped for work study travel	1
i used it a lot without any problems	1
i havent had time to really push this player to the limit yet but the audio aspect of the nomad is satisfactory as expected by creative lab	1
you can adjust the volume so you can hear it anywhere so it doesnt cause too much disruption	1
in my opinion the size and design of the system is fantastic and looks even better than ipods	1
my attempts to call apex customer service did not help	0
i fell in love with this camera which combines ease of use with tons of options and features	1
the color is red and is so attractive	1
well the flash photos were never very good and there was still a lot of noise	0
even bass from such small drivers is very impressive	1
this is the best dvd player i ve purchased	1
when the matrox g dual dvi card comes out ill consider buying another one of these super monitors	1
in other words the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection	0
its smaller than i expected when i ordered it but the results are better	1
however when i plugged it into my mac mini the screen looked wonderful	1
the sound is clear and clean but you cant hear anything if youre not on it	1
great value gb vs gb ipod for the price	1
but i dont like hanging it on my belt because the clips arent secure and the case slips off	0
hands free speakers are very powerful	1
it also has no height adjustability so it sits low to the table	0
you can be up to about feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
this player seems to work well with everything else	1
advantages competitive cost to win home premium hdmi port lrb i can watch amazon instant video on my hdtv and its transfer is fantastic	1
theres also a nice guest feature that allows your visitors to connect to separate main links	1
simply click the button to return the button volume and the display is very easy to read to access and use	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture	0
customer service staff are very rude	0
i got this for christmas and it is a great gift	1
the software on the pc side can be silly and takes a bit of getting used to but its not as bad as some critics have suggested	0
this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
when i connect the device to my computer about of the time it cant find the device	0
the player usually plays dvds but occasionally has problems such as not recognizing the dvd stopping play at certain points in the movie each time it plays and not being able to access certain special features on rental dvds	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	0
both of the problem dvd is would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going	0
be prepared for a long wait lrb minutes rrb but the wait was worth it	0
the sound is fantastic as one would suspect from a creative product	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	0
the battery life is so long that i use it every day and have to charge it every other day or few days	1
either way can t go wrong with this price	1
very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality	1
just an average user getting a good value for this product	1
i did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under i m thrilled with my purchase	1
i highly recommend a nokia	1
reviews for sound quality are generally positive	1
anyway back to the point where ive been trying to keep my cool over the past month dealing with acer and its poor service and support	0
music organization is id based which can be a problem for old downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id information	0
the first routers worked good for years	1
it would spin read spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	0
receiving this product on time as a gift works extremely well with long battery life and good screen resolution using windows this is how the rest of the family uses connecting to my network is easy	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
canon is g does it consistently	0
i would not be inclined to buy an apex product again	0
the screen quality is very high the side view is very sharp clear	1
both are very easy to learn use and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
i was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow	0
i love the player and will probably choose creative labs again	1
the final insult is that while the router comes with useful software that makes sharing printers wirelessly a breeze its only a trial version and youll have to download the trial software from the internet and then pay an extra fee to some unnamed company to unlock all the features	1
ive had no problems at all so far and im happy	1
its easy to use but very feature rich	1
unfortunately after loading the song what i get now is that the player is either not connected or busy	0
bright vivid clean lines wide viewing angles and best of all affordable	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
t is which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
its a very good player especially since the price and features can rival or surpass the ipod	1
battery life is ok	1
much has been said about the phones features in other reviews and its a great phone that came out of the box without any problems	1
sound quality is good	1
it was really easy to set up out of the box and i got all my wireless devices lrb laptops desktop and smartphones rrb connected to the internet in minutes	1
we own two sets of lrb black rrbs and im very happy with the performance of these compact speakers especially at the low price points sold on amazon	1
finally i bought this monitor for more than you can buy it in the us	0
for me its perfect and the quality of games and word documents is excellent	1
i d venture to say that because of it is low cost it is the best pc stereo set out there costwise	1
it did play dvd r which would not play on my older philips machine	1
it is easy to use and seems fully functional	1
first of all the player is sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
it would either not play the song at all or skip wildly no matter that the unit was resting on my desk	0
theres no way to contact their customer service	0
the setup is error proof and delivers a superior result	1
battery life seems good charging time is short mp uploads are quick and there is no lag between songs	1
for the price and size and features you can t beat the price	1
the prints are beautiful	1
the keyboard was also very good and very comfortable although it took some getting used to	1
i just received my gb zen xtra yesterday and i couldnt be happier with it	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours and then it died	0
conclusion i was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day i got them	0
the amazing little computer did everything i could hope for work study travel	1
i ordered it on a monday afternoon lrb around pm rrb and with no extra shipping costs the monitor was at my door in chicago by the time i got home from work tuesday	1
much faster than my previous acer one netbook with single processor	1
focusing on a display rack about feet away in a brightly lit room during day time pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	0
if you dont have tabs it will put all your songs in the same directory and they cant be searched by artist or album as zen doesnt recognize folders	0
the ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers	1
a well backlit keyboard	1
easy to use with clear instructions in the mounting drive	1
great sound very long battery life very fast recharges rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
the ihomes vocals are much clearer too	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
it has lots of cute little features my favourites being games pim and radio	1
halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar the infamous browser page not found screen replaced most of the router is interface	0
i find the apex ad to be a great buy	1
the screen is large and easy to read and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
like other reviewers installation is hell	0
its a nice feature that is its early in the morning and youd rather listen to relaxing music than heavy metal no problem	1
ive just hooked it up and everything seems to be going well	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound and the cd played well but the dvd only had sound and no image	0
great sound good interface replaceable powerful battery good software wake up sleep timers multiple play modes	1
overall i would recommend these to anyone who wants a small yet effective set of computer speakers for a reasonable price	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
first i would start by saying that the hardware of this player is pretty decent	1
it also has excellent coverage through our two story house	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
do what its supposed to do and the sound seems fine to me	1
but about of dvd is i ve played on ithave a problem when watching a movie the picture will freeze but the dvd still plays and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
that sounds good but i reckon youll probably get the quality youll get from a real line up jack	0
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price	1
changing brightness is easy with four presets and one user changeable lrb i leave that at minimum brightness for at night rrb	1
the software on the router is good	1
paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at lrb price depression due to poor quality no doubt rrb and expected to get a good quality product these random disconnects kills it for me	0
i gave it only stars due to the fact that the st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance	0
during the day in a brightly lit room focused on a display shelf about feet away the pictures taken by this camera are blurry and orange	0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is megapixel	1
most products will last if taken care of and logitech is products are no exception to this rule however since they are somewhat in fact a great deal more sturdy than my old radio	1
the volume range is great so you can blast it if you want	1
id rate it five stars if the manual wasnt so bad	0
this phone does everything perfectly	1
be very happy with the monitor and the price	1
my socks spilled my beer but didnt wash my car	1
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
be prepared to wait about a few seconds when its minutes at a time you change a submenu item and hit that dreaded apply button	0
it was beautiful while it lasted	1
second the menu system and controls are poorly designed	0
the photos are very sharp even in macro	1
but with low price comes low quality	0
even using my usb connection to rip songs is still fast and the quality is good	1
the only downside is that the speaker wires are thin	0
i hate apex but love amazon and i tell everyone	0
i ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s and the g seems to do only slightly better	0
it has never worked	0
sound quality and base is amazing	1
the camera also has a good feel and weight	1
i do nt always care for gracenotes genre listings but it allows easy editing of id tags	1
we tried the finding nemo dvd and by the time we got to the first chapter the picture started to freeze for no reason	0
overall small sounds great and less expensive than apple is overpriced ipod	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id tags that are embedded in the mp files to organize your songs	0
the switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a gige link	1
after we discovered the problem we tried to contact apex but we never got back in touch with them the customer support phone number was always engaged and they didnt answer their network customer support	0
the superdrive and wifi bluetooth modules are highly recommended	1
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub par	0
also it was only with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
however since im in the office i usually put them on very low volume and at low volume they sound a bit weak	0
other labeling issues come from nomads operating system	0
the connection was unreliable and frequently dropped	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front which i like because that is where my thumb is when i hold the thing	1
the canon computer software is great for downloading sorting uploading and managing your digital photos on your computer	1
it came back working and i was momentarily glad that the rumors i d heard about acer tech support did nt turn out to be true in my case	1
the computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast	1
advantages moderate price large storage capacity easy navigation can be modified at any time existing playlists have removable battery	1
you can also store data on it which is a benefit for everyone who wants to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod never mind its a better option	1
i have no complaints with this mp player	1
navigation could be better but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it	0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with rd party earphones and software	0
seriously this thing has everything a pro or amateur could want	1
despite this minor disappointment i highly recommend the canon g anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
all i can say is that this is an excellent devise	1
if you shake your hand a little during the whole process the picture will become blurry	0
with gb of storage i have about songs on the player with room for about more	1
this little speaker has dynamite sound	1
the typical problem for me and for many others is the headphone jack	0
i did nt read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does	1
they sound wonderful in my opinion and i have nt even touched any equalizers	1
the camera is affordable simple and easy to learn and the images taken are spectacular	1
great phone	1
changing the brightness was easy with four presets and a user changeable lrb i left at rrbs minimum brightness at night	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
progressive scan player for a relatively low price	1
this is the third apex product ive bought and they continue to impress with their prices	1
however calls to the d link support team were returned within a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features	1
wo nt play a lot of discs	0
great value for money gb with the price of a gb ipod	1
i find it too bright	0
i tried calling the support number for a week several times a day and always got a busy signal	0
its easy to turn it on and see what songs are you listening to	1
headphones suck i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
the remote works but it doesnt and youre standing there thinking what did you do wrong	0
its light weight and has good signal strength	1
i would have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker	0
it is easy to use and it seems feature complete	1
i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	0
the software which comes with player is not good at all	0
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night but dark enough so you wont go blind if you stare at the screen for too long	1
the larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it lrb could nt on the dell rrb and edit them	1
i sent my monitor in to acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random buzzing from my acer gd hz monitor	0
d link does not provide mac support for the adapter but i was able to find a compatible free rd party driver	0
most products last and logitechs are no exception because theyre actually sturdier than my old radios	1
they are very comfortable staying where they are and provide decent audio quality	1
the battery stays charged for an extended period of time fully charged for no more than an hour or more via the included ac adapter	1
dont buy this type of monitor	0
slow gui be prepared to wait approximately seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded apply button yes minutes	0
transfering is easy the software makes everythig pretty easy	1
it worked perfectly for about a week then the problem came	1
first of all the disadvantages are a bit bulky not the most aesthetically pleasing player and no support for folder structure	0
its sturdy and scratch resistant and dissipates heat better	1
but when we used it again there was sound but no image	0
once you actually find people the tech support is very enjoyable and helpful	1
i wouldnt mind having an externally adjustable antenna but it does a good job and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is greatly improved	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	0
excellent battery life beats the ipod	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle and wouldnt even be read at all	0
both units are small with similarly small speakers	1
it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims to do	1
sure i only used the dvd player for about a few hours to get my mum a christmas present but that was enough for me to find out what was wrong with the dvd player	0
the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now	0
i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while prompting a reset	0
it has good color and price was great	1
i am not to savy with a computer but the d link is very easy to install and set up	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
however some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down to the point where i was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped internet connection	0
it comes with a cover that doesnt quite fit	0
they claim to respond within an hour but havent done so in weeks	0
the light auto correction is awesome	1
easy to hook up	1
thuumbs gundam acer widescreen ultra thin monitor	1
great color display sharp picture and just the right size for my desk	1
the only downside i can think of is the lack of a camera	0
he died shortly after getting them	0
when i st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc is that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
i highly recommend it	1
i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics	1
excellent battery life hours beats ipod is	1
it works well too	1
anyway this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
this player is not worth much i suggest you dont buy it	0
my dad also has an apex tv which is another great value for money	1
this is an excellent value	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd is transferred	1
overall a sweet machine	1
this player has done perfect work for me and at this price you cant go wrong	1
this software sucks	0
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
had a jvc system that was years old and i thought it was good but the onkyo sound is amazing	1
key instead	0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
excellent heavy build quality and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture	1
still priced below the lowest level of ipods i was able to get this gb monster and the best part was that it worked because it was so big for advertising and then some	1
because this camera is beautiful	1
i especially love the remote controller stand with it is big volume knob and simple selector buttons	1
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive	1
folders cannot be created for the audio files	0
when i got it home i found that the menu option to send a message via text or email simply didnt exist	0
the reception and sound quality are superb	1
after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
you can be feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
materials are cheap	0
my two main needs were longer battery life and a lower price and i found both	1
both units are small and so are the speakers	1
i fell in love with this camera it combines ease of use with an immense amount of options and power	1
the screen is large and easy to read	1
there are plenty of downsides but the superior sound quality hd size and price make it worth it	1
its a little bigger in size than an ipod and weighs a little more	0
i find it much easier and quicker to load your songs into the nomad jukebox using mediasource than windows explorer	1
it has a heavier and sturdier shell	0
dont buy this player	0
the auto focus performs well but i love having the optional scene modes they are dummy proof and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
i highly recommend it	1
great sound very long battery life very fast charging rate removable battery storage size nice screen firmware updates and great price	1
it has a long battery life fm radio with excellent signal hands free speakers and downloadable java apps	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
otherwise the phone is highly recommended	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers and they both delivered great results	1
the color screen makes this free rebate phone shine with responsive commands	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
i will never use all the whistles and bells this machine is capable of	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
my house is small so its hard to gauge the true strength of the product through many walls but in my house the product works well in all rooms and corners with no signal interruptions	1
the sound quality is very good and i have no complaints about the phone the only thing i miss is voice dialing	1
the remote works but then it does not work and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	0
apparently t mobile is heavily back logged and can t keep up with demands	0
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
it would be better if it had a window so you could see the screen and if the buttons didnt cover the ac jack	0
even if you completely disable securespot it will continue to say that your computer is new on reboot even if it is not nt and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized	0
hopless product hopeless company and hopeless customer support	0
if you re looking for a small compact super resolution digital camera you can end your search with the nikon	1
of course i was hesitant given the price but since receiving it ive been so impressed that i bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
this dvd player is basically crap	0
its great when the players are working but	0
having unfilled id tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown	0
ive been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all its advertised to be	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a mp camera	1
the silver magnesium surface is stunning the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera ive seen	1
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is fantastic	1
not only is it the perfect size it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
no direct firewire to the camera	0
the sound quality is very good the device looks cool the screen is bright and easy to read and the replaceable battery means a big advantage over the ipod	1
d link support was more helpful this time and led me to the actual problem which was the routers inability to automatically negotiate ethernet link speeds from my fios fiber network block	1
software is easy to use	1
excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
perhaps the biggest advantage of the player is that users can replace the battery themselves by removing the cover and putting in new batteries	1
there were also issues with the replacement unit where the small switch at the bottom didnt work properly preventing me from choosing among the city forecasts for my area	0
those used to mm cameras will find the g very comfortable and friendly to use	1
after a week out of the box i began to see slight contractions on the screen from time to time and they became more frequent every day	0
one problem is that the reel doesnt work as well as id like	0
although your products are of superior quality your support is equal	1
navigating many of its features is easy and often obvious im no anne lebovitz but i was able to guess most of its features just by playing around in a camera store	1
overall i like the system features and performance	1
the buttons on the phone are tiny even for the tip of my little finger but you quickly get used to them	0
this small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most mp players including sansas and ipods	1
however for a budget i think this camera is a good choice	1
in short if youre just a slightly tech phobic person and you just want a router to surf the internet do basic networking work play mahjong and browse myspace all day this router is perfect for you	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle or not even be read at all	0
the toggle button for scrolling is poorly designed and does not work properly	0
bought gb xtra a few weeks ago and its been fantastic so far	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
the first one we installed did nt work and our kids were devastated to say the least	0
yes the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
the screen brightness is really good	1
as always super quick shipping by amazon items arrived in great shape	1
in addition it comes with a remote control	1
the sound is very clear and very low bass	1
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
the nikon coolpix is very user friendly high quality and small in size	1
choosing songs is much more difficult and its not easy to create playlists on the run like a new ipod not to mention that it doesnt play with contact lists phone numbers address books etc like an ipod does	0
this is my second creative labs mp player and it is definitely a fine product	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and it is not heavy	1
i knew it was a cheap monitor when i saw it	0
storage capacity	1
the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as a n wireless router	1
i purchased nomad jukebox zen xtra gb and it is amazing	1
like it is predecessor the quickly revised nx this player boasts a decent size and weight a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id tags and excellent sound	1
within a year there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
cons i think the satellite looks ugly	0
i agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast	0
i wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder	0
this is one of the nicest electronic devices that i ve ever owned	1
the case is sturdy and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
great features	1
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware at dd wrt is website and it resolved all my problems	1
the visibility of the keys was poor	0
transferring is easy and this software makes everything so easy	1
the changing colors help to tell with a quick glance	1
without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image	1
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	0
for example i made several backups of my dvd movies with dvd r and r which can play dvds	1
user replaceable battery	1
my first impression was positive	1
i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory as should be expected from creative labs	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	0
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures so i am very pleased	1
it couldnt play my movies which were store bought	0
this apex model will not work with my universal remote control	0
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
feedback on creative is product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen it applies to all the company is products	0
not only did it have trouble playing jpegs files it even had trouble playing dvd movies	0
the roller was finicky and worked most of the time but pressing it just right required a learning curve new users said they had a success rate and some found it so frustrating that they simply returned the device	0
the size is very small easy to fit in your pocket and wont bother you	1
the interface is so bad that some elements dont work at all	0
small size	1
well the theory was great but upon enabling the guest network things stopped working	0
i would venture to say that because of its low cost it is the best computer stereo in terms of cost	1
we own two sets of these lrb black rrb and i am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers especially at the low price these sell for here on amazon	1
equipment included is average but that is nt a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for	1
they deliver great sound when hooked up and actually receiving a signal	1
the only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin	0
i also didnt like the way it displayed information down in zoom mode	0
wow this speaker is really great	1
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	0
would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system	1
mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan and one came with a broken headphone and one died today after less than two weeks of use	0
i love the storage space inside here	1
so far it can play pretty much every media ive tested even old vcds i ripped up years ago and rental dvds that wont play on my old sharp player	1
the sound quality and fundamentals are amazing	1
the disadvantages are minor the feel and layout of the remote is only so so it does not display the full mp file name for very long filenames you have to loop through each zoom setting before going back to normal size	0
its one of the best electronic devices ive ever owned	1
my other big complaint about this monitor is the stand	0
ive had this player for months now and after the frustration and competition of getting the player to do its job ive been able to see all the dvds	0
i ve sent e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	0
in fact it caused my system to hang more times than not so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource	0
its a great camera for you	1
the speakers on the first tv i received made a loud noise and had to be returned	0
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi bluetooth modules	1
photos taken with digital zoom are just as good as those taken with optical zoom	1
it still fits in the palm of your hand and isnt heavy	1
i like the automatic keylock function	1
this stuff is garbage	0
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
uploading pictures to my windows computer is quick and easy	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
great speakers overall	1
the first one we installed didnt work and our kids were devastated	0
i m extremely glad i bought this camera	1
i ve been playing minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time and while it does run slower while multi tasking the gaming experience is not compromised for me	0
the quality is top notch	1
nice machines but i think their quality is pretty low now	0
for a specific location i still think its a great phone	1
i was impressed with this very cheap player for the first three hours and then it died	0
the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out you will be able to buy another easily	1
after i had it for a few weeks it got into a state where it couldnt find the device no matter how often i rebooted the computer reset the device reloaded drivers etc	0
but right now it seems to work very well and i dont see any problems with it	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s but the battery in the g is a real powerhouse	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
the interface used could have been better designed	0
im not computer savvy but d link is easy to install and set up	1
one beef is the scroll it does nt work as well as i d like	0
i think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses gpu hardware acceleration	1
the ad did nt work corectly from the start and the ad lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up	0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class	0
we are very happy with the squad leader and the company	1
now when the backlight malfunctions i have to unplug it overnight and it works the next day	0
please do a firmware upgrade to make all usb drives connected to this wireless router visible in the desktop portal of your local computer that is actually networked and able to drag and drop upload attachments etc	1
recent price drops have made the g the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
for the price of these speakers the sound that comes out is incredible	1
the day finally came when i knew for sure i wanted to leave sprint	0
the bottom line is i have a better set of speakers at creative lab and i trigger the speakers on my computer at least to my ear for less than half the cost	1
im very happy with my zx so heres a quick recap	1
the sound quality is excellent	1
the router is great but it only supports our existing xbox and youll never get much more than an open nat type when i do contact support others are usually mild or strict they were very nice and tried their best to make it work but to no avail the bottom line is if you only have one computer a laptop youll be fine and very safe this router is worth the money	1
although most critics rave about the quality of zens music i had a problem with the eax	0
it is small light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
looks fantastic esp w iphone docked	1
the only thing i dont like about it is that the cover sucks	0
value comparison of data storage versus price	1
great price for all the features	1
even works better on g band than the linksys	1
my guess is that the limited lifetime warranty means it can take a lifetime to collect warranties	0
conclusion i was prepared to pay shipping to return the speakers the same day i received them	0
battery life is ok	1
it is made of plastic	0
the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly	1
just an average user getting good value in this product	1
ive had it for about a few weeks now and its the best player ive seen and used	1
color screen is good	1
i find it very useful for moving large files to another computer	1
it played only one out of three dvd is without problems the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	0
sure it is a little bigger than the ipod but not by much	0
software the software is crap	0
they caused the problem ie wrong product in the box the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong	0
excellent range of metering options as well	1
my first impressions were positive	1
you cant say that upgrades are irreversible	0
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
acer has been awful to deal with they treat their customers like rubbish and have a miserable repair facility to match their products	0
bookmarks for example are an excellent feature but not on this player	0
they will not respond to my emails and the phone line is constantly busy	0
looks awesome esp w iphone docking	1
even after reading some of the instructions it is still hard to figure out	0
tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone	1
at first i tackled this problem because mbps was still very fast	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products which is very dumb	0
huge storage space i loaded my entire collection of music which isnt that much songs and still have gb out of the provided to you	1
while the sound quality is good it takes more than good sound on a portable mp player to be a good product	0
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next months because as other reviewers have pointed out the construction is pretty flimsy	0
its a bit of a hassle to navigate through so many levels to find the option you want	0
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality great features long battery life and an unbeatable price	1
it worked even better than the linksys on the g band	1
the sound quality is great	1
in summary i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
the only thing i care about is the quality life of the buttons on this thing	0
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light	1
the sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now	1
it seemed to connect to other machines much faster than my replacement router and with simple valet service it was a good product	1
also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link	1
they re pretty comfortable stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote which is worse than other cheaper apex units	0
at the end of the day what i want is a high capacity player that allows me to easily play any album in my collection wherever i go and the price capacity and features of the zen xtra easily meet those criteria	1
fortunately the g has a hot shoe that can take an external flash and fortunately for me i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the metz ct	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound	1
living in a small college apartment e and e are beautiful but a bit overqualified for me	1
at oz its fairly light but not as light as an ipod	1
despite the things that i have listed so far i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work to the gym in the car etc	1
the d link dir extreme n wireless router works fine as an n wireless router	1
the manual mode is easy to use and allows you to quickly choose shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options	1
my gut tells me that in the long run the nomad will be a gigabyte portable hard drive at best though i wont be able to create folders on it or at worst a very expensive lesson in the company never buying a product again	0
while i had the phone the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
mp is about right for the target market of this camera	1
now one more complaint i have about the g is the software that comes with it for handling raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i do is replace mbyte cf with mbyte cf which gives me raw images instead of	0
here is the brief synopsis the phone is tiny cute feels kind of plastic like but seems pretty sturdy	1
simple click buttons back buttons volume and display are very easy to read access and use	1
speakers radio all features work well	1
with gb of storage i was able to play about songs on the player with room for more	1
i gave the new product a try and was satisfied except that after six months it cost half what i paid but this is the most advanced price available	1
my biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my nd generation ipod nano	0
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about feet away	1
this top of the line dvd player is great	1
depressing the scroll button is not always responsive	0
the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
however since i am in an office i normally keep them at a pretty low volume and at low volumes they sound a little weak	0
i found the phones lack of entertaining games very disturbing	0
i have no problem with this mp player	1
price and replaceable batteries were the two main factors in my choice of nomad	1
i like this monitor	1
simply this product was created and was left behind	0
it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
i started accessing and transferring files and found it very slow	0
unfortunately i bought a player because ps cant play all my dvds and now the player cant play everything	0
bottom line great products at unbeatable prices	1
i could easily zoom in to x times the image without a noticeable drop in image quality not even using the best available settings	1
its a really cool gizmo	1
the optical zoom works great and the x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
i ve been using the g for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it is advertised	1
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying	1
lcd screens are very large and highly readable	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
the software failed repeatedly	0
its not as small as my canon slr camera so it fits easily in my pocket	1
not a broken monitor but theres nothing special about it	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	0
many sound options have an equalizer almost like the winamp option	1
if you do nt have tags it ll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	0
it has a nice color screen	1
the cheap user replaceable battery is a great advantage over the ipod is battery which costs to replace	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia so standard headphones will not work	0
i had no distortion issues with this one and was more satisfied with it than any other phone ive used before	1
the monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display	1
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen	1
the movie clips taken will always have some noise in it you can t avoid that	0
this router is awesom but it will only support xbox we have and you can never get more than to have a open nat type the others are usualy moderate or strict when i contaced support they were very nice and tried thre best to get it working right but to no avail bottom line if you just have a computer a laptop and you will be fine and very secure this router is well worth the money	1
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well	1
software is absolutely terrible	0
id love to live in a bigger house but durability is a big issue	0
have had the player since xmass and love it	1
this is extemely lame	0
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
good battery life	1
the phone has one really cool and useful feature a hands free phone	1
all features are reasonably priced	1
it worked well on all of my dvds and rental dvds	1
postscript the remote sometimes looks confused and unresponsive but this may just be operator error	0
chic looks and well built players come in a compact form with metal panels	1
not enough volume when connected to larger headphones or external receivers	0
the second one lasted about two weeks before the video came out	0
after much frustration i finally upgraded the firmware to the latest dd wrt firmware on dd wrts website which solved all my problems	1
after using it for just a month i could not play any dvd	0
after hooking the thing up i found that it would only played less than of the dvds i put in it	0
i didnt manage to make the creative nomadic explorer work	0
if youre traveling around the world this is a very functional phone	1
since its hidden features i let this babe watch dvds from non us regions	1
in places where other phones arent easy to hide i was able to take it with me	1
definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers i ve owned	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp player get nomadic	1
for the price it doesnt get much better than this	1
this software is very easy to use and within minutes of opening my box im out listening to any of my cds	1
my biggest issue is that the speaker is incompatible with my second generation ipod nano	0
i warmly recommend this camera	1
you can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because i gave all the information i could	0
i have it for a week now and this camera has exceeded my expectations	1
the overall image quality is poor when the screen shrinks or malfunctions	0
i m delighted with this product	1
great camera	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
however a phone call to the d link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem	1
you will be changing the track information a lot as the cd database information that the software makes use of is mediocre information at best	0
the speakers work better than any ive ever used	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphones and a high pitched mp	1
windows premium is good lrb does not recommend starting rrbs and is user friendly	1
i dont think i would have found this quality and ease of use as excited as i was about my purchase	1
it did also seem to have a strong new electronics smell for some time	0
