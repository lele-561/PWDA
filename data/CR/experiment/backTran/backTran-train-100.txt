when i tried to install a second dvd player in my brothers house that one didnt work either	0
the g has trouble focusing in low light and wont take pictures when the shutter is pressed but will take pictures a few seconds after the shutter is released	0
this software is not a hassle to me at all	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
i usually avoid horns but i do nt hear anything overly extreme	0
recently bought this coolpix along with a mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with m m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
apex is a solid performer for me	1
the keys were close together and the layout was a little quirky for a standard rectangular layout keyboard but not too weird	0
value comparison of data storage versus price	1
the excellent picture quality is on par with my pioneer panasonic and jvc players	1
i find it too bright	0
my main reason for not being happy with this product however is that it locks up at odd times	0
also i had no problems reading the svcds and vbr mp cds i made	1
but dollar for dollar this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
only owned it for about two weeks so im hoping well see another higher quality progressive scan dvd player soon	0
i am very pleased with it so far	1
bottom line is the price these things sound great and have tons of good bass	1
the bottom line is i have a better set of speakers at creative lab and i trigger the speakers on my computer at least to my ear for less than half the cost	1
im having a problem with my archos	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
and it works great too	1
the speakers have very rich sound and good bass also obviously not pounding bass you need a huge subwoofer	1
finally i bought this monitor for more than you can buy it in the us	0
it works well too	1
it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
fact is it could nt be easier to use	1
i thought this was just the player but then i started checking the disc and found that the apex was actually destroying my media	0
ive had it for about a few weeks now and its the best player ive seen and used	1
the amazing little computer did everything i could hope for work study travel	1
the set up is goof proof and offers a superior result	1

a week out of the box and i began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time growing more frequent each day	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	0
im very happy with it so far	1
first the sound quality is okay but the eax can cause audio interference after about minutes	0
but ive emailed creative tech support and got a prompt response and theyll sort it out for me if necessary	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line but they wo nt answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support stars	1
one last note i purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states	0
ringtones are only accompanied by crazy songs and annoying ringtones with only one ringtone sounding close to a normal ringtone	0
this is the third apex product ive bought and they continue to impress with their prices	1
my socks spilled my beer but didnt wash my car	1
the apex has been a steady performer for me	1
even if the default settings are left in place they produce clear playback	1
the system is far from stable and the code is alpha at best	1
because this camera is beautiful	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs the transfer was fairly painless	1
great phone i d buy another	1
but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
the menu options appear one at a time taking up the whole screen and one has to scroll down one by one or have memorized where they are in the menu order to select them by using the number keypad	0
frequency adjustment is limited due to the built in speaker divider	0
pc cable is too expensive for a usb cable	0
the case is sturdy and stylish but unfortunately lacks a window	0
we are very happy with the squad leader and the company	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0

the scroll wheel is easy to use and works perfectly for me but many people complain that it is bulky and difficult to operate	1

i think its great from a technical point of view and the addition of the speakers makes it even better and i love the phone	1
the g had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	0
it is easy to use and yet very feature rich	1
